"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips is in the house directly left of the flutist, so that's the first house.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies is in the house directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement, so the carnations arrangement must be in the fourth house, and the lilies in the third house.
4. There is one house between the flutist and the pianist, so the pianist must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person with a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The root beer lover lives to the left of the person eating grapes.
2. The person with a television lives to the left of the root beer lover.
3. The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the root beer lover.
4. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person with a gameboy lives.

8. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Let's start with what we know for sure:
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
- The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, House 1: Green, Kiwis

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person with a gameboy live next to each other. Since the first house is occupied, the person who likes blue and the person with a gameboy must be in the second and third houses.

From Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house. So, the percussionist must live in the third house.

Now, let's use Clue 1, 2, and 3 together. The root beer lover lives to the left of the person eating grapes, and both the person with a television and the person who only drinks water live to the left of the root beer lover. This means the root beer lover must be in the third house.

So, House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer

The person eating grapes must be in the second house because the root beer lover is in the third house.

So, House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes

The only person left is the cellist, who must be in the first house.

So, House 1: Green, Kiwis, Water
House 2: Blue, Gameboy, Grapes
House 3: Percussionist, Root Beer, Cellist

The cellist lives in House 3.

The answer is: \(\boxed{3}\)"

2. The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

Let's think about it:

- From clue 2, the swimmer and the person with the bouquet of daffodils are next to each other. So, they can only be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges. So, the person eating oranges can't be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.
- From clue 1, the soccer player is to the left of the person eating oranges. So, the soccer player can't be in house 3.
- From clue 3, the person with the vase of tulips is to the right of the person eating mangos. So, the person eating mangos can't be in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 or 3.

Let's put it all together:
- The soccer player must be in house 1 (because they are to the left of the person eating oranges).
- The person eating oranges must be in house 3 (because the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of them).
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 (because they are next to the swimmer and to the right of the person eating oranges).

- Clue 3 says the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives to the left of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.
- Clue 2 says the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the percussionist. Since the violinist is in the first house, the percussionist must be in the third house.
- Clue 1 says the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.
- Clue 4 says the mystery book reader lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the violinist is in the first house, the mystery book reader must be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second or third house. Given that the percussionist is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.
- Clue 6 says the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live next to each other.

6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start placing the information we know:
- The mystery book reader is in House 2.
- The history book buff must be in House 1 because the bouquet of lilies is in House 2.
- The percussionist is in House 1 because the computer is in House 2.
- The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or 3, so the bird keeper is in House 2.
- The fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1, so the fish enthusiast is in House 3.

Now, let's put this all together:
- House 1: History book buff, Rose bouquet, Flutist, Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Bouquet of lilies, Bird keeper, Percussionist
- House 3: Gameboy, Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Cellist

We need to find where the gameboy lives. From clue 7, the gameboy is directly left of the person with a rose bouquet. So, the gameboy is in House 1.

Let's start placing the houses:

- House 3: Horses (Clue 8 and Clue 5)

- House 4: Person with bouquet of lilies (Clue 4)

Now, the radio and carnations arrangement are next to each other (Clue 9):

- House 3: Carnations

The banana lives one house to the left of the carnations arrangement (Clue 10):

- House 2: Radio and Banana

The banana and cat lover are two houses apart (Clue 13):

- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).
2. Each person in the houses has different shoes, books, and cars.

4. Clue 2 says the person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in house 2.

Since the history book buff is in house 2 and is wearing boots, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and must be a mystery book reader.

So, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different person who likes a different kind of book and plays a different sport.

2. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The golfer lives in the first house.

Let's start with what we know:
- The golfer lives in the first house (House 1).

Now, let's use the clues:
- Clue 3 says the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4. So, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
  - House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

- Clue 1 says the swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1 (since the golfer is there), and the swimmer cannot be in House 4. So, the only possible positions are:
  - House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
  - House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

- Clue 4 says the swimmer does not live in the third house. So, the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

- Clue 2 says the basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be there.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 4: Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."

- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green is in House 1.
- The person who has a gameboy is in House 2.

So, the sequence is:
- House 1: Green (gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (computer)
- House 3: Blue (phone)

The person who likes yellow is in House 2, and the person who likes green is in House 1. The person who likes blue must be in House 3.

So, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person with different favorite things:
- Favorite color: red, white, green, yellow
- Favorite drink: water, root beer, tea, coffee
- Favorite book: mystery, history, romance, science fiction

Here are the clues:
1. There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.

7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 7, the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.
- From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.
- From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in house 4, so the history book buff must be in house 1 or 2.
- From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green.
- From clue 1, there are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

So, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."

3. The person in house 1 is a fantasy book reader.
4. The person in house 2 is a fish lover and likes yellow.
5. The person in house 2 had spaghetti for lunch.

From these clues, we can figure out:
- The person in house 1 has a radio and likes green.
- The person in house 2 has a fish and likes yellow.

So, the person in house 2 must be the cat lover because the fish lover is in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

- The dog owner and the person who likes red are next to each other (Clue 14), so the person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue (Clue 2), so the person who likes milk lives in the first house and the person who likes blue lives in the second house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red (Clue 5), so the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first or second house. But since the second house is already taken by the dog owner and the person who likes blue, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first house.
- The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice (Clue 6), so the person who owns horses lives in the first or second house. But the first and second houses are already taken, so the person who owns horses must live in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth or fifth house.
- The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff (Clue 3), so the bird keeper lives in the first or second house. But the first and second houses are already taken, so the bird keeper must live in the first house, and the history book buff lives in the third or fourth house.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The flutist lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the cellist in the third house.
4. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house and the guitarist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, and the person who is eating oranges in the fourth house.
6. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the guitarist, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house.
8. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house. This is consistent.
11. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house. This is also consistent.
12. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker in the fourth house.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

- House 2: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- House 3: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- House 4: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3. So:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Daffodils

From clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2. If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already there. So the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4, but house 4 already has daffodils. So the carnations must be in house 3:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner (lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

From clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3:

- House 1: Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- House 2: Tulips (horse owner)
- House 3: Dog owner (lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (carnations)

So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person in the first house has a phone.
2. The person in the second house does not wear boots.
3. The person with horses lives next to the person with a radio.

From clue 1, we know the first house has a phone. So, the second house cannot have a phone.

From clue 2, the person in the second house does not wear boots. This means the person in the first house must be wearing boots.

From clue 3, the person with horses and the person with a radio are next to each other. Since the first house has a phone, the person with a radio must be in the second house. This means the person with horses must be in the first house.

So, the first house has boots and horses, and the second house has high heels and a radio.

The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

1. From Clue 1 and Clue 9, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other. So, the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who is wearing loafers, and the person who has a computer must be in the same house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house (Clue 2), they must live in house 1 or 2.

2. From Clue 3, the person who is eating apples does not live in the first house. So, the person who is eating apples must live in house 2 or 3.

3. From Clue 4, the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the person who is wearing boots. So, the person who is wearing boots must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who is eating grapes must live in house 2 or 3.

4. From Clue 5, there is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives. So, the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 3.

5. From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house. So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in house 1 or 2.

6. From Clue 7, the person who had pizza does not live in the second house. So, the person who had pizza must live in house 1 or 3.

7. From Clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who is eating mangos must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 2 or 3.

8. From Clue 10, the person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone. So, the person who has a computer must live in house 1 or 2, and the person who has a phone must live in house 2 or 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce:
- The person who ate grilled cheese, the person who is wearing loafers, and the person who has a computer must be in house 1.

- From clue 1, the basketball player cannot be in the first house.
- From clue 2, the basketball player must be in the first house because the swimmer must be to the right of the basketball player.
- So, the basketball player is in the first house and the swimmer must be in the third house.
- From clue 4, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house because the dog owner must be in the third house.
- From clue 5, the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house.
- From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the first house and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already taken by the bird keeper. So, the tennis player must be in the first house and the cat lover must be in the second house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

Let's think about it:

- From clue 1, the person who likes white can't be in house 3, so they must be in house 2 or 3.
- From clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV can't be in house 3 (clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are next to each other. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not next to each other, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue can't be in house 1 or 3. So, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From clue 5, the violinist can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is to the right of the person who likes white (clue 7), the person who likes white can't be in house 3, so they must be in house 2, and the guitarist must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the swimmer must be in house 3 because the SUV is in house 2.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. So, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.

Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person in house 1 is eating kiwis.
2. The person in house 2 can't be eating a banana, so they must be eating mangos.
3. The person in house 2 drives a truck because the person in house 1 and house 3 can't drive a truck.
4. The person in house 3 can't own an SUV because the person in house 2 drives a truck and the person in house 1 can't own an SUV.
5. So, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

The person who ate stew is in House 5.

- House 5: Stew eater

   - Since the person who only drinks water is in House 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 3.

9. The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 4, the flutist must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the flutist must be in House 3.

10. The person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes milk.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person who does a different sport, drives a different car, drinks a different drink, and has a different bouquet of flowers.

Here are the clues:
1. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live next to each other.
3. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

7. The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Let's start placing the information:

- From clue 9, the minivan is in house 4.
- From clue 10, the root beer lover is in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 3: Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan

Now, let's use clue 8:
- The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- So, the basketball player is in house 1, and the truck driver is in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Truck driver

Next, use clue 5:
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
- So, the lilies must be in house 2 or 3 or 4. But house 2 is the truck driver, and house 3 is the root beer lover. So, the lilies must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 4: Lilies

Now, use clue 2:
- The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live next to each other.
- Since lilies are in house 4, daffodils must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 3: Daffodils

Now, use clue 1:
- There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
- The coffee drinker and tennis player must be in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. But house 2 is the truck driver, and house 4 is the lilies. So, the coffee drinker and tennis player must be in houses 1 and 3.

Since house 3 is the daffodils, the tennis player must be in house 1, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 3: Coffee drinker

Now, use clue 3:
- The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
- The swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Sedan

Finally, we know:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Sedan
- House 4: Minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

So, the answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

Since the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, they must be in House 3:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Oranges

The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)

The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)
- House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)
- House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)
- House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)
- House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)

So, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in the second house. So, the second house is red.

From clue 1, since the second house is red, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we know:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second or third house. But the second house is already red, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

But wait! The third house is already the mystery book reader. So, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

Now we know:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

- The person who is wearing high heels is in the second house, so the person with a phone must be in the third house.
- The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner, so if the cat lover is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house, but the second house is already taken by the person with a phone. So, the cat lover must be in the second house, and the dog owner must be in the third house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover, so the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives one house to the left of the person who is wearing loafers, so if the person who is wearing loafers is in the third house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house, but the second house is already taken.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the first house (House 1) has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The basketball player doesn't live in the first house, so they must live in the second house (House 2).
3. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person eating apples. Since House 2 is to the right of House 1, the person with a radio must live in House 2, and the person eating apples must live in House 1.
4. The person with a radio also lives to the right of the violinist. Since the radio person is in House 2, the violinist must be in House 1.

So, the violinist lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player must be in the fifth house because the tennis player is in the third house and the soccer player has to be to the right of the tennis player.

So, the soccer player is in House 5, and the grilled cheese is in House 4 (clue 2).

Now, we know:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 6, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the stew must be in House 1 and the spaghetti must be in House 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

The cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the running shoes are in the second house. So, the loafers must be in the first house.

From clue 2 and clue 4, we know the person who likes white and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other. And the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti are also next to each other. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house, and the person who likes white must be in the first house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know there are three houses in a row, numbered 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each person in these houses eats a different fruit: grapes, oranges, or mangos.
3. Each person drinks a different drink: coffee, root beer, or water.

Here are the clues:
1. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house. So, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house.
3. **Clue 4:** The person eating oranges does not live in the second house. So, the person eating oranges must live in either the first or the third house.
4. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos. This means the coffee drinker cannot be in the third house (since there would be no house to the right for the mango eater).

### Putting It All Together:

- If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. But this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). So, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.
- If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

So, the root beer lover lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first or third house. But the first house is already taken by the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is for spaghetti and the second house is for boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

Here are the clues we have:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.
2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the fifth house.
4. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house.
6. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
7. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
8. There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
9. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
10. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
11. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.
12. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
13. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
14. There are two houses between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who is eating grapes lives.
15. The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
16. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the second house.
17. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
18. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
19. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.

From these clues, we can start filling in the information:

- The science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
- The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
- The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

So, we can place these:

1. ?
2. Truck, Gameboy
3. Science Fiction
4. Banana, Oranges
5. ?

Now, we know the gameboy and oranges are in houses 2 and 4. The truck is in house 2, so the gameboy must be in house 3.

Next, we know the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house, and the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who had pizza, and there is one house between them.

So, we can place stew and pizza:

1. Stew
2. Truck, Gameboy
3. Pizza, Grapes
4. Banana, Oranges
5. Grilled Cheese, Kiwis

The mystery book reader and the romance book lover live next to each other. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the second house, and the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

So, the mystery book reader must be in house 1.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is (E) 4.
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house, so the tennis player must live in the second house.

Since the first house has the mystery book reader, the second house must have the fantasy book enthusiast.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

   - House 1: Pizza
   - The person who likes blue must be in House 1.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses and 4 people, each with different characteristics. Let's use the clues to figure out where each person lives.

1. The cellist lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Cellist

2. The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
3. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
6. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
8. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
11. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
12. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start with what we know:
- House 1: Cellist

Now, let's use Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- The basketball player is to the left of the person who likes red.
- The basketball player is to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's try House 2 for the basketball player:
- House 2: Basketball player
- The person wearing running shoes must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Let's try House 3 for the basketball player:
- House 3: Basketball player
- The person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

Now, let's use Clue 7 and Clue 10:
- The flutist is to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- The flutist is to the right of the cricketer.

Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's try House 2 for the flutist:
- House 2: Flutist
- The cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Let's try House 4 for the flutist:
- House 4: Flutist
- The cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).

Let's try House 3 for the flutist:
- House 3: Flutist
- The cricketer must be in House 2.

Now, let's use Clue 9:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

Let's try House 2 for the flutist:
- House 2: Flutist
- The cricketer must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Finally, let's try House 4 for the flutist:
- House 4: Flutist
- The cricketer must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).

After all these attempts, we find that the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Cricketer
- House 3: Flutist
- House 4: Running shoes

Now, let's use Clue 12:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Since the flutist is in House 4, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 (but House 2 is the cricketer, so this is not possible).

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"The person who likes red lives in the first house.

So the answer is:
(C) 1"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. **House 1:**
   - Wearing running shoes
   - Not the first house for the dog owner, bird keeper, or computer owner.

2. **House 2:**
   - Not the first house for the dog owner, bird keeper, or computer owner.
   - Not the first house for the fish enthusiast, tennis player, or radio owner.
   - Not the first house for the bouquet of lilies or rose bouquet.

3. **House 3:**
   - Wearing boots
   - Not the first house for the dog owner, bird keeper, or computer owner.
   - Not the first house for the fish enthusiast, tennis player, or radio owner.
   - Not the first house for the bouquet of lilies or rose bouquet.

4. **House 4:**
   - Swimmer
   - Not the first house for the dog owner, bird keeper, or computer owner.
   - Not the first house for the fish enthusiast, tennis player, or radio owner.
   - Not the first house for the bouquet of lilies or rose bouquet.

5. **House 5:**
   - Not the first house for the dog owner, bird keeper, or computer owner.
   - Not the first house for the fish enthusiast, tennis player, or radio owner.
   - Not the first house for the bouquet of lilies or rose bouquet.

Now, let's use the clues:

- **Clue 13:** The person wearing running shoes is in House 1.
- **Clue 17:** The person wearing boots is in House 3.
- **Clue 7:** The swimmer is in House 4.
- **Clue 18:** The tennis player is in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper is not in House 4, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in House 1, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 12, the dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a radio is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the cat lover must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live next to each other.
3. The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live next to each other.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the kiwi eater lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the dog owner cannot live in the first house, so the dog owner must live in the second house.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other. Since the dog owner is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the person wearing high heels must be in the second house.

From clue 3, the tennis player and the apple eater live next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the apple eater must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

The only sport left is cricket, and the only book genre left is mystery. So, the cricketer must live in the second house.

12. There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives.
    - Bird keeper must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

13. The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
    - House 2: Oranges

14. The person who is eating grapes must live in the first house.
    - House 1: Grapes

So, the person who is eating grapes lives in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know:
1. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
3. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.
5. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
6. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.

12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
13. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know:
- House 4: Fried Rice

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Green

From clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. So, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. So, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. So, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. So, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. So, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

From clue 13, if pizza is in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person eating grapes doesn't live in the first house. So, the person in the second house must be eating grapes.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house. So, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house. So, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From these clues, we can figure out:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes, the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, so the person who is eating kiwis must live in the third house.
3. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue is in the second house, the person who likes green cannot be in the second house. So, the person who likes green must be in the first house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in the first house and the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Person eating oranges (and likes blue)
- House 3: Person eating kiwis

The person who likes white must be in the third house because the person who likes green is in the first house.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (House 1) and one on the right (House 2). Each house has a person living there, and we know some things about them:

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

From clue 1, the root beer drinker must be in House 2 because they live to the right of the person with roses. So, the person with roses must be in House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, roses
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person has a different pet and a different kind of car.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who drives a minivan lives to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the fish enthusiast and the dog owner:
- The fish enthusiast (F) must be in house 1 because the dog owner (D) is directly to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- So, the dog owner (D) must be in house 2.

Now, using clue 2, there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- This means the truck owner (T) must be in house 4.

Using clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- So, the sedan owner (S) must be in house 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be to the right of the fish enthusiast (F):
- This means the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3, but house 3 is already taken by the sedan owner (S).

So, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 4, but house 4 is already taken by the truck owner (T).

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- So, the cat lover (C) must be in house 1, but house 1 is already taken by the fish enthusiast (F).

Re-evaluating again:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

So, the dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"

2. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk lives in the fourth house because the person who likes yellow is in the third house and the root beer lover is in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house. Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue must be in the fourth house because the person who likes yellow is in the third house and blue lives to the right of yellow.

   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the person with the gameboy is in house 2.

2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the dog owner cannot be there. So, the dog owner must be in house 2.

- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)
- House 3 and House 4: The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other (from Clue 4).

Since the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6), we can deduce:

- House 3: The person who likes milk (since it must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water)
- House 4: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who only drinks water (since they must be next to each other and to the right of the person who likes milk)

The remaining characteristics are:
- Grilled cheese
- Fried rice
- Coffee
- Yellow

Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the coffee drinker cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in House 1 or 2. Given that the person who likes green does not live in the first house, the coffee drinker must be in House 1, and the person who likes green must be in House 2.

- House 4: Horse owner

Since the person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house, they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

So, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
- The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, so the coffee drinker is in the third house and the person wearing sandals is in the fourth house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, so the coffee drinker is in the third house.
- The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer, so the swimmer is in the second house and the golfer is in the third house.
- The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes, so the person with lilies is in the first house and the person with grapes is in the second house.

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.

The answer is: (A) 1"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the houses are numbered 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.
2. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house. So, the soccer player is in house 3.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person with lilies is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2 and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From these clues, we can fill in the details:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player with spaghetti

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
3. The pianist lives in the third house.
4. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
6. The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
9. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
10. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
12. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

Let's start placing the information we know:

- From clue 2, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
- From clue 3, the pianist lives in the third house.
- From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Now, let's use clue 7:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house, so the person who likes red is the pianist.

Next, let's use clue 10 and clue 11:
- The percussionist and the cellist live next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist.

So, the percussionist and cellist must be in House 1 and House 2, or House 2 and House 3. But since the pianist is in House 3, the percussionist and cellist must be in House 1 and House 2.

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- The person who likes yellow must be in House 4, so the person who had stew must be in House 3. But House 3 is already occupied by the pianist, so the person who had stew must be in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.

So, we have:
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, let's use clue 8:
- There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
- The person who likes yellow is in House 4, so the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 5.

Since the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (clue 5), and the person who likes red is in the third house, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 5. But the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 5, so the person who likes green must be in House 5.

So, we have:
- House 1: Percussionist, likes green
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: Cello, likes white

The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

So, the answer is (D) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person wearing different shoes and eating different food for lunch. Each person also has a favorite drink. Here are the clues:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
2. The person who had stew lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Let's start with the tea drinker:
- House 3: Tea drinker

Next, we know the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti:
- So, stew can be in house 1 or 2, and spaghetti can be in house 2 or 3.

The root beer lover is to the right of the person who is wearing sandals:
- So, sandals can be in house 1 or 2, and root beer can be in house 2, 3, or 4.

The person who only drinks water is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese:
- So, grilled cheese can be in house 2, 3, or 4, and water can be in house 3 or 4.

The person who is wearing running shoes is to the left of the person who had stew:
- So, running shoes can be in house 1 or 2, and stew can be in house 2 or 3.

The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live next to each other:
- So, these two must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house:
- So, grilled cheese can be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 2: Stew (because it's to the left of spaghetti)
- House 4: Water (because it's next to high heels)
- House 1: Running shoes (because it's to the left of stew)

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the person with a radio lives in the third house.
2. The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. The cricketer also lives in the third house.
4. The person wearing loafers lives in the third house.

So, the third house has:
- Radio
- Cricketer
- Loafers

The fourth house has:
- Basketball player

The root beer lover does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second or third house. But since the third house is already full, the root beer lover must live in the second house.

The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person with a radio, so the second house has:
- Root beer lover

The person with a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the second house must have:
- Root beer lover, Gameboy
- Grilled cheese

The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and they live somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. So, the first house must have:
- Tea drinker, Milk, High heels

The soccer player and the person with a computer live next to each other. Since the third house already has the radio, the fourth house has the basketball player, and the second house has the gameboy and grilled cheese, the only place left for the computer and soccer player is the first and second houses. But since the gameboy is in the second house, the computer must be in the first house, and the soccer player must be in the second house.

So, the first house has:
- Tea drinker, Milk, High heels

The second house has:
- Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese

The third house has:
- Radio, Cricketer, Loafers

The fourth house has:
- Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

The person who has a computer lives in the third house.

"The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

So, the answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house is the pianist's house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes white cannot be in the second house, so they must be in the first house.

So, the first house has:
- A pianist
- Likes white

From clue 2, we know:
- The root beer lover must be to the right of the person who owns horses.
- Since the first house is the pianist's, the person who owns horses cannot be in the first house. So, the person who owns horses must be in the second house.

This means:
- The second house has:
  - Owns horses
  - Cannot be the root beer lover (because the root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner)

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner, the root beer lover must be in the second house.

So, the second house has:
- Owns horses
- Is the root beer lover

The dog owner cannot be in the second house (because the root beer lover is there), so the dog owner must be in the first house.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The answer is: (A) 1"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know:
1. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
2. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

So, we can write:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: ?
- House 4: Pizza

Next, we know:
- There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

Next, we know:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

So, the violinist can be in houses 1, 2, or 3. The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

We also know:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

From the clues, we can deduce:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 because the percussionist is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- The percussionist is in house 2.
- The history book buff is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person who likes green must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2, or the person who likes green must be in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 3.

6. The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means the horse owner must be in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who owns horses must be in House 1.

8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person with sandals must be in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must be in House 2 or House 3.

From all these clues, we can figure out:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

So, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in house 3.
- From clue 2, the person eating mangos must live in house 2 because the person eating apples is in house 3.
- From clue 3, the coffee drinker cannot live in house 2, so the coffee drinker must live in house 1.
- From clue 1, the coffee drinker (in house 1) is directly left of the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

So, the person who likes milk lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.

2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

From the clues, we can place the carnations arrangement in House 1, the science fiction book fanatic in House 2, and the vase of tulips in House 2. The person who likes white must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic
- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

So, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."

So, the person with the rose bouquet lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who wears boots does not live in the second house. So, the boots-wearer can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.

9. The person who wears loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 5, we know the yellow person is in house 3. So, the gameboy and yellow person must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the yellow person is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 2.

From clue 9, the loafers person is in house 1.

From clue 8, the tennis player is in house 3.

From clue 10, the phone person must be in house 2, and the radio person must be in house 3.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who wears sandals. Since the tennis player is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2, and the sandals-wearer must be in house 3.

From clue 11, the swimmer lives to the left of the green person. Since the green person must be in house 2 (because the yellow person is in house 3 and the gameboy is in house 2), the swimmer must be in house 1.

So, the cricketer lives in house 2.

But we need to find where the cricketer lives. From the clues, we can see that the cricketer must be in house 4 because the sandals-wearer is in house 3, and the cricketer is directly left of the sandals-wearer.

From clue 5, the fried rice eater is to the right of the romance book lover, so they must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Yellow lover
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle together!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different person living there, and each person has a different device, flower, and sport.

Here are the clues:
1. The tennis player lives to the left of the person with a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person with a computer and the person with tulips live next to each other.
4. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with roses.
5. The person with a radio lives to the right of the person with a television.

Let's think step by step:

- From clue 2, the golfer can only be in house 1 or house 3.
- From clue 3, the computer and tulips must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From clue 5, the radio cannot be in house 1, so it must be in house 2 or 3.
- From clue 4, the radio must be to the right of the roses, so the roses cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.

Now, let's try to fit everything together:

- If the golfer is in house 1, the computer and tulips must be in houses 2 and 3. But then the radio would have to be in house 3, which means the roses would have to be in house 1. This doesn't work because the golfer is in house 1 and the roses cannot be there.

- So, the golfer must be in house 3. This means the computer and tulips must be in houses 1 and 2. The radio must be in house 2 because it has to be to the right of the television and the roses.

- The television cannot be in house 1 (because the tennis player is to the left of the television), so it must be in house 2. This means the roses must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Roses
- House 2: Television
- House 3: Radio

The person with the computer and tulips are in houses 1 and 2. Since the computer and tulips are next to each other, the computer must be in house 1 and the tulips in house 2.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in house 1.

3. Clue 2 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house. So, the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

Now, let's put the information together:
- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, Grilled cheese

Since the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner. And since the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese, the person in house 1 must have eaten something else. The only other option is stew.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person with a phone lives in the third house.
2. The flutist lives in the third house.
3. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

So, the third house is occupied by:
- The person with a phone
- The flutist
- The person wearing running shoes

4. The gameboy lives to the right of the flutist, so it must be in the fourth house.
5. The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

6. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
7. The romance book lover lives in the first house.

8. The person wearing high heels lives two houses away from the fantasy book enthusiast.
9. The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other.
10. The person eating oranges lives to the right of the person wearing boots.
11. The saxophonist lives to the left of the person wearing boots.
12. The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
13. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.

From the clues, we can place the following:
- The first house: romance book lover
- The second house: science fiction book fanatic
- The third house: phone, flutist, running shoes
- The fourth house: gameboy, percussionist

Since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the person wearing boots and the third house is occupied by the flutist and running shoes, the person wearing boots must be in the first house.

So, the first house is occupied by:
- The romance book lover
- The person wearing boots

The second house is occupied by:
- The science fiction book fanatic

The third house is occupied by:
- The phone
- The flutist
- The running shoes

The fourth house is occupied by:
- The gameboy
- The percussionist

The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Since the third and fourth houses are occupied, the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

So, the person eating oranges lives in the third house.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to figure out where the person who is eating apples lives.

Here are the clues:
1. The root beer lover and the milk drinker live next to each other.
2. The pizza eater lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater.
4. There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover.
5. There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater.
6. The pizza eater lives directly left of the yellow lover.
7. The orange eater lives directly left of the apple eater.
8. The stew eater does not live in the third house.
9. The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker.
10. The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater.
11. The apple eater lives to the right of the pizza eater.

Let's start placing the clues:
- From clue 2 and 6, we know the pizza eater and the yellow lover are next to each other, and the tea drinker is to the right of the yellow lover.
- From clue 7, the orange eater and the apple eater are next to each other, and the apple eater is to the right of the pizza eater.
- From clue 9, the stew eater and the water drinker are next to each other, and the stew eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- From clue 8, the white lover is to the right of the stew eater.
- From clue 4, the red lover and the yellow lover are next to each other, and the red lover is to the left of the yellow lover.
- From clue 3, the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are two houses apart, and the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other.

Let's try to place them:
- The stew eater and the water drinker must be in houses 2 and 3 because the stew eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The red lover and the yellow lover must be in houses 1 and 2 because the red lover is to the left of the yellow lover.
- The root beer lover and the milk drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 because the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other.
- The pizza eater and the yellow lover must be in houses 2 and 3 because the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover.
- The orange eater and the apple eater must be in houses 3 and 4 because the orange eater is to the left of the apple eater.
- The stew eater and the water drinker must be in houses 2 and 3.
- The white lover must be in house 4 because the white lover is to the right of the stew eater.

So, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 2: Stew eater, water drinker, pizza eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Orange eater, apple eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

So, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the clues given.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
7. The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
8. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.

From clue 7, we know:
- House 1: Convertible

From clue 6, we know:
- House 2: SUV (because it's directly left of the history book buff)

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with running shoes is in a house to the left of the person with high heels.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person with sandals is in a house to the right of the person with boots.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the history book buff.

From clue 9, we know:
- The person who drives a convertible is to the left of the person who is wearing boots.

Now, let's put the pieces together:
- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

So, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house too, and the saxophonist and violinist live next to each other.
3. So, the violinist must live in the third or fifth house.

Now, let's use the other clues:
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.
5. The history book buff and the guitarist have one house between them. The only houses left are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff is in the first house, and the guitarist is in the fifth house.
6. The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house because the romance book lover is to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

The violinist is in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - So, House 4 has the Television.

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2 has the Loafers.

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 has Loafers, the phone can't be there. So, the phone must be in House 1, 3, or 4.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since House 2 has Loafers, the boots must be in House 1.

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. The only possible pair is House 1 and House 3.

   - House 1 has Boots, so House 3 must have Sandals.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Boots, Radio
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The only device left is the Gameboy, and it must be in House 4.

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The second house has high heels.

From clue 5, we know:
- The third house has running shoes.

So, the first house must have loafers.

Now, let's think about the drinks:
- Clue 3 says the milk drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house has loafers, the milk drinker must be in the third house.
- Clue 4 says the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house has loafers, the coffee drinker must be in the third house too, but we already said the milk drinker is there. So, the coffee drinker must be in the second house.

Therefore, the second house has high heels and the coffee drinker.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

Since the person wearing loafers can't live in the first house, they must live in the second house.

If the mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different person living there, and each person has different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the clues given.

Here are the clues:
1. The person with running shoes and the person with a gameboy live next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person with sandals.
3. The person with running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
5. The person with carnations lives somewhere to the left of the person with sandals.
6. The person with running shoes lives directly left of the person who had stew.
7. The person with a television lives directly left of the person with a radio.
8. The person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
9. The person with boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person with a radio.

Let's start solving it:

- From clue 1 and 8, the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other.
- From clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals.
- From clue 3, the person with running shoes is not in the third house.
- From clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person with pizza.

- From clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person with pizza.
- From clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person with a radio.

By putting these clues together, we can figure out the arrangement:

- The person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other. Since the person with running shoes is not in the third house, they must be in House 1 and House 2.
- The person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person with pizza. So, if the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
- The person with sandals is to the right of the person with carnations.
- The person with running shoes is directly left of the person who had stew.
- The person with a television is directly left of the person with a radio.
- The person with boots is to the left of the person with pizza.
- The person with spaghetti is directly left of the person with a radio.

After putting all these clues together, we find that the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).
2. Each person is eating a different fruit: one is eating mangos and one is eating apples.
3. Each person has a different kind of flower in their foyer: one has a rose bouquet and one has a bouquet of lilies.
4. Each person plays a different musical instrument: one is a pianist and one is a saxophonist.

Now, let's use the clues:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies. So, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person with the lilies lives in house 2.
2. The saxophonist does not live in the first house. So, the saxophonist must live in house 2.
3. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.

So, we can fill in the details:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

The person eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

So, the answer is: (D) 4"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different flower in the foyer and a different kind of car. Here are the clues:

1. The person with tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives directly left of the person with lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
4. The person with a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's think about it:

- From clue 1, the tulips can only be in house 1 or house 2.
- From clue 2, if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2. If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3.
- From clue 3, the sedan and the rose bouquet must be next to each other.
- From clue 4, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2.

Let's try the possible placements:

1. If the rose bouquet is in house 1:
   - The sedan must be in house 2 (from clue 3).
   - The SUV must be in house 2 (from clue 2), but this is not possible because the sedan is already in house 2.
   
2. If the rose bouquet is in house 3:
   - The sedan must be in house 2 (from clue 3).
   - The SUV must be in house 2 (from clue 2), but this is not possible because the sedan is already in house 2.

So, let's try another way:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1:
  - The sedan must be in house 2.
  - The SUV must be in house 2, but this is not possible.
  
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3:
  - The sedan must be in house 2.
  - The SUV must be in house 2, but this is not possible.

The only way to fit everything is:

- The rose bouquet is in house 1.
- The sedan is in house 2.
- The SUV is in house 2, but this is not possible.
- The lilies are in house 3.
- The tulips are in house 2.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the clues given.

- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Now, let's use the clues to place the rest:
- Clue 3: The person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live next to each other. So, they must be in House 2 and House 3 or House 3 and House 4.
- Clue 4: The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live next to each other. So, they must be in House 2 and House 3 or House 3 and House 4.
- Clue 9: The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house. So, they must be in House 1, House 3, House 4, or House 5.
- Clue 10: The violinist does not live in the fourth house. So, they must be in House 1, House 2, or House 3.
- Clue 7: The percussionist lives to the left of the mystery book reader. So, the percussionist must be in House 1, House 2, or House 3, and the mystery book reader must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4.
- Clue 8: The violinist lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. So, the violinist must be in House 1, House 2, or House 3, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can place the remaining people:
- House 1: Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Coffee drinker

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
2. The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.
3. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible, so the cricketer can be in the first, second, or third house.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
5. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white.
6. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house, so the SUV must be in the first house.
7. The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other, so the banana must be in the second house.
8. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white, so the white must be in the third house, and the minivan is in the second house.
9. The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other, so the blue must be in the second house.
10. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house. Since the first house is yellow and kiwis, the second house is blue and banana, and the third house is white, the soccer player must be in the first house.
11. The cricketer lives in the third house.
12. The swimmer lives in the first house.

Now we know:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. So, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live next to each other.
   - So, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew can't be in the third house, so they must be in the first house.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the first or third house. But since the first house has stew, the grilled cheese must be in the third house.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew is in the first house, and the romance book lover is in the second house.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different flower, musical instrument, car, pet, and favorite color. We need to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

2. There is one house between the percussionist and the truck driver.
3. The sedan owner lives next to the fish lover.
4. The yellow lover lives in the third house.

6. The horse owner and the blue lover live next to each other.
7. The carnations are in the first house.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start with what we know:
- House 1 has carnations.
- House 3 has yellow.

Now, let's use the clues:
- Clue 1: Tulips and the bird keeper are next to each other. Since House 1 has carnations, they must be in House 2.
- Clue 4: Yellow is in House 3.
- Clue 5: There is one house between the horse owner and the rose bouquet. Since House 3 has yellow, the horse and rose must be in House 1 and 2.
- Clue 6: The horse owner and the blue lover are next to each other. Since the horse is in House 1, the blue lover must be in House 2.
- Clue 3: The sedan owner is next to the fish lover. Since the blue lover is in House 2, the fish lover must be in House 1.
- Clue 2: There is one house between the percussionist and the truck driver. Since the horse is in House 1 and the blue lover is in House 2, the percussionist and truck driver must be in House 2 and 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Carnations, blue, fish
- House 2: Tulips, bird keeper
- House 3: Yellow

The bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person in the first house likes green and is a fantasy book reader.
2. The person in the first house is also a cellist.
3. The person in the second house likes red and is a mystery book reader.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the golfer lives in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

Since the golfer is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic can't be there. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in either the first or the third house.

But the history book buff is already in the first house, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

This means the swimmer must be in the first house because there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

So, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each person in the houses has different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the clues given.

1. The swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 5 to place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

The baseball player must be in House 4 (Clue 11):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover

- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater

- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who owns horses must be in House 4:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each person did something different:
- One ate fried rice and one ate spaghetti.
- One has a cat and one has horses.
- One likes history books and one likes romance books.
- One is wearing sandals and one is wearing running shoes.

We have two clues:
1. The person wearing sandals lives next to the person who has horses.
2. The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's use these clues to figure out who lives where.

From clue 1, we know:
- If the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 has horses.
- If the person in house 2 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 1 has horses.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who likes history books lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 2, because the history book lover must be to the right of them.

So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2"
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

Let's start placing what we know:
- Clue 3: The person with carnations lives in the fourth house.
- Clue 6: The person with a rose bouquet lives in the third house.

Now, using Clue 8:
- There is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Next, using Clue 4:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, using Clue 2:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- The mystery book reader and the swimmer are in the first and second houses, so the mystery book reader must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, using Clue 5:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Finally, using Clue 7:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- The fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Now, using Clue 9:
- There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

14. The television does not live in the fifth house.
15. The water drinker and saxophonist live next to each other.
16. The phone lives to the right of the rose bouquet.

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- The coffee drinker is in the third house.
- The milk drinker is in the fifth house.
- The television is in the fourth house (since it cannot be in the fifth house and must be to the right of the cellist).

Now, let's place the gameboy and computer:

- The gameboy lives directly left of the computer.
- This means the gameboy is in the fourth house and the computer is in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is for the computer.

So, the gameboy is in the fourth house and the computer is in the fifth house.

Next, we know the root beer lover is not in the first house. Let's place the root beer lover:

- The root beer lover is in the first house.

Now, we need to place the remaining flowers and drinks:

- The carnations arrangement is directly left of the percussionist.
- The violinist is to the left of the percussionist.
- The phone and vase of tulips are next to each other.
- The water drinker and saxophonist are next to each other.
- The phone is to the right of the rose bouquet.

From these, we can deduce:

- The water drinker is in the second house.
- The vase of tulips is in the third house.
- The rose bouquet is in the second house (since the phone is to the right of the rose bouquet and the phone and vase of tulips are next to each other).

So, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

The correct answer is:

Let's start solving it:

- From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.
- From clue 1, the person who wears boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, the person who wears boots lives in the second house.
- From clue 8, the golfer lives in the first house.
- From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the golfer is in the first house, the cricketer must be in the second house.
- From clue 5, the person who had pizza does not live in the second house. So, the person who had pizza must live in the third house.
- From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. So, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the first house.
- From clue 3, the person who wears running shoes does not live in the first house. So, the person who wears running shoes must live in the second house.
- From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who owns a sedan. Since the cricketer is in the second house and the golfer is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.

11. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
12. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other, and the cellist is to the left of the coffee drinker, we can place them in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the flutist, so:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist, so:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover

- The person who likes milk is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and there are two houses between the person who likes milk and the person who likes blue:
  - House 1: Cellist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Saxophonist
  - House 4: Coffee drinker
  - House 5: Percussionist
  - House 1: Root beer lover
  - House 1: Yellow
  - House 2: Blue
  - House 4: Grilled cheese
  - House 5: Milk

So, the percussionist lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. We know that the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Fried Rice

2. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

4. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green could live in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

5. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue could live in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti could live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white could live in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese could live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - If the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3.
   - If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow would live in House 4.
   - If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow would live in House 5.

Since House 3 is already occupied by the person who ate fried rice, and House 4 is occupied by the person who had stew, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

So, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Let's think about this step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. The percussionist lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.

From clue 2, we know the percussionist is in the second house. So, the second house is not for the violinist or the basketball player.

From clue 1, the person who likes red is in the third house. So, the third house is not for the basketball player or the tennis player.

From clue 3, the violinist must be in the first or second house because the basketball player is in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow is not in the second house, so it must be in the first or third house. But since the third house is for the person who likes red, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

From clue 5, the basketball player must be in the third house because the tennis player is in the first house.

So, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person with a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover. So, the computer is in house 1 and the root beer lover is in house 2.
2. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the person with a vase of tulips. We don't know who has the vase of tulips yet, but we know the cellist is somewhere to the right.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.
4. There is one house between where the person with a phone lives and where the person with a television lives. So, if the phone is in house 1, the television must be in house 5.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist. Since the cellist is in house 5, the daffodils must be in house 4.
6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person with a gameboy. Since the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3).
7. The person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. So, the carnations arrangement can be in house 1, 2, 4, or 5.
8. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3.
9. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).
10. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person with a phone. Since the guitarist is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1.
11. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 5.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 4.
13. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the daffodils must be in house 4.
14. There is one house between where the person with a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives. Since the daffodils are in house 4 and the coffee drinker is in house 3, this is correct.
15. The person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house. So, the carnations arrangement can be in house 1, 2, 4.
16. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), this is correct.

So, the person with a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living there. Each person has different characteristics like flowers, musical instruments, cars, books, and pets. We need to figure out which person lives in which house.

Here are some clues to help us:

1. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
2. The saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
3. There is one house between where the person who drives a convertible lives and where the bird keeper lives.
4. The pianist lives to the right of the bird keeper.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the fourth house.
7. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the fifth house.
8. The bird keeper lives to the left of the person who owns a sedan.
9. There are two houses between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the cellist lives.
10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the history book buff live next to each other.
11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the cat lover.
12. The person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the history book buff.
13. The person who has a rose bouquet lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
14. The flutist does not live in the first house.
15. The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the romance book lover.
16. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
17. The history book buff does not live in the fifth house.
18. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
19. The person who drives a minivan does not live in the fourth house.
20. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- The person with daffodils (D) and cat (C) are next to each other, with D to the left of C.
- The person with a convertible (CV) is next to the fish enthusiast (FE), and FE is to the right of the romance book lover (RB).
- The saxophonist (Sx) and the science fiction book fanatic (SF) are next to each other.
- The fantasy book enthusiast (FB) and the history book buff (HB) are next to each other.
- The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
- The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
- The person with a carnations arrangement (CA) and the cellist (C) are two houses apart.
- The pianist (P) lives to the right of the bird keeper (B).
- The person with a convertible (CV) is to the left of the history book buff (HB).
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils (D) is to the left of the cat (C).
- The person with a rose bouquet (R) is to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF).

- The person who drives a minivan (MV) does not live in the fourth house.
- The person who owns an SUV (SU) lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet (R).

By placing these clues, we can deduce:

- House 1: SU, D, C
- House 2: CV, FE, RB
- House 3: Sx, SF, FB
- House 4: P, B
- House 5: HB

So, the person who drives a minivan (MV) lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the dog owner lives in House 2.
2. The fish enthusiast lives in House 3.
3. The minivan cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 4 or 5.
4. The truck lives directly left of the computer, so if the truck is in House 1, the computer must be in House 3. But House 3 is already taken by the fish enthusiast, so the truck cannot be in House 1. If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4. If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5. If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2, but the dog owner is in House 2, so this is not possible. If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3, but the fish enthusiast is in House 3, so this is not possible either. Therefore, the truck must be in House 2 and the computer in House 4.
5. The minivan cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 4 or 5. But the truck is in House 2, so the minivan must be in House 5.
6. The gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the radio, and the gameboy cannot be in House 2. So the gameboy must be in House 1, and the radio in House 2, but the dog owner is in House 2, so the gameboy must be in House 1 and the radio in House 3.
7. The vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the horses. The only house left for the horses is House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4.
8. The carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips live directly next to each other. So the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
9. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the gameboy, so the bird keeper must be in House 1.
10. The bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 5, so it must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4. But the gameboy is in House 1, the dog owner is in House 2, the fish enthusiast is in House 3, and the vase of tulips is in House 4, so the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1.
11. The bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the truck. The truck is in House 2, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1.
12. The television and the SUV must have one house between them. The only houses left are House 1 and House 3, so the television must be in House 1 and the SUV in House 3.

So, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is: \(\boxed{4}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person with different pets, foods, sports, instruments, and drinks. Here are the clues:

1. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

From clue 5 and clue 6, we know the basketball player and the saxophonist both live in house 1. This means there's a problem because they can't both be in the same house. Let's re-evaluate the clues:

- Clue 2 says the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. So, the cricketer must be in house 2 and the tea drinker in house 1.
- Clue 4 says the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. So, the dog owner must be in house 2 and the person who had pizza in house 1.
- Clue 5 says the basketball player lives in house 1. So, the basketball player is in house 1.
- Clue 6 says the saxophonist lives in house 1. So, the saxophonist is in house 1.

Since the basketball player and the saxophonist both live in house 1, we need to find another way to fit the clues. Let's assume the saxophonist lives in house 3 instead.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3 says there is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. So, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively.
- Clue 7 says the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. So, the person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The cat lover doesn't live in the second house, so the cat lover must live in the first house.
3. The person in the second house is wearing high heels.
4. The person in the first house is wearing loafers.
5. The person wearing high heels is to the right of the person with the computer.
6. The person with the computer is in the first house, so the person in the second house must be wearing high heels.

From this, we can figure out:
- The first house has the history book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The second house has a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels.

So, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person living there. Each person has a different flower, plays a different instrument, eats a different fruit, and had a different lunch.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who eats apples lives in the third house.
2. The person who eats kiwis does not live in the fourth house.
3. The person who eats mangos does not live in the fifth house.
4. The person who eats apples lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
7. The pianist does not live in the fifth house.
8. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 3: Apples

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. So, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 2, which is already occupied by pizza. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 4.

From clue 6, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

So, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"Let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
2. There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.
3. The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. The person with a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
12. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
13. The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
14. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 2: History book buff (Clue 3)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (Clue 12)

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 3 because there is one house between the history book buff (House 2) and the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 10 and Clue 10, the person who had pizza must live in House 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in House 3 (since the person who had pizza is to the left of the person who ate fried rice).

Now, let's place the flowers and instruments:

- House 1: Pizza (Clue 10)
- House 3: Fried rice (Clue 10)

From Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff
- House 3: Fried rice, Yellow

From Clue 4, the person who has a carnations arrangement cannot live in House 4, so it must live in House 1.

- House 1: Pizza, Carnations

From Clue 13, the guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist
- House 3: Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- House 4: White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- House 1: Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist

From Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, which is already in House 1.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, which is in House 3.

- House 1: Pizza, Carnations, Blue
- House 2: Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist, Percussionist
- House 3: Fried rice, Yellow, Vase of tulips
- House 4: White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

Finally, the cellist must live in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a person who plays a different musical instrument and eats a different kind of fruit. Here are the clues:

1. The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

Let's think about it:

- From clue 1, the pianist and the kiwi-eater are next to each other.
- From clue 2, the flutist is to the right of the violinist.
- From clue 3, the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.
- From clue 4, the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

If we put the violinist and the kiwi-eater two houses apart, the only way they can be next to the pianist is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi-eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

The question asks which house the pianist lives in. The answer is:

(A) 3"
"Okay, let's think about this together!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each person likes a different kind of book and eats a different kind of fruit.

From the clues:
1. The person who likes fantasy books doesn't live in house 1.
2. The person who eats kiwis lives in house 1.

Since the person who eats kiwis is in house 1, the person in house 2 must be eating oranges. Also, because the person who likes fantasy books can't be in house 1, they must be in house 2.

So, the person who likes fantasy books lives in house 2.

The answer is:
(B) 2"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different person with different characteristics. Here are the clues:

1. The bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other.
2. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner.
4. The cat lover lives to the right of the bird keeper.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. The person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From clue 8 and clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the second house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house. But the third house is already occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From clue 4, the cat lover lives to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who has a television lives to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).
2. There are two people, one who likes root beer and one who likes tea.
3. There are also two musical instruments: a pianist and a cellist.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who likes root beer does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly to the left of the cellist.

From clue 1, we know the root beer lover lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the pianist is to the left of the cellist. Since the first house is on the left and the second house is on the right, the pianist must be in the first house and the cellist must be in the second house.

So, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."

1. We know the person with the carnations lives in the fifth house.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives directly left of the person with loafers. So, the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house, and loafers in the fifth house.
3. The person with sandals cannot live in the fifth house, so they must live in the first, second, or third house.
4. There is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with a bouquet of lilies.
5. The person with the vase of tulips lives to the right of the person with daffodils.
6. The person with the vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house, which we already know.
7. The person with the carnations lives in the fifth house.
8. The person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live next to each other.

From these clues, we can start placing things:

- House 5: Carnations
- House 4: Vase of Tulips (because it's next to loafers)
- House 5: Loafers

Now, the person with sandals can't be in House 5, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Let's try House 1:

- House 1: Sandals

Now, we need to place the running shoes and the bouquet of lilies. They must be one house apart. Let's try House 2 for daffodils and House 3 for running shoes:

- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes

This fits with the clue that the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live next to each other.

So, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, and each house has a person with different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house.

Here are the clues:
1. There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
2. The baseball player does not live in the second house.
3. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives.
6. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives.
7. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
8. There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
9. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives.
10. The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
11. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start with clue 10: The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the swimmer and the person who likes white are in consecutive houses.

From clue 9: The tea drinker is one house to the right of the person who likes white.

From clue 3: The person who only drinks water is one house to the right of the tea drinker.

From clue 4: The swimmer is one house to the left of the person who only drinks water.

So, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Person who likes white
- House 3: Person who only drinks water
- House 4: Tea drinker

Now, let's use clue 5: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

From clue 7: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

From clue 6: There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

From clue 8: There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.

From clue 12: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

From clue 11: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By putting all this together, we can deduce:
- House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water
- House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges, Tea drinker

From this, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

So, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each person in these houses ate something different for lunch, has a favorite color, and wears different shoes. Here are the clues:

1. The person wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, let's figure out the shoes and favorite colors:

- House 1: White, Boots, Red (since white and green are already taken)
- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green (already assigned)
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White (since red and green are already taken)

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a different flower in the foyer and a different kind of book that the person likes.

2. The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with tulips.
4. The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
5. The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Let's start with clue 5:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Now, using clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
- Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Let's think about it:
- If the science fiction book fanatic is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast would have to be in the second house, but we already know the second house has a rose bouquet. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with tulips.
- This means the romance book lover and the tulips must be in consecutive houses.

Using clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations.
- Since the romance book lover and the tulips are consecutive, and the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations, the carnations must be in the second house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using clue 3 again:
- The romance book lover is directly left of the tulips.
- Since the carnations are in the second house, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the tulips must be in the fourth house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations
3. Romance book lover
4. Tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

The answer is:
(C) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, one on the left (House 1) and one on the right (House 2).
2. Each person has a favorite drink, wears different shoes, and likes different books.
3. The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house (House 1).

Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the coffee drinker must also be in House 1. This means the person in House 2 is the one wearing sandals.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Sandals, romance book lover

So, the romance book lover lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).
2. One person is a pianist and the other is a percussionist.
3. One person has a radio and the other has a phone.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From clue 4, we know:
- The percussionist must live in house 1 because it's to the left of house 2.
- So, the person in house 2 must have the radio.

Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the person in house 2 has the radio, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2 has a convertible.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes yellow is in a house to the left of the person who owns a sedan.
- This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. But house 2 already has the convertible, so this is not possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1. This is possible.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 0, so this is not possible.

So, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1, and the person who owns a sedan must be in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
- Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

- House 3: White

The person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

11. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
    - House 1: Sedan, Bird Keeper
    - House 2: Sandals, Cat Lover, Rose Bouquet
    - House 3: Truck, Loafers, Kiwis, Lilies

12. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
    - House 1: Sedan, Bird Keeper
    - House 2: Sandals, Cat Lover, Rose Bouquet
    - House 3: Truck, Loafers, Kiwis, Lilies, Tulips

13. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
    - House 3: Truck, Loafers, Kiwis, Lilies, Tulips, Daffodils
    - House 4: Oranges, Dog Owner, Boots, High Heels

14. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
    - House 3: Truck, Loafers, Kiwis, Lilies, Tulips, Daffodils
    - House 4: Oranges, Dog Owner, Boots, High Heels, Horses

15. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.

    - House 3: Truck, Loafers, Kiwis, Lilies, Tulips, Daffodils
    - House 4: Oranges, Dog Owner, Boots, High Heels, Horses
    - House 5: Horses, Grapes, Sandals

From all these steps, we can see that the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

So, the answer is:
**(C) 3**"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 houses in a row, and each person ate something different for lunch: fried rice, spaghetti, or grilled cheese.
2. Each person also likes a different kind of book: science fiction, fantasy, or mystery.

Here are the clues:
1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice is in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast is in the second house.

Since the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast are in the same house, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who ate fried rice (fantasy book enthusiast) lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. This means the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The only food left is grilled cheese, and the only book left is mystery. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. So, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person in house 2 is eating kiwis.
2. The person in house 1 drinks water and wears sandals (from clue 1 and 2).
3. The person in house 1 cannot wear high heels because the person wearing high heels is directly right of the person drinking water.
4. The person in house 2 cannot wear sandals because the person in house 1 is wearing them.
5. So, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (the only option left for them).

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The answer is: (A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, one on the left (House 1) and one on the right (House 2).
2. Each person has a different device and wears different shoes.
3. They also have different drinks and eat different fruits.

Here are the clues:
- The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
- The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
- The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person wearing high heels is in the left house (House 1) and the person wearing sandals is in the right house (House 2).

From clue 3, we know:
- The tea drinker is in the left house (House 1) and the person with a television is in the right house (House 2).

So, we can put it together like this:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

The only fruit left is kiwis, so the person in House 1 must be eating kiwis.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist.
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

Let's place the tea drinker first:
- House 1: Tea drinker

Now, let's think about the other clues:
- The water drinker must be to the right of the cellist. So, the cellist can't be in house 3, and the water drinker must be in house 2 or 3 if the cellist is in house 1 or 2.
- The violinist and the guitarist must have one house between them. So, they can't be in houses 1 and 3, or 2 and 3. This means the violinist and guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the violinist and guitarist can't be in house 1. So, the violinist and guitarist must be in houses 2 and 3.

If the violinist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 3. This means the cellist must be in house 1 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

The guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The person wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From clue 1 and clue 7, we know:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who wears sandals also lives in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who wears sandals, so the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person wearing loafers lives. Since the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker and the fifth house, the coffee drinker and the person wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who wears sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, and each house has a different person with a different device and ate a different lunch. Here are the clues:

1. The person with a gameboy and the person with a computer live next to each other.
2. The person with a television lives to the left of the person with a phone.
3. There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person with a radio lives.
4. There is one house between where the person with a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person with a radio does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. The person with a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing what we know:

- House 4: Pizza (from clue 7)
- House 2: Radio (from clue 6 and 7, since the radio can't be in the fourth house and the computer can't be there either)

Now, we know:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: ?
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: ?

From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So:
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Now we have:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From clue 1, the person with a gameboy and the person with a computer live next to each other. The only places left are House 1 and House 2, or House 3 and House 4, or House 4 and House 5. Since House 2 is already Radio and House 4 is Pizza, the only possible pair is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer

Now we have:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person with a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives. So:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

The only place left for fried rice is House 3, but that's already Grilled cheese. So, the only place left is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

The only devices left are television and phone. From clue 2, the person with a television lives to the left of the person with a phone. So:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Phone

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

The answer is (E) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have 5 houses and 5 people with different characteristics. We need to figure out which person lives in which house based on the clues given.

1. The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses.

17. The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
18. The pianist does not live in the third house.
19. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
20. The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

Let's start placing the information we know for sure:
- House 1: Tennis player (Clue 16)
- House 2: Bird keeper (Clue 8)
- House 4: Percussionist (Clue 17)
- House 5: Cat lover (from Clue 13 and Clue 12)

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:
- Clue 1: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses. So, the pianist must be in House 2 and the horse owner in House 3.
- Clue 4: The person who is eating apples does not live in the second house. So, the apple eater must be in House 3, 4, or 5. But since the horse owner is in House 3, the apple eater must be in House 4 or 5.
- Clue 5: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. So, the fried rice eater and the orange eater must be in Houses 3 and 4 or 4 and 5.
- Clue 10: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. So, the stew eater and the banana eater must be in Houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- Clue 11: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other. So, the saxophonist and the grilled cheese eater must be in Houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- Clue 12: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. We already know the tennis player is in House 1, so the baseball player must be in House 2.
- Clue 13: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover. We already know the cat lover is in House 5, so the basketball player must be in House 4.
- Clue 14: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives. So, the saxophonist must be in House 3 and the golfer in House 5.

Now we have:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Golfer
- House 5: Cat lover

The person who is eating a banana lives in House 4.

So, the answer is \boxed{4}."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know there are two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2).
2. Each person in these houses does different things:
   - One person is a percussionist and the other is a guitarist.
   - One person had pizza and the other had grilled cheese.
   - One person has a dog and the other has a bird.

3. From the clues:
   - The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper.
   - The percussionist does not live in the second house.

4. Since the percussionist does not live in house 2, they must live in house 1.
5. If the percussionist is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1. So, the bird keeper must be in house 2.
6. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 1 (because they live to the right of the bird keeper).
7. This means the pizza eater must be in house 2 (since the grilled cheese eater is in house 1 and the bird keeper is in house 2).

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We know:
- The cat lover lives in the first house.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
- The flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- The person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist.
- The cat lover lives in the first house.

From these clues, we can start filling in the houses:

1. **House 1:** Cat lover
2. **House 2:** This house can't be the cat lover, so it must be someone else.
3. **House 3:** This house can't be the cat lover either, so it must be someone else.

Now, let's use the clues to figure out who lives where:

- The cat lover is in House 1, so the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, so the person eating a banana can't be in House 3.
- The flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast, so the fish enthusiast can't be in House 3.
- The person who is eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, so the pianist can't be in House 3.
- The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, so the person wearing running shoes can't be in House 3.
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist, so the flutist can't be in House 2.

From these, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3.
- The flutist must be in House 3.
- The person eating oranges must be in House 3.

So, the only person left for House 2 is the percussionist.

Now, let's fill in the rest:
- The cat lover in House 1 must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

The only book type left is science fiction, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

We have 4 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person eating a different fruit and each person likes a different color. Here are the clues:

1. The person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
2. The person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
4. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
6. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

Let's start with clue 6:
- The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, house 2 is grapes.

Now, let's use clue 2 and clue 5:
- The person who likes green and the person who likes red live next to each other.
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.

Since the person who likes red is next to the person who likes green, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red, we can place the colors and fruits like this:
- If the person who likes green is in house 1, then the person who likes red must be in house 3.
- This means the person who likes white must be in house 4 (one house to the right of house 3).

Now, let's use clue 4:
- The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Yellow

Now, let's use clue 1 and clue 3:
- The person who likes red lives to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.

Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1. This leaves house 4 for the person who is eating a banana.

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Banana

Now, we need to assign the fruits and colors:
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since the person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes yellow is in house 4).
- The person who likes yellow must be in house 4 (already assigned).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, Green
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red, Mango
- House 4: Banana, Yellow

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know that the person eating oranges is in house 1.
2. The mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader on the left.
3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in house 2.

Now, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."

1. We know the person who has daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
3. The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 3, the first house has the root beer drinker and the vase of tulips.
From clue 2, the second house has the water drinker.
From clue 4, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in the third house.
From clue 5, the person with the television (in the third house) is to the right of the person with the vase of tulips (in the first house).

So, the first house has the root beer drinker and the vase of tulips.
The second house has the water drinker.
The third house has the television.

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are in adjacent houses. Since the second house has the water drinker, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 2, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

So, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Loafers

2. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with a phone can't be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.

4. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Not boots

5. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Not kiwis

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers (from clue 1 and 3)
- House 2: Water, Phone (from clue 2 and 3)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (from clue 4, 5, and 6)

So, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

- From clue 7, the cricketer can't be in house 3.
- From clue 3, the golfer and the baseball player must be next to each other.
- From clue 4, the person with carnations and the horse owner must be next to each other.
- From clue 5, the person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player.
- From clue 6, the person with roses must be to the left of the person with daffodils.

Let's start placing things:

- Since the golfer can't be in house 3 and the cricketer can't be in house 3, the baseball player must be in house 3.
- The golfer and the baseball player are next to each other (clue 3), so the golfer must be in house 2.
- The person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player (clue 5), so the person with carnations must be in house 1.
- The person with carnations and the horse owner are next to each other (clue 4), so the horse owner must be in house 2.

Now we know:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Baseball player

The fish lover must be to the left of the horse owner (clue 2), so the fish lover must be in house 1.
- The person with roses must be to the left of the person with daffodils (clue 6), so the person with roses must be in house 1, and the person with daffodils must be in house 3.

So, the person who owns horses lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. We know the person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Oranges

2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible must be in consecutive houses.

3. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner cannot be in House 3, and the bird keeper cannot be in House 1.

4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - So, the person eating mangos must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person eating mangos must be in House 2.

5. The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Horses

6. The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person eating mangos is in House 2, the person driving a convertible must be in House 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Oranges

- House 3: Horses, Truck

From this, we can see that the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

- From clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. So, the percussionist cannot be in the first house.
- From clue 2, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. So, the mystery book reader cannot be in the last house.
- From clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. So, the romance book lover cannot be in the first house.
- From clue 9, there is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. So, the history book buff cannot be in the first or last house.
- From clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. So, the mystery book reader cannot be in the last house.
- From clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

Now, let's place the mystery book reader and the romance book lover:
- The mystery book reader and the romance book lover must be in houses 1 and 3, with the history book buff in house 4.

Next, place the percussionist and the guitarist:
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. So, the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the guitarist cannot be in the first or second house.
- The only possible arrangement is:
  - Guitarrist in house 2, Percussionist in house 3, and the person who had stew in house 4.

Now, place the remaining people:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist, and the only remaining houses are 1 and 2. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the flutist must be in house 3.
- The saxophonist and the person who had pizza must be in houses 4 and 5. Since the person who had stew is in house 4, the saxophonist must be in house 5.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Science fiction book fanatic
2. Fantasy book enthusiast
3. Flutist
4. Stew
5. Saxophonist

The percussionist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.
2. The romance book lover lives in the third house.

From clue 18, the person who is eating grapes is in House 2 (since the romance book lover is in House 3).

From clue 16 and 15, we know:
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Spaghetti (since the mystery book reader is in House 5)

From clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in House 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2 is grapes, House 3 is romance book lover, and House 4 is grilled cheese, so the person who is eating mangos must be in House 5.

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 5.

The answer is: (E) 5."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who has a radio lives in the third house too.

So, House 3: Green, Radio

3. The cellist does not live in the fifth house, so the cellist can live in House 1, 2, or 4.

4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means if the percussionist is in House 1, the white person is in House 2. If the percussionist is in House 2, the white person is in House 3. If the percussionist is in House 3, the white person is in House 4. If the percussionist is in House 4, the white person is in House 5.

5. The percussionist and the guitarist live next to each other. So, if the percussionist is in House 1, the guitarist is in House 2. If the percussionist is in House 2, the guitarist is in House 1. If the percussionist is in House 3, the guitarist is in House 4. If the percussionist is in House 4, the guitarist is in House 3.

6. There is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives. If the guitarist is in House 1, the yellow person is in House 3. If the guitarist is in House 2, the yellow person is in House 4. If the guitarist is in House 3, the yellow person is in House 5. If the guitarist is in House 4, the yellow person is in House 2.

7. There are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives. If the percussionist is in House 1, the violinist is in House 4. If the percussionist is in House 2, the violinist is in House 5. If the percussionist is in House 3, the violinist is in House 1. If the percussionist is in House 4, the violinist is in House 2.

8. The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who likes red. If the person who likes red is in House 2, the television is in House 1. If the person who likes red is in House 3, the television is in House 2. If the person who likes red is in House 4, the television is in House 3. If the person who likes red is in House 5, the television is in House 4.

9. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. If the gameboy is in House 1, the phone can be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. The person who likes red does not live in the second house.

11. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.

12. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.

After trying different combinations, we find that the saxophonist lives in House 4.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) 4"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each house has a person living there, and we know some things about them:

1. One person likes tea, and the other likes root beer.
2. One person plays the cello, and the other plays the guitar.
3. One person has horses, and the other is a cat lover.
4. One person reads mystery books, and the other reads history books.

We also have some clues:
1. The person who plays the cello lives to the left of the person who reads mystery books.
2. The person who reads history books lives to the left of the cat lover.
3. The person who likes root beer and the person who likes the guitar live next to each other.

Let's try to figure it out:

- Since the cello player must be to the left of the mystery book reader, the cello player can only be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book reader must be to the left of the cat lover, so the history book reader can only be in house 1, and the cat lover must be in house 2.
- The root beer lover and the guitarist live next to each other, so they must be in house 1 and house 2, but we already know the cello player and the mystery book reader are in house 1 and house 2. This means the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in house 1 and house 2, but we need to figure out who is who.

Since the cello player and the history book reader are in house 1, and the mystery book reader and the cat lover are in house 2, the only people left are the root beer lover and the guitarist. They must be in house 1 and house 2, but we need to figure out who is who.

The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know there are 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3.
2. Each house has a different pet: one has a dog, one has a cat, and one has a bird.
3. Each house also has a different flower: one has roses, one has tulips, and one has carnations.

Now, let's use the clues:

1. The person with carnations lives to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person with tulips lives to the right of the dog owner.

From clue 2, we know the dog owner can only be in house 1 or house 3.

From clue 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2 or house 3, and they must be to the right of the dog owner.

From clue 1, the person with carnations must be in house 2 or house 3, and they must be to the right of the bird keeper.

If the dog owner is in house 1, then the bird keeper must be in house 2 (because the bird keeper can't be in house 1, and the dog owner can't be in house 2).

If the bird keeper is in house 2, then the person with carnations must be in house 3 (because the person with carnations must be to the right of the bird keeper).

So, the person with tulips must be in house 2 (because the dog owner is in house 1, and the person with carnations is in house 3).

Therefore, the person with tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We know:
1. The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in the fourth house and the vase of tulips is in the third house.
3. The person with high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a vase of tulips, so the person with high heels must be in the first or second house.
4. The person eating apples does not live in the third house.
5. There is one house between where the person with boots lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
6. The person with loafers does not live in the second house.
7. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person with sandals.
8. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person with a computer.
9. The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
10. The person with loafers does not live in the third house.
11. The person with a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana.
12. The person with a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The cricketer is in the fourth house.
- The vase of tulips is in the third house.
- The person with high heels must be in the first or second house.
- The person with loafers must be in the first or fourth house (since it can't be in the second or third house).

Since the person with a rose bouquet is directly left of the person eating a banana, the person with a rose bouquet must be in the first house and the person eating a banana must be in the second house.

So, the person with loafers must be in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. We know the person who eats mangos lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Mangos

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - So, the horse owner can't be in House 1.

3. The bird keeper and the person who eats kiwis live next to each other.
   - This means they are in two consecutive houses.

4. The person who eats bananas does not live in the third house.
   - So, the banana eater can't be in House 3.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - So, the horse owner can't be in House 2.

6. The person who eats bananas lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3.

Now, let's put this all together:

- House 1: Mangos (from clue 1)
- House 2: Bananas (from clue 6)
- House 3: Dog (from clue 6)
- House 4: Kiwi (since the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be next to each other, and the only options left are House 4 and House 1, but House 1 is already taken by the bird keeper)

The horse owner can't be in House 1, 2, or 3, so the horse owner must be in House 4.

So, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From clue 2, if the bird keeper is to the left of the history book buff, and the mystery book reader is in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 1 and clue 3, since the romance book lover does not live in the third house and the history book buff is in the third house, the romance book lover must be in the first house.

So, the romance book lover lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"The coffee drinker lives in the second house.

So, the answer is (D) 2."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. But the soccer player already lives in the third house, so this must be re-evaluated.

From clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. This aligns with clue 7, confirming the soccer player lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is (D) 3."

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, using Clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and spaghetti in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Clue 4 says the mystery book reader does not live in the second house. So, the mystery book reader must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Clue 5 says the person who had stew lives to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Clue 1 says the person who had stew lives to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Clue 3 says the golfer lives to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Clue 2 says there is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Clue 7 says the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, we know the characteristics for each house:

- House 1: High heels, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils, Spaghetti, History book buff
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck. From clue 5, the minivan must be to the right of the truck. From clue 2, the truck and gameboy are next to each other. From clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the minivan. So, the truck must be in house 1, the gameboy in house 2, and the minivan in house 3.

Now, the minivan and cellist are next to each other (clue 3), so the cellist must be in house 2. The flutist is in house 1 (clue 6).

The high heels and television are next to each other (clue 4), and the boots are to the right of the percussionist (clue 7). Since the flutist is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 3.

So, the percussionist lives in house 3.

4. The flutist lives in the third house.
5. The cellist and the flutist live next to each other, so the cellist must be in the second house.
6. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house, so the basketball player likes white.
7. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the red lover can't be in the fourth house, the red lover must be in the first house, and the sedan owner must be in the second house.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese can't be in the fourth house, so it must be in the first, second, or third house. Since the red lover is in the first house, the grilled cheese eater must be in the second house.
9. The person who had stew doesn't live in the fourth house, so it must be in the first, second, or third house. Since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater can't be in the fourth house, the stew eater must be in the third house, and the pizza eater must be in the second house.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist can't be in the first house. Since the sedan owner is in the second house, the saxophonist must be in the third house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

- House 1: Grilled cheese eater

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Bird keeper

From clue 9, we know:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper

From clue 8, since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

From clue 9, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1, so the guitarist must be in house 3 or 4. But since house 3 is already the spaghetti eater, the guitarist must be in house 4.

From clue 9, the saxophonist must be in house 5, but we only have 4 houses, so the saxophonist must be in house 3.

From clue 4, the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart. Since the bird keeper is in house 2 and the violinist is in house 3, the rose bouquet person must be in house 1.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

From clue 3, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist. Since the guitarist is in house 4, the pizza eater must be in house 4.

So, the arrangement is:

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know the saxophonist lives in the first house (House 1) from Clue 4.
2. The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other (Clue 2), so the golfer must live in the second house (House 2).
3. The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other (Clue 3). Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.

- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

- From Clue 3, the basketball player and the tennis player must be next to each other.
- From Clue 4, the person who ate spaghetti and the person wearing loafers must be next to each other.
- From Clue 5, the tea drinker and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

So, the tea drinker lives in House 4.

The answer is (E) 4."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
3. The vase of tulips is in the fifth house.
4. The bouquet of lilies is in the second house.

10. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
11. The person who ate fried rice is two houses away from the person who had stew.
12. The coffee drinker is to the left of the person who likes yellow.

Let's start placing the things we know:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

Now, let's use the clues to place the rest:

- Since the person who likes blue is directly left of the person who had pizza, and the tea drinker is in house 1, the person who likes blue must be in house 2, but house 2 is already taken by lilies. So, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the person who had pizza must be in house 4.
- The person who ate fried rice is two houses away from the person who only drinks water. Since house 2 and house 5 are taken, the only possible places are house 1 and house 3, or house 3 and house 5. But house 3 is taken by blue, so the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3, and the person who only drinks water must be in house 5.
- The person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and the bouquet of lilies is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.
- The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live next to each other. Since house 3 and house 4 are taken, the only possible places are house 2 and house 3, or house 3 and house 4. But house 2 is taken by lilies, so the person who likes yellow must be in house 4, and the person who likes red must be in house 5.
- There is one house between the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since house 1 and house 2 are taken, the only possible places are house 1 and house 3, or house 2 and house 4. But house 3 is taken by blue, so the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.
- The root beer lover does not live in the third house, so the root beer lover must be in house 1, 2, 4, or 5. But house 1 is taken by white, house 2 is taken by lilies, and house 5 is taken by red, so the root beer lover must be in house 4.
- The coffee drinker is to the left of the person who likes yellow, so the coffee drinker must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 is taken by white, house 2 is taken by lilies, and house 3 is taken by blue, so the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

So, the person who likes green must be in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."

From clues 12 and 13, we know:
- House 1: Vase of tulips, Spaghetti

From clue 14, the rose bouquet cannot be in house 2.

From clue 3, the baseball player and tennis player must be in houses 2 and 3, with the baseball player in house 2 and the tennis player in house 3.

From clue 5, the minivan and convertible must be next to each other. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 2 and the convertible in house 3.

From clue 10, the sedan must be in house 3 and the truck in house 4.

From clue 7, the lilies must be in house 4.

From clue 6, the fried rice eater must be in house 3 or 4. Since the cat lover is in house 4, the fried rice eater must be in house 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each person in these houses has different characteristics:

1. Favorite color: one likes red and one likes yellow.
2. Fruit: one is eating oranges and one is eating grapes.
3. Book: one reads mystery books and one reads fantasy books.
4. Car: one drives a truck and one drives a convertible.

2. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's use these clues to figure out who lives where:

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- So, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who drives a truck is in house 1, the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
- So, if the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
- If the person who drives a truck is in house 1, the person who is eating grapes is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
- So, if the mystery book reader is in house 2, the person who is wearing boots is in house 1.
- If the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots is in house 2.

Combining all these clues, we can see that:
- If the person who drives a truck is in house 2, then:
  - The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
  - The person who is eating grapes is in house 1.
  - The person who is wearing boots is in house 1.
  - The mystery book reader is in house 2.

This means:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow, eats grapes, and wears boots.
- House 2: Person who drives a truck and reads mystery books.

The person who reads fantasy books must be in house 1.

So, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is:

From the above steps, we can see that the person who ate fried rice lives in House 2.

So, the answer is:
(B) 2"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in the first house, and the person who had pizza must be in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot be in the first house, and the person who likes white must be in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

6. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

7. The person who likes red lives one house away from the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the first, second, or fourth house.

Let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot be in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

So, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We have 3 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 3. Each house has a different person living in it, and each person does a different thing:
- One person plays a musical instrument: cellist, violinist, or percussionist.
- One person plays a sport: soccer, basketball, or cricket.

Here are the clues:
1. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2 and clue 3, we know the second house is taken by both the basketball player and the violinist. But that can't be right because only one person can live in each house. So, we need to think about the clues differently.

Let's try this:
- If the violinist is in the second house, then the basketball player can't be there.
- The cellist must live to the right of the cricketer, so the cricketer can't be in the third house.

If we put the cricketer in the first house, then the cellist must be in the third house (because the cellist lives to the right of the cricketer).

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Now, the basketball player must be in the first or third house. But since the cricketer is in the first house, the basketball player must be in the third house.

This means the soccer player must be in the first house.

So, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - So, the coffee drinker is in house 2, and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
   - So, the mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - So, the history book buff is in house 3, and the person with lilies is in house 4.

5. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - So, the person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
   - So, the person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1, and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - So, the person who likes red is in house 1, and the tea drinker is in house 2.

10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The tea drinker lives in house 1.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. So, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the milk drinker must be in House 1.

So, the correct placement is:
- House 1: Milk drinker, Basketball player
- House 2: Violinist, Root beer lover
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

The fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 1. The pianist lives in house 2, and since they live next to each other, the daffodils must be in house 1.

7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since House 3 has daffodils and House 4 has a minivan, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, House 2 has tulips.

8. The person who eats grapes does not live in the fifth house.
   - So, House 5 must have lilies and a convertible.

9. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has carnations.
   - The person with carnations must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils).
   - Since House 3 has daffodils, the person with carnations must be in House 1.
   - Therefore, House 5 has lilies and a convertible, and House 4 has a sedan.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

The answer is:
(E) 5"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
2. The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
4. The soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the soccer player is in house 2. Since the romance book lover cannot be in house 1 (clue 2), the romance book lover must be in house 2. But we already know the soccer player is in house 2, so the romance book lover can't be there. This means the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Now, since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

We have 5 houses in a row, numbered 1 to 5. Each house has a person who likes a different color, plays a different sport, and has a different bouquet of flowers.

Here are the clues:
1. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
2. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. The soccer player does not live in the first house.
5. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
6. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
9. The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
10. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
11. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
12. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start with the bouquet of daffodils in the second house (Clue 8):
- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 6, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, so the person who likes yellow must live in House 1:
- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must live in House 3:
- House 3: Red

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer. Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 11, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9, the person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must live in House 2 or 4. But House 2 is already occupied by the daffodils, so the baseball player must live in House 4, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must live in House 5.

- House 4: Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 12, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must live in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must live in House 1, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in House 4.

- House 1: White
- House 4: Rose

From Clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must live in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must live in House 3, and the swimmer must live in House 4.

- House 3: Green, Swimmer

Now, we have the following assignments:
- House 1: Cricketer, Yellow, White
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Green, Swimmer
- House 4: Rose, Baseball
- House 5: Carnations

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the computer must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Violinist and has a computer.
- House 2: Must be the bird keeper.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step using the clues provided.

From clue 4, we know:

From clue 5, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 12, we know:
- House 3: TV

From clue 10, we know:
- House 4: Pizza

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 15, we know:
- Stew is not in House 2, so it must be in House 5.

From clue 17, we know:
- Phone is not in House 4, so it must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 already has Gameboy, and House 2 has Boots, and House 3 has TV, so Phone must be in House 5.

From clue 16, we know:
- Running Shoes and Computer are next to each other. Since House 3 has TV, Running Shoes and Computer must be in Houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But House 2 has Boots, so they must be in Houses 3 and 4. Since House 4 has Pizza, Computer must be in House 3 and Running Shoes in House 4.

From clue 18, we know:
- Computer is right of Daffodils. Since Computer is in House 3, Daffodils must be in House 2.

From clue 19, we know:
- Daffodils are right of Tulips. Since Daffodils are in House 2, Tulips must be in House 1.

From clue 8, we know:
- Rose Bouquet is left of History Book. Since Rose Bouquet is in House 1, History Book must be in House 2.

From clue 6, we know:
- Carnations are left of Running Shoes. Since Running Shoes are in House 4, Carnations must be in House 3.

From clue 14, we know:
- Carnations are left of Science Fiction. Since Carnations are in House 3, Science Fiction must be in House 4.

From clue 13, we know:
- Loafers are left of Mystery Book. Since Mystery Book is in House 4, Loafers must be in House 3.

From clue 11, we know:
- Romance Book is left of Daffodils. Since Daffodils are in House 2, Romance Book must be in House 1.

From clue 7, we know:
- Sandals are right of High Heels. Since High Heels are in House 1, Sandals must be in House 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy, Rose Bouquet, Tulips, Romance Book
- House 2: Boots, Daffodils, High Heels, Sandals
- House 3: TV, Carnations, Computer, Loafers
- House 4: Pizza, Running Shoes, Science Fiction
- House 5: Phone, Stew

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person with a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person with an SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4, since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV.

From clue 5, we know:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3, since the person in House 3 owns a sedan, we can place the sedan in House 3.

From clue 2, the person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. The only remaining option for the dog owner is House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

Now, we need to find out who is wearing running shoes. The only person left is the one in House 3, who is wearing running shoes.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle step by step!

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Kiwis
   - House 3: Blue

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Carnations

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Tulips

6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - But we already know the third house is blue, so the second house must be boots, and the first house must be green.
   - So, House 1: Green
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Blue

7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Running shoes

8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - Since the third house is blue, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.
   - But the first house is green, and the second house is boots, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Apples (since the first house is green and we need to fit the remaining fruit)

So, the person who is eating apples lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. So, the history book buff must live in the third house.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television. This means the person with a television must live in the second house.
4. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the television and the history book buff are already in the second and third houses, the only devices left are a computer and a phone. The computer must be in the second house because it's to the right of the phone.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (with a computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only book type left is science fiction, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the second house.
