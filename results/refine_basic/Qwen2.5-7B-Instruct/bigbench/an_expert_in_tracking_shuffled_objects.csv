"Given the clues and the arrangement of houses, let's deduce the correct house for the person with a vase of tulips.

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Flutist

From clue 2:
- The person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 (directly left of House 2).

From clue 3:
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 3 (directly left of House 4, where the person with a carnations arrangement lives).

From clue 4:
- The pianist must be in House 4 (since there is one house between the flutist in House 2 and the pianist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Vase of tulips
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Carnations arrangement

The person with a vase of tulips lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To determine the house number where the cellist lives, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.

- House 2: Blue, Gameboy
- House 3: (Not Blue, Not Gameboy, Not Green, Not Kiwis)

From Clue 7:
- House 3: Percussionist

From Clue 1, 2, and 3:
- The root beer lover must be in House 3 (since it is the only house to the right of the first and second houses).

From Clue 4:
- The cellist and the person with a gameboy are separated by one house. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the cellist must be in House 3.

Thus, the cellist lives in House 3.

\(\boxed{C}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
15. **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.

17. **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.
19. **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis.

Now, let's use the clues to deduce the positions of other characteristics:

- **Clue 9:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in the fifth house, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the fifth house, but we already know the fifth house is occupied by the tennis player and the person eating kiwis. Therefore, the person who only drinks water must be in the sixth house, but since there are only five houses, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate the placement of the tea drinker and the person who only drinks water.

Given the contradictions, let's re-evaluate the clues and placements:

- **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing running shoes is in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals is in the third house, and the person eating a banana is in the fourth house.
- The person eating oranges is in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
- **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Therefore, the cricketer is in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Therefore, the person wearing high heels is in the fourth or fifth house.
- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
- **Clue 4:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
- **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
- **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 19:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

Given the constraints, the person who likes green must be in the first house, as the person wearing boots must be to the right of the person who likes green, and the only remaining house for the person wearing boots is the second house.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in the first house.

The answer is: **(D) 1**."

"The correct answer is (A) 5.

Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house (which contradicts the first clue, but we'll assume the person who only drinks water is the same as the person who ate grilled cheese).
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2 and 4**: The swimmer and the person with the bouquet of daffodils are next to each other, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is to the right of the person eating oranges. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in house 3, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **Combining Clues 2 and 4**: The only possible arrangement is:
   - House 1: Swimmer
   - House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
   - House 3: Person eating oranges

3. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Given the arrangement from Clue 2 and 4, the soccer player must be in house 1.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person eating oranges is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the soccer player is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3.

### Assigning Sports and Fruits:
- House 1: Soccer player (eating mangos, with vase of tulips)
- House 2: Swimmer (eating bananas, with bouquet of daffodils)

7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the known information:
- From clue 2, the mystery book reader lives in the second house.
- From clue 4, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house.
- From clue 5, the percussionist must be in the first house, and the computer must be in the second house.
- From clue 1, the bird keeper cannot be in the first house, so the bird keeper must be in the second house.
- From clue 6, the fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house, so the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.
- From clue 7, the gameboy must be in the first house, and the rose bouquet must be in the second house.
- From clue 8, the cellist cannot be in the third house, so the cellist must be in the first house.

Now, let's summarize the current arrangement:
- **House 1**: Gameboy, History book buff, Rose bouquet, Flutist, Fish enthusiast
- **House 2**: Computer, Mystery book reader, Bouquet of lilies, Bird keeper, Percussionist
- **House 3**: Phone, Romance book lover, Carnations arrangement, Cellist

This arrangement fits all the given clues. Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in **House 1**.

The answer is: **(A) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and placing the known elements step by step.

1. **Clue 8**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 10**: There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
4. **Clue 11**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
7. **Clue 14**: The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Person with bouquet of lilies

From Clue 9, we know:
- House 2 or 3: Radio
- House 3 or 4: Carnations

From Clue 10, we know:
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Carnations

From Clue 11, we know:
- House 1: Not daffodils

From Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 3: Orange

From Clue 13, we know:
- House 1: Apple
- House 3: Orange
- House 3: Not banana
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 1: Banana

From Clue 14, we know:
- House 5: Not computer

Now, we can summarize the current placements:
- House 1: Apple
- House 2: Radio and Banana
- House 3: Orange
- House 4: Cat lover
- House 5: Person with bouquet of lilies

We need to place the remaining fruits, pets, and devices. From the remaining clues, we can deduce:
- The horse owner is in House 3 (Clue 5).
- The fish enthusiast is in House 1 (Clue 1).
- The person with the phone is in House 2 (Clue 3 and Clue 10).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the people in the houses, let's deduce the correct arrangement:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the person in house 1 drives a convertible, and the person in house 2 is a history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person in house 2 is wearing boots.

From these deductions:
- House 1: The person who drives a convertible.
- House 2: The person who is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Since the person in house 2 is the history book buff and is wearing boots, the person in house 1 must be the mystery book reader and is wearing sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place each person in their respective house based on their book preference and sport.

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
2. The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the golfer in the first house:

1. Golfer - House 1

Next, we use Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in House 1, and the mystery book reader cannot be in House 4. The only possible positions are:
- House 2: Mystery book reader, House 3: History book buff
- House 3: Mystery book reader, House 4: History book buff

Now, we use Clue 1: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover cannot be in House 1, and the swimmer cannot be in House 4. The only possible positions are:
- House 2: Swimmer, House 3: Romance book lover
- House 3: Swimmer, House 4: Romance book lover

Since the swimmer cannot be in House 3 (Clue 4), the swimmer must be in House 2, and the romance book lover must be in House 3.

Finally, we use Clue 5: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house. Since the only remaining house for the basketball player is House 4, the basketball player must be in House 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Golfer
2. Swimmer
3. Romance book lover
4. Basketball player

The basketball player lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house, as per Clue 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 3"
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we can establish the following sequence:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: (Unknown)

From clue 1, we know that the person who likes green is in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy is in House 2. This fits with the sequence from clue 2.

Now, we need to determine the favorite color of the person in House 3. According to clue 3, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the person in House 2 has a computer, the person in House 3 cannot like yellow. Therefore, the person in House 3 must like either green or blue.

Since the person in House 1 likes green, the person in House 3 must like blue.

So, we have:
- House 1: Green (person with a gameboy)
- House 2: Yellow (person with a computer)
- House 3: Blue (person with a phone)

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To determine the house number where the coffee drinker lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes red (root beer lover) is in house 3.

From clue 5, the root beer lover is in house 3, so the person who likes red is in house 3.

From clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the romance book lover to the left.

From clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1.

From clue 3, the history book buff does not live in the fourth house, which is consistent with the placement of the history book buff in house 1.

From clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house, so the tea drinker must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is occupied by the history book buff and house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

From clue 6, the mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1, 2, or 3. Since house 1 is occupied by the history book buff, house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover, and house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, the mystery book reader must be in house 1, which is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the consecutive placement.

Re-evaluating the consecutive placement:
- If the romance book lover is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1.
- From clue 2, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the person who likes green.
- From clue 1, there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. If the white person is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4. If the white person is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 (but house 1 is occupied by the history book buff). If the white person is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (but house 2 is occupied by the romance book lover).

Thus, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Root beer lover (red)
- House 4: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

The answer is: (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio, or vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person in house 2 is a fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 2 had pizza.

From Clue 1, we know that the person in house 1 likes green and the person in house 2 has a radio. Since the fish enthusiast lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person in house 2 cannot have a radio (since the person in house 2 has a fish and likes yellow, as we will deduce).

Therefore, the person in house 1 must have a radio, and the person in house 2 must like green.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: Radio, Green, Fantasy book enthusiast, Pizza
- House 2: Fish, Yellow, Cat lover, Spaghetti

Thus, the cat lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the third or fifth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
5. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
9. The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
10. The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
11. There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
12. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
13. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
14. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
15. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
16. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
17. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we can start placing the known information:

- The dog owner (2nd house) and the person who likes red (3rd house) are next to each other.
- The person who likes milk (1st house) and the person who likes blue (2nd house) are next to each other.
- The person who ate spaghetti (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who likes red (3rd house).
- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice (4th or 5th house).
- The bird keeper (1st or 2nd house) and the fish enthusiast (3rd or 4th house) are one house apart.
- The root beer lover (2nd or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are next to each other.
- The fantasy book enthusiast (3rd or 4th house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are next to each other.
- The person who owns horses (1st or 2nd house) and the person who had pizza (4th or 5th house) are two houses apart.
- The person who likes yellow (1st or 3rd house) and the romance book lover (3rd or 4th house) are two houses apart.

By process of elimination and logical placement, we can determine:

- The person who only drinks water lives in the 4th house.

Thus, the correct answer is:
**(E) 4**"
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who is eating kiwis.

1. The flutist lives in the first house (Clue 5).
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house (Clue 8).
3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist (Clue 1). Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the cellist in the third house.
4. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist (Clue 2). Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second house.
5. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives (Clue 3). Given the positions of the flutist, fish enthusiast, and guitarist, the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, and the person who is eating oranges in the fourth house.
6. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other (Clue 10). Since the fish enthusiast is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the third house.
7. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (Clue 11). This is consistent with the previous deduction.
8. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis (Clue 12). Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who owns horses, so the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
9. The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other (Clue 4). Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
10. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house (Clue 6) and does not live in the third house (Clue 7), which is consistent.
11. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper (Clue 9). Since the bird keeper cannot be in the first house (where the flutist lives) or the third house (where the person who likes milk lives), the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the tea drinker in the fourth house.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis, flutist
- House 2: Person eating oranges, guitarist, fish enthusiast
- House 3: Person owning horses, person who likes milk
- House 4: Person drinking water, bird keeper, tea drinker

The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"To determine the house where the person who had stew lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.

9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

From Clue 1 and Clue 8, we know the person with a rose bouquet and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with a vase of tulips is next to the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 6, the person who had pizza is directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese is to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. From Clue 2, the person who is eating oranges is to the left of the person who is eating apples. From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating kiwis. From Clue 10, the person who is eating oranges is to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 11, the person who is eating apples is directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, Stew
- House 2: Kiwis, Grilled cheese, Tulips
- House 3: Oranges, Rose bouquet, Spaghetti
- House 4: Apples, Served pizza
- House 5: Mangos, Served fried rice

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, pets, and flowers. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in house 2. If the dog owner is in house 4, the person with tulips must be in house 3, and so on.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person with daffodils can only live in house 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the horse owner is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4, and so on.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 1, the lilies must be in house 2, 3, or 4. If the horse owner is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3 or 4, and so on.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover is in house 1.

Let's start placing the cat lover and use the other clues to fill in the rest:

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 3:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 1, the tulips must be in house 2 if the dog owner is in house 3, or in house 3 if the dog owner is in house 4. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the tulips cannot be in house 1. Let's assume the dog owner is in house 3, so the tulips must be in house 2.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** (Not tulips, not daffodils, not lilies, not carnations)

From Clue 2, the daffodils cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1, 3, or 4. Since house 1 is the cat lover and house 3 is the dog owner, the daffodils must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils

From Clue 3, there is one house between the horse owner and the carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horse owner must be in house 1 or 2 (since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils). If the horse owner is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3, but the dog owner is already in house 3. Therefore, the horse owner must be in house 2, and the carnations must be in house 4.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

From Clue 4, the lilies must be to the right of the horse owner, so they must be in house 3 or 4. Since house 3 is the dog owner and house 4 is the daffodils, the lilies must be in house 3.

- **House 1:** Cat lover
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

The only pet left is the fish enthusiast, and the only house left is house 1.

- **House 1:** Cat lover (fish enthusiast)
- **House 2:** Tulips (horse owner)
- **House 3:** Dog owner (lilies)
- **House 4:** Daffodils (carnations)

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house has a phone.

From clue 2, we know:
- The person wearing boots lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with horses and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses. Since the first house has a phone, the second house must have the radio, and the first house must have the horses.

So, the distribution is:
- First house: Phone and Horses
- Second house: Boots and Radio

The only characteristic left for the second house is high heels.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their sport and pet.

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the baseball player in the second house:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

From clue 1, the basketball player cannot be in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player must be to the left of the swimmer. Since the baseball player is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

From clue 3, the baseball player is in the second house, so the swimmer must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are the third and fourth, but the third house is already occupied by the swimmer, so the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house and the dog owner must be in the third house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

From clue 5, the bird keeper cannot be in the first house. From clue 7, the bird keeper cannot be in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house:

- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. The only remaining house for the tennis player is the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the tennis player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the second house:

- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 4: Fish enthusiast

Thus, the bird keeper lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

### Clues Analysis:

1. **The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.**
   - This means the person with a computer cannot be in house 3, and the person who likes white must be in house 2 or 3.

2. **There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.**
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is exactly one house between them.

3. **The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses.

4. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.**
   - This means the SUV cannot be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2 or 3.

5. **The violinist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the violinist lives in house 2 or 3.

6. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses.

7. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.**
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 7, the person who likes white cannot be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who likes white is to the left of the guitarist, the person who likes white must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the sedan and SUV are in consecutive houses. Since the SUV cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the sedan and gameboy are in consecutive houses. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house between them. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 or 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in house 3, and the baseball player must be in house 1.
- From Clue 5, the violinist does not live in the first house, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. Since the guitarist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, the swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 3.

### Conclusion:

- House 1: Baseball player, owns a sedan, has a computer.
- House 2: Violinist, owns a gameboy, likes white.
- House 3: Swimmer, owns an SUV, likes blue.

The soccer player is not mentioned in the clues, but based on the process of elimination, the soccer player must be in house 1, as the other characteristics are assigned to the other houses.

Therefore, the number of the house where the soccer player lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their musical instruments, shoes, fruits, and devices. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The pianist does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in either house 2 or 3.

2. **The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.**
   - This means the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2, and the person eating oranges must live in house 2 or 3.

3. **The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pianist and the person wearing high heels must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.**
   - This means the person wearing boots must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating kiwis must live in house 1 or 2.

6. **The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.**
   - This means the person with a radio must live in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing high heels must live in house 2 or 3.

7. **The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.**
   - This means the person with a television must live in house 2 or 3, and the person eating oranges must live in house 1 or 2.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other, and the percussionist and the person wearing running shoes next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's consider the possible positions:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- If the pianist is in house 3, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Assume the pianist is in house 2 and the person wearing high heels is in house 3. This means the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively, or vice versa.

Now, consider the person eating kiwis and the person wearing boots. The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2, and the person wearing boots must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person wearing high heels is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. Now, the person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television).

So, we have:
- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: High heels

Now, we need to place the devices. The person with a radio must be in house 1 or 2, and the person with a television must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person with a television is directly right of the person eating oranges, the person with a television must be in house 3.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Kiwis, wearing boots
- House 2: Oranges, wearing running shoes
- House 3: High heels, television

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. **Clue 13:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7:
- The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other (Clue 4), the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or fourth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the first and fifth houses or the second and fourth houses. Given the other constraints, the root beer lover must live in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth or fifth house. Given the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red must live in the first, second, or fourth house, and the person who drives a convertible must live in the first, second, or third house, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first or second house. Given the other constraints, the person who drives a convertible must live in the first house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green must live in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the third house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the constraints and clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who owns an SUV.

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 5:
- House 1: Kiwis

From clue 4, since the person in house 1 is eating kiwis, the person in house 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person in house 2 must be eating mangos.

From clue 3, since the person who drives a truck does not live in the first house, the person in house 2 must be driving a truck.

From clue 1, since the person who drives a truck does not live in the third house, and we already know the person in house 2 drives a truck, the person in house 3 must own an SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3 -> Fried Rice

2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, House 2 must have spaghetti.
   - House 2 -> Spaghetti

3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
   - House 1 -> Swimmer

4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.
   - Since House 3 has fried rice, the cricketer cannot live there.
   - The cricketer must live in either House 1 or House 2.
   - House 1 is already occupied by the swimmer, so the cricketer must live in House 2.
   - House 2 -> Cricketer

Now, we have:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Fried Rice

The only sport left for House 1 is tennis, and the only sport left for House 3 is swimming, but since House 1 is already the swimmer, House 3 must be the tennis player.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Cricketer (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Tennis Player (and Fried Rice)

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

9. **Clue 7:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
- The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

Next, we use Clue 2 and Clue 3 to place the person who drives a truck and the person who is wearing sandals:

- The person who drives a truck cannot live in the fourth house.
- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

This means the person who drives a truck must live in either the first, second, or third house, and the person who is wearing sandals must live in the house immediately to the right of the truck owner.

Using Clue 10:

- There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.

This means the person who likes green must live in the house immediately to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Now, using Clue 1 and Clue 5:

- There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

This means the person who drives a minivan must live in the house immediately to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

Using Clue 4 and Clue 7:

- The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

We can start placing the remaining characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives in the third house (since the person who is wearing sandals must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (since the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house).
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (since the person who likes red must be in the second house).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house).
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the second house (since the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house).
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house (since the person who drives a truck must be in the third house).
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (since the person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house, and the first house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is wearing loafers).

Finally, we can determine the house where the person who is wearing boots lives:

- The person who is wearing boots must be in the first house (since the first house is the only one left).

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 2).
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who had stew lives (Clue 1). Since the history book buff lives in the first house, the person who had stew must live in the third house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house (Clue 4).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Person who had stew

The correct answer to the question ""What is the number of the house where the history book buff lives?"" is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and use a process of elimination and logical deduction to find the answer.

1. The soccer player lives in the first house.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
3. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
4. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
5. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

15. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
16. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the fourth house.
17. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

From these clues, we can start placing the characteristics:

- House 1: Soccer player (clue 1)
- House 3: Kiwi eater (clue 13)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (right of swimmer, clue 2)
- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)

Since House 4 is the fantasy book enthusiast, the swimmer must be in House 3 (since House 4 is fantasy book enthusiast and House 5 cannot be apples).

- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Not apples (clue 3)
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)

Since House 5 cannot be apples, and we have to place the remaining characteristics:

- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)
- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)
- House 5: Not apples (clue 3)

The only remaining option for House 5 is the person who ate stew.

- House 5: Stew eater

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Not apples (clue 3)
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 5: Stew eater

The remaining characteristics are:

- House 1: Soccer player
- House 2: Not apples (clue 3)
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 5: Stew eater

The only remaining option for House 2 is the person who ate apples.

- House 2: Apples eater

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is:

\(\boxed{D}\)"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Let's start by organizing the information:

- **House 1:**
  - Not yellow (Clue 2)
  - Not daffodils (Clue 7)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)
- **House 2:**
  - History book buff (Clue 3)
  - Daffodils (Clue 7)
- **House 3:**
  - Loafers (Clue 6)
  - Not yellow (Clue 4)
  - Not blue (Clue 1, because the person who likes blue is to the right of the person who is wearing high heels)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 or House 3.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in House 1 or House 3 (Clue 2 and Clue 4), the person who likes yellow must be in House 2. This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 3. But since the person who is wearing loafers is in House 3 (Clue 6), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Boots, not yellow, not daffodils, not blue, not lilies (must be science fiction book fanatic and green)
- House 2: Daffodils, yellow, history book buff
- House 3: Loafers, not yellow, not blue, not daffodils, must be lilies (must be romance book lover and green)

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1 and the lilies are in House 3, this is consistent.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, so the person in house 2 drives a minivan, and the person in house 3 is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible, so the person in house 4 is wearing sandals, and the person in house 5 drives a convertible.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other, so the person in house 2 must be wearing boots.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From these deductions, we can summarize the information as follows:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots, minivan
- House 3: High heels
- House 4: Sandals, SUV
- House 5: Convertible

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Since the cricketer is in House 1, the person who owns horses must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3.
3. **Clue 3:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
   - The cat lover must be in House 3, as the sedan is in House 3 and the cat lover must be to the right of the sedan owner.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - Since the cat lover is in House 3, the basketball player cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the basketball player must be in House 1 or House 2.
   - If the basketball player were in House 1, the soccer player would be in House 2, and the truck driver would be in House 3. This would place the cat lover in House 3, which is correct.

Thus, the basketball player lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by listing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

17. The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
18. The percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.
19. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

From Clue 4, we know the radio is in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house, and the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. Let's consider the possible positions for the bouquet of daffodils and the vase of tulips.

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, the vase of tulips must be in the second, third, or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips cannot be in the fourth house. So, the vase of tulips would be in the second or third house.

If the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the vase of tulips would be in the third or fourth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the vase of tulips would be in the third house.

Now, from Clue 8, the person with the rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house. This leaves the vase of tulips in the third house.

From Clue 14, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in the first or second house, and the person with the gameboy must be in the third or fourth house. Since the rose bouquet is in the first house and the bouquet of daffodils is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies must be in the first house, and the gameboy must be in the third house.

From Clue 6, the person with the television cannot be in the second house, so the television must be in the first, third, or fifth house. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the television must be in the first or fifth house. If the television is in the first house, the person with the television would be in the first house, the radio in the fourth house, the bouquet of daffodils in the second house, the vase of tulips in the third house, and the gameboy in the fourth house. This is not possible because the radio is in the fourth house. So, the television must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live next to each other. Since the television is in the fifth house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth and fifth houses. Since the radio is in the fourth house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fifth house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 11, the bird keeper must be in the fifth house, and the person who drives a convertible must be in the fourth house. This is consistent with the previous deductions.

From Clue 13, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the person who owns horses must be in the fifth house. This is consistent with the previous deductions.

From Clue 17, the pianist must be in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house. This is consistent with the previous deductions.

From Clue 18, the percussionist must be in the second house, and the cat lover must be in the third house. This is consistent with the previous deductions.

So, the vase of tulips is in the third house.

The answer is \boxed{3}."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
- **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest:

- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the person wearing loafers must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house.
- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first or second house. But the second house is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes, so the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second and third houses, but the second house is already occupied by the person wearing high heels. Therefore, the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice must be in the first and second houses. Since the first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the person who ate fried rice must be in the first house, and the root beer lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the root beer lover is in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house.
- **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives. Since the person who owns an SUV is in the third house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the third house.
- **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second, third, or fourth house. But the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels, the third house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Now, we can summarize the information:

1. House 1: Person wearing running shoes, owns a sedan, ate stew, drinks coffee.
2. House 2: Person wearing high heels, root beer lover, owns an SUV, ate fried rice.
3. House 3: Person wearing loafers, owns a convertible, ate grilled cheese, drinks milk.
4. House 4: Person wearing boots, ate spaghetti, drinks water.

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 1.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."

   - Since the person who had pizza is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

5. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4, this is consistent.

7. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 2 (saxophonist).

8. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the flutist must be in house 1, 2, or 3. But house 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the flutist must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4 (tea drinker).

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues to deduce the correct arrangement:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
   - This means these two people are in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the swimmer and the sedan owner are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the truck driver and the carnations arrangement are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player is in a house to the left of the lilies.

6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the tennis player is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
   - This means the swimmer is in houses 2, 3, or 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the minivan is in house 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
    - This means the root beer lover is in house 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From Clue 9, the minivan is in house 4.
- From Clue 10, the root beer lover is in house 3.

Since the minivan is in house 4 and the root beer lover is in house 3, we can start filling in the other clues:

- From Clue 8, the basketball player and the truck driver are in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since the minivan is in house 4, the basketball player and the truck driver must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the lilies are to the right of the basketball player. So, the basketball player must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the daffodils and lilies are next to each other, so the daffodils must be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player are in houses 2 and 4 or 3 and 1. Since the lilies are in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the tennis player in house 3.
- From Clue 6, the tennis player is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in house 4.
- From Clue 3, the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.
- From Clue 7, the swimmer is not in house 1, so the swimmer is in house 2, and the sedan owner in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Basketball player, daffodils
- House 2: Swimmer, sedan
- House 3: Tennis player, tea drinker, carnations
- House 4: Coffee drinker, root beer lover, minivan

The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, their favorite drinks, cars, book preferences, and the fruits they are eating.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan cannot be in House 1.

3. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.**
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3, and the person driving a convertible cannot be in House 1.

4. **There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 3, or Houses 2 and 3, or Houses 1 and 2, but not in Houses 1 and 3 (since there would be no house in between).

5. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in House 1 or House 3.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in House 1 and see how the other clues fit:

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: ?**

From clue 5, the person eating oranges cannot be in House 2, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker**
- **House 2: ?**
- **House 3: Oranges**

From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2, or Houses 2 and 3, but not in Houses 1 and 3. Since the tea drinker is in House 1 and the person eating oranges is in House 3, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in Houses 1 and 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the coffee drinker is in House 2, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 2. The only remaining option for the science fiction book fanatic is House 3.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person eating oranges is in House 3, the person eating apples must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

From clue 3, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 3, the person driving a convertible must be in House 2.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

The only car left is the minivan, which must be in House 1.

- **House 1: Tea drinker (Fantasy book enthusiast, Minivan)**
- **House 2: Coffee drinker (Apples, Convertible)**
- **House 3: Oranges (Science fiction book fanatic)**

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the correct house for the fantasy book enthusiast step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 4, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From clue 1, since the person who likes red lives in the second house, the mystery book reader must live in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Mystery

From clue 2, the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either the second or the third house. But since the second house is already occupied by the person who likes red, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the third house. Since the third house is the mystery book reader, the person who likes white must live in the first or second house. But the first house is the fantasy book enthusiast, so the person who likes white must live in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Fantasy
- House 2: White
- House 3: Mystery

This satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the person with a radio is in house 1 or 2, and the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2 or 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with a rose bouquet is in house 2, which is the tea drinker.

Now, let's summarize what we know:

- House 2: Tea drinker, Rose bouquet
- House 3: Guitarist

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the kiwi eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the flutist must be in house 1, and the banana eater must be in house 3.

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person with a radio must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio, Tulips, Flutist, Coffee drinker

- House 3: Television, Guitarist, Kiwi eater

From the remaining characteristics:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Radio, Tulips

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in House 3.
2. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Therefore, the banana eater must be in House 4.

4. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the person eating apples must be in House 2, and the person wearing running shoes must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing running shoes is in House 1, the person eating mangos must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

From the above deductions:
- The flutist lives in the first house.
- The person who likes white lives in the second house.
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.

Since the flutist and the person wearing loafers both live in the first house, the flutist is wearing loafers.

The person in the second house is not wearing loafers, so they must be wearing sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by summarizing the clues and deducing the arrangement step by step.

1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

Let's start by placing the root beer lover in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Now, we use Clue 1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other. Since the only person in the second house is the one who only drinks water, the person who drives a minivan must live in the first house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover

Next, we use Clue 2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house, and the person who is eating mangos must be in the second or third house. But the second house is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, so the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Now, we use Clue 5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the first house is occupied by the person who drives a minivan and owns a sedan, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the second house.

- House 1: Drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos

Next, we use Clue 6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water and has a bouquet of daffodils, the cellist must be in the first house, and the saxophonist must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Now, we use Clue 7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house. But the first house is occupied by the cellist, so the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist

Finally, we use Clue 8 and Clue 9. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the first house is occupied by the cellist and owns a sedan, the person who is eating apples must be in the second house, and the violinist must be in the third house.

- House 1: Cellist, drives a minivan, owns a sedan
- House 2: Only drinks water, has a bouquet of daffodils, cellist, has carnations, eating apples
- House 3: Root beer lover, eating mangos, saxophonist, violinist

Thus, the violinist lives in House 3. The answer is:

(C) 3"

- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Blue
- House 5: Grilled cheese

Next, using Clue 5 and 19:
- The person who likes red must be in House 1, 2, or 4 (since it cannot be in House 5).
- The person who had stew must be in House 4 or 5 (since it must be to the right of the person who likes white, and white cannot be in House 5).

From Clue 3, the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone:

"Given the clues:
1. The person with a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person with a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we deduce that the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person with the television lives in the first house.

Since the person with the television is in the first house, the person with the computer must be in the second house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(A) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the people, their lunch, flowers, book preferences, sports, and musical instruments.

### Clues Recap:
1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 1: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.**
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house 1, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2: The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the pizza eater and the history book buff must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 1.

3. **Clue 3: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:

Let's consider the possible arrangements based on the clues:

- **Case 1: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 1 and 2**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, then the golfer must be in house 1 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 2).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2, which contradicts the fact that the history book buff is in house 2. Therefore, this case is invalid.

- **Case 2: Pizza Eater and History Book Buff in Houses 2 and 1**
  - If the pizza eater is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 1, then the golfer must be in house 2 (since the science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the golfer, and the golfer cannot be in house 1).
  - This would mean the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1, which is consistent with the clues.

### Valid Arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff, science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: Pizza eater, golfer

Now, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 2 (since the guitarist is to the right of them).

### Assigning Remaining Characteristics:
- **House 1:**
  - History book buff
  - Science fiction book fanatic
  - Must have a bouquet of daffodils (since the guitarist is to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:**
  - Pizza eater
  - Golfer
  - Must have a vase of tulips (since the bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)

- **Musical Instruments:**
  - The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in house 1)
  - The percussionist must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 2)

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(B) 1**"

"Given the clues and the characteristics of the people in the houses, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, House 1 has a bouquet of lilies.

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in the second house (House 2).

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the person with a radio lives in House 2, and the person eating apples lives in House 1.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the person with a radio lives in House 2, the violinist must live in House 1.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the violinist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the individuals in the correct houses based on their sports and lunch choices.

1. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - Tennis player: House 3

2. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.**
   - Grilled cheese: House 5

3. **The golfer lives in the fourth house.**
   - Golfer: House 4

4. **There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.**
   - Possible pairs: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5). Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only valid pair is (1, 3) or (2, 4). Given House 3 is taken, the pair must be (1, 3).

5. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.**
   - Pizza: Left of Cricketer

6. **The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Stew: Left of Spaghetti

7. **The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.**
   - Soccer player: Right of Tennis player (so, Soccer player: House 4 or 5, but since Tennis player is in House 3, Soccer player must be in House 5).

From clue 7, the soccer player is in House 5, and the grilled cheese is in House 4. This leaves us with:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 4, the fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 3. Since House 3 is taken by the tennis player, the only valid pair is (1, 3) with stew in House 1 and spaghetti in House 3.

From clue 6, stew is left of spaghetti, so:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

From clue 5, pizza is left of the cricketer. The only house left for pizza is House 2, and the only house left for the cricketer is House 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Stew, Cricketer
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Soccer player

Therefore, the cricketer lives in House 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, and vice versa.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
   - This is consistent with Clue 3, so the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti must live in houses 1 and 2, in that order or in reverse order.

From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in house 2. Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in house 1.

Based on the clues, the arrangement is:
- House 1: The person who likes white, drinks water, and is a swimmer.
- House 2: The person who ate spaghetti, drinks milk, and is a baseball player.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step-by-step:

1. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house. Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either the first or the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house.
3. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must live in either the first or the third house.
4. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means the coffee drinker cannot be in the third house (since there would be no house to the right for the mango eater).

### Deduction:

- If the root beer lover is in the first house, the water drinker must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. However, this would place the mango eater in the second house, which contradicts Clue 4 (the person eating oranges does not live in the second house). Therefore, the root beer lover cannot be in the first house.

- If the root beer lover is in the third house, the water drinker must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the coffee drinker and the mango eater. The coffee drinker must be to the left of the mango eater, which is consistent with Clue 1. The person eating oranges must be in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 4.

### Conclusion:

The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step-by-step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or third house. Since the first house is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate fried rice must live in the third house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti and the second house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the third house.

- House 4: Banana.
- House 5: Grilled cheese and Kiwis (since the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fifth house, and the person who ate Kiwis does not live in the first house).

Using the clues about the gameboy and truck, we can place:

- House 2: Truck and Gameboy.
- House 1: Minivan and Stew (since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy, and the person who ate stew does not live in the first house).

Now, using the information about the radio and oranges:

- House 3: Radio and Oranges (since the person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan, and the person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese).

Finally, using the information about the pizza and grapes:

- House 2: Gameboy and Oranges.
- House 3: Radio and Pizza.
- House 4: Banana and Grapes.

From the above, we can deduce that the mystery book reader lives in House 1.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by placing the cellist in the first house as per Clue 4:

- **House 1:** Cellist

Next, we use Clue 5, which states that the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the cellist is in House 1, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the basketball player is in House 2, the person who likes red must be in House 3 or 4.
- If the basketball player is in House 3, the person who likes red must be in House 4.

We will try the basketball player in House 3 and the person who likes red in House 4:

- **House 2:** Running shoes (from Clue 8, the basketball player lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes)
- **House 3:** Basketball player
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Now, we use Clue 7, which states that the flutist lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the basketball player is in House 3, the flutist cannot be in House 3. Let's consider the possibilities:

- If the flutist is in House 1, the person who likes yellow must be in House 2.
- If the flutist is in House 2, the person who likes yellow must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 1 and the person who likes yellow in House 2:

- **House 1:** Flutist
- **House 2:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 3:** Basketball player
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Next, we use Clue 9, which states that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the basketball player, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 2 and the person who likes yellow in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Now, we use Clue 6, which states that the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the flutist is in House 2, the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1:

- **House 1:** Person who is wearing boots
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Next, we use Clue 10, which states that the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. Since the flutist is in House 2, the cricketer must be in House 1:

- **House 1:** Cricketer
- **House 2:** Flutist
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Person who likes red

Now, we use Clue 11, which states that the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 4 (but House 4 is the person who likes red, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 3 and the person who likes yellow in House 4:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Person who likes yellow

Now, we use Clue 12, which states that the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who only drinks water must be in House 2:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Person who likes yellow

Finally, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The golfer does not live in the fourth house (Clue 1).
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house (Clue 2).
- The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3).

Since the flutist is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1 (but House 1 is the cellist, so this is not possible).

Let's try the flutist in House 4 and the person who likes yellow in House 3:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Cricketer
- **House 3:** Person who likes yellow
- **House 4:** Flutist

Now, we use Clue 11, which states that the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the flutist is in House 4, the person who likes blue must be in House 3 (but House 3 is the person who likes yellow, so this is not possible).

Finally, the correct placement is:

- **House 1:** Cellist
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water
- **House 3:** Flutist
- **House 4:** Person who likes yellow

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in House 2.

"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.

5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From clues 1 and 7, we know that the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes both live in the first house.

Using clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live next to each other. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes red and the person who is eating grapes, the grilled cheese and white preferences must be in the second and third houses.

Clue 6 tells us that the person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer must live in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

Clue 5 states that the soccer player lives to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the cricketer is in the third house, the soccer player must be in the third house, and the person who is eating apples must be in the second house.

Clue 2 tells us that the person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating apples and the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

Clue 4 indicates that there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer is in the third house, the person who has a radio must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Red, Grapes, Radio, Pizza
- House 2: White, Apples, Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Yellow, Soccer, Computer

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is:

(C) 1"

From Clue 18, the tennis player is in House 2 or 3. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the tennis player must be in House 2.

From Clue 14, the bird keeper does not live in the fourth house, so the bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Since House 1 is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the bird keeper must be in House 2 or 5. From Clue 15, the computer owner is not in the first house, so the computer owner must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since House 2 is occupied by the tennis player, the computer owner must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since House 3 is occupied by the person wearing boots, the computer owner must be in House 4 or 5. Since House 4 is occupied by the swimmer, the computer owner must be in House 5.

From Clue 16, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the computer owner is in House 5, the person who has a phone must be in House 4 and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 5. This means the person who has a radio must be in House 3 (since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is to the left of the person who has a phone).

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 2. This is consistent with the other clues.

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the person who is wearing loafers must be in House 1 and the person who owns horses must be in House 2. This is consistent with the other clues.

From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the dog owner is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1 and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

From Clue 10, the person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone is in House 4 and the person who has a radio is in House 3, this is consistent.

From Clue 19, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is \boxed{3}."

From clue 3, the tennis player and the apple eater live next to each other. Given the bird keeper is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the tennis player must be in the second house and the apple eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Kiwi eater, Apple eater, Bird keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Tennis player, Science fiction book fanatic, Dog owner, High heels

10. **Clue 7**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
    - The cricketer must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

11. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
    - The person eating oranges must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating mangos must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

12. **Clue 6**: There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 3, 4, or 5.

13. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
    - House 2: Oranges

14. **Clue 11**: The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
    - The bird keeper must be in House 3, 4, or 5, and the person eating apples must be in House 1, 2, or 3.

15. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - The dog owner and the person eating kiwis must be in Houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Not fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 2: Swimmer, cat lover, oranges.
- House 3: Fish, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 4: Grilled cheese, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.
- House 5: Pizza, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Given the constraints, the only remaining options for House 1 are:
- House 1: Fried rice, not cat lover, not fish enthusiast, not basketball player, not tennis player, not cricketer, not dog owner, not kiwis.

Thus, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in their respective houses based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the information and using the clues step by step.

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means if the person who had pizza is in House 2, the person who likes blue is in House 3.

3. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 3 or 4 if red is in House 4.

4. **The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.**
   - House 4: Fried Rice

5. **The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 3.

6. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.**
   - This means if the person who is eating mangos is in House 2, the person who likes red is in House 3.

7. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means if the person who drives a truck is in House 2, the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 3.

8. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means the minivan cannot be in House 3 or 4 if spaghetti is in House 4.

9. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - This is consistent with Clue 6.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
    - This means if red is in House 2, grapes cannot be in House 1.

11. **The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, the rose bouquet is in House 1 or 3.

12. **The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if blue is in House 2, the SUV is in House 1 or 3.

13. **The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
    - This means if pizza is in House 2, apples are in House 1 or 3.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- House 1: Green
- House 4: Fried Rice

From Clue 2, if pizza is in House 2, blue must be in House 3. If pizza is in House 3, blue must be in House 4, but House 4 is already occupied by Fried Rice. Therefore, pizza must be in House 2, and blue must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, if mangos are in House 1, red must be in House 2, but pizza is in House 2. Therefore, mangos must be in House 2, and red must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, if truck is in House 2, lilies must be in House 3. But red is in House 3, so truck cannot be in House 2. Therefore, truck must be in House 1, and lilies must be in House 2.

From Clue 11, if pizza is in House 2, rose bouquet must be in House 1. Therefore, rose bouquet is in House 1.

From Clue 12, if blue is in House 3, SUV must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so blue must be in House 4, and SUV must be in House 3.

From Clue 8, if minivan is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2. But pizza is in House 2, so minivan cannot be in House 1. Therefore, minivan must be in House 3, and spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 10, if red is in House 3, grapes must be in House 4. But blue is in House 4, so grapes must be in House 2.

From Clue 9, if mangos are in House 2, apples must be in House 1. But rose bouquet is in House 1, so apples must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person in the first house must be the cricketer.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person in the second house drives a convertible, the person in the first house must drive a minivan.

From the above deductions:
- The person in the first house is a cricketer and drives a minivan.
- The person in the second house is a baseball player and drives a convertible.

Since the person in the second house is eating grapes (from clue 1), the person in the first house must be eating mangos.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who is eating kiwis must live in House 3.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in House 2, the person who likes green cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 2, or the person eating apples must be in House 2 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3. However, since House 2 is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person eating apples must be in House 1 and the person eating oranges must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes white must be in House 3 because the person who likes green must be in House 1 (since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in House 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player must be in House 1.
- The mystery book reader must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1, as it is to the left of the mystery book reader.

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader

Now, using Clue 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 because they live to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1.

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Soccer player, gameboy, rose bouquet
- House 2: Mystery book reader, root beer

The person who has a rose bouquet lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of the houses, their occupants, and their pets and cars.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the fish enthusiast and the dog owner based on Clue 4:
- Fish enthusiast (F) lives in house 1.
- Dog owner (D) lives in house 2.

Using Clue 2, we know there are two houses between the truck owner (T) and the dog owner (D):
- T must be in house 4 (since D is in house 2, and there are two houses between them).

Next, using Clue 3, the truck owner (T) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S):
- Since T is in house 4, S must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Using Clue 1, the minivan owner (M) must be in house 3 or 4, but since house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, M must be in house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the truck owner, so M must be in house 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Now, using Clue 5, the cat lover (C) does not live in the second house:
- C cannot be in house 2.

Since we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (F)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

The only house left for the cat lover (C) is house 1, but house 1 is already occupied by the fish enthusiast. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions again.

Re-evaluating:
- House 1: Cat lover (C)
- House 2: Dog owner (D)
- House 3: Minivan owner (M)
- House 4: Truck owner (T)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house (Clue 5).
2. The root beer lover lives in the second house (Clue 3).
3. The person who likes yellow lives to the left of the person who likes milk (Clue 2). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk drinker must be in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 1). Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house. But the fourth house is already occupied by the milk drinker, so the blue person must be in the fourth house.
5. The person who likes white lives to the right of the person who only drinks water (Clue 4). Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the water drinker must be in the first house. Therefore, the white person must be in the second house.

Summarizing the positions:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: White
- House 3: Yellow
- House 4: Milk

The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Starting with Clue 6, we know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: ?

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes. This means the person who is eating grapes cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already occupied by the person who likes blue, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 1.

From Clue 3, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the person who is eating grapes is in House 1, the basketball player must be in House 1. This means the person who is eating oranges, who must be to the left of the cricketer (Clue 1), must be in House 3.

From Clue 2, the baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the cat lover must be in House 3.

From Clue 4, the dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since the cat lover is in House 3 and likes green, the dog owner must be in House 1.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 1, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 3.

Now we have:
- House 1: Basketball player, eating oranges, wearing boots, dog owner, likes white.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, wearing loafers, eating grapes, cat lover, likes green.
- House 3: Person who likes white, wearing sandals, eating mangos, cricketer, likes blue.

The bird keeper is the only one left, and they must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

   - This means the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 5.

7. **The guitarist does not live in the fifth house.**
   - Guitarist: Houses 1, 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in house 4 or 5, and the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

9. **The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker cannot be in house 5, and the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 1.

10. **The dog owner lives in the fourth house.**
    - Dog owner: House 4.

11. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.**
    - This means the cricketer cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 5.

12. **The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5.

13. **The cricketer lives in the fourth house.**
    - Cricketer: House 4.

14. **The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.**
    - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 5.

15. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.**
    - This means the swimmer cannot be in house 5, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 1.

16. **The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
    - This means the person who likes milk cannot be in house 1, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 5.

17. **The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
    - Coffee drinker: House 5, so the cellist must be in house 4.

18. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.**
    - This means the person who ate fried rice cannot be in house 5, and the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

- House 1: Horse owner
- House 2: Root beer lover
- House 3: Pianist
- House 4: Dog owner, Cricketer, Cellist
- House 5: Coffee drinker, Tennis player

From clue 14, the tennis player is in house 4, and the bird keeper is in house 5. From clue 17, the cellist is in house 4, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 4. Therefore, the cricketer must be in house 3, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4. From clue 11, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 3, and the cricketer is in house 4.

From clue 16, the root beer lover is in house 2, and the person who likes milk is in house 3. From clue 8, the guitarist is in house 3, and the root beer lover is in house 2.

From clue 12, the coffee drinker is in house 5, and the tennis player is in house 4.

From clue 15, the fish enthusiast is in house 5, and the swimmer is in house 3.

From clue 6, the pianist is in house 3, and the bird keeper is in house 5.

From clue 4, the flutist is in house 5, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 7, the guitarist is in house 3, and the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3.

From clue 9, the person who ate fried rice is in house 3, and the tea drinker is in house 2.

From clue 18, the person who had stew is in house 4, and the person who ate fried rice is in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

12. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the fifth house.

Given Clue 7, the person who likes blue lives in house 5. This significantly narrows down our options for the other houses.

From Clue 10, the romance book lover and the tennis player must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Since house 5 is occupied by the person who likes blue, they must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes green must be in houses 1, 3, and 5 or 2, 4, and 5. Given Clue 5, the person who is eating mangos cannot be in house 4, so they must be in houses 1, 2, or 3, and the person who likes green must be in houses 2, 3, or 4.

We can deduce the following:

- From Clue 1, the cellist lives in house 1 and the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.
- From Clue 2, since the dog owner cannot live in house 1, the dog owner must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct house number for each person based on their car and device.

1. The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone must be in House 2 and the SUV in House 4.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in House 3, the radio must be in House 4 (since House 4 is the only house to the right of House 3).

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The convertible cannot be in House 3, so it must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already taken by the minivan, so the convertible must be in House 2.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The computer cannot be in House 1, so it must be in House 2, House 3, or House 4. But House 2 and House 4 are already taken, so the computer must be in House 3.

Now, we can summarize the information:

- House 1: Minivan

From Clue 2, since the person with the phone is directly left of the person with the television, and House 2 is occupied by the computer, the only possible positions are:
- **House 1:** Phone
- **House 3:** Television

From Clue 1, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or 5 because the person with the phone is in House 1.

From Clue 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives to the right of the person with the radio. Since the person with the radio cannot be in House 4 or 5, the person with the radio must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 is occupied by the phone, and House 2 is occupied by the computer, so the person with the radio must be in House 3. This means:
- **House 3:** Radio

From Clue 5, the person with the bouquet of daffodils does not live in House 4, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 5. This means:
- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils

From Clue 7, the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person with the carnations arrangement. Since the person with the carnations arrangement cannot be in House 1, House 2, or House 5, the only possible positions are House 4 and House 5. But House 5 is occupied by the bouquet of daffodils, so the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 4, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 5.

- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast (Clue 1 and 5)
- **House 4:** Golfer (Clue 2)

From Clue 7, the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are next to each other. Since the cricketer is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 is already occupied by the bird keeper, so the person wearing loafers must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers

From Clue 8, there is one house between the bird keeper (House 1) and the person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person wearing loafers. This means the person wearing sandals must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Person wearing sandals

From Clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Therefore, the baseball player must be in House 5, but House 5 is already occupied by the person wearing sandals. This means the baseball player must be in House 3, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Person wearing sandals and Baseball player

From Clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in House 4, the cat lover must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 3, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the tennis player must be in House 3.

- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player

From Clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the golfer, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 5. But House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper, House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player, and House 5 is occupied by the baseball player and person wearing sandals. Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 5.

- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 2 and 3, but House 2 is occupied by the cricketer and fish enthusiast, and House 3 is occupied by the person wearing loafers and tennis player. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper. Therefore, the person who owns horses and the person who is wearing boots must be in Houses 1 and 2, but House 1 is occupied by the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Bird keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer and Fish enthusiast
- **House 3:** Person wearing loafers and Tennis player
- **House 4:** Golfer
- **House 5:** Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

From the remaining characteristics, the dog owner must be in House 1, 3, or 4. Since the bird keeper is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3 or 4. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the dog owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Golfer, Baseball player, Person wearing sandals, and Person wearing running shoes

Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3.

The number of the house where the dog owner lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in House 2.

From Clue 4, the person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with a computer. Therefore, the person eating grapes lives in House 1 and the person with a computer lives in House 2.

From Clue 1, the person with a radio and the person driving a truck live next to each other. Since the person with a computer lives in House 2, the person with a radio must live in House 1 (because the person with a radio lives to the left of the person with a computer).

From Clue 2, the person with a radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person with a radio lives in House 1, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person living in the houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who likes milk cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.**
   - This means the coffee drinker cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes yellow.

4. **The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people must be in consecutive houses.

5. **The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the last house (House 4) and must be to the left of the person who only drinks water.

7. **The person who likes green does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who likes green can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

8. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese can live in House 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza (from Clue 5)

From Clue 2, the person who likes milk must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water, and the person who likes milk cannot be in House 4, we can deduce:
- House 3: Milk
- House 4: Spaghetti and Water

From Clue 4, the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be next to each other. Since the person who only drinks water is in House 4, the person who likes white must be in House 3.

From Clue 7, the person who likes green does not live in the first house. Given the remaining options, the person who likes green must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 2.

The answer is: (D) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 8:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 12:** The person who likes white lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 13:** The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 12, we know:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast (likes white)
- House 3: Dog owner (likes white)

From Clue 8, we know:
- House 4: Horse owner

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in House 4, so they must live in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 1 and House 3 are already occupied, the person who likes yellow must live in House 2.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person wearing high heels must live in House 1 or 2. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person wearing high heels must live in House 2, which is also where the person who likes yellow lives.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing sandals must be in House 3, and the person driving a minivan must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. Since the person wearing high heels is in House 2, the person wearing loafers must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the root beer lover must be in House 1 or 2. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the root beer lover must be in House 1, and the coffee drinker must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the dog owner is in House 3, the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4. But House 1 is occupied by the fish enthusiast, so the person who likes milk must be in House 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in House 4, the person who likes red must be in House 2 or 3. But House 2 is occupied by the person who likes yellow and wears high heels, so the person who likes red must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the correct houses. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 11**: The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Baseball player

2. **Clue 8**: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing sandals

3. **Clue 15**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
   - This conflicts with Clue 11, so we need to re-evaluate. The correct interpretation is that the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker
   - House 4: Wearing loafers

4. **Clue 16**: The swimmer lives directly left of the golfer.
   - House 2: Swimmer
   - House 3: Golfer

5. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
   - Let's denote the house with grapes as G and the house with daffodils as D. G and D are 2 houses apart.

6. **Clue 17**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - House 1: Lilies
   - House 2: Grapes

7. **Clue 18**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - D < K

8. **Clue 14**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - T < Tulips

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a carnations arrangement and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
   - Let's denote the house with carnations as C and the house with the cricketer as Ck. C and Ck are next to each other.

10. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
    - Oranges ≠ House 3

11. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
    - Mangos ≠ House 1

12. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
    - House 3: Running shoes

13. **Clue 5**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
    - M < Water

14. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
    - Let's denote the house with boots as B and the house with daffodils as D. B and D are 2 houses apart.

15. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
    - Let's denote the house with water as W and the house with kiwis as K. W and K are 2 houses apart.

Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can now place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Lilies, Grapes
- House 2: Swimmer, Grapes
- House 3: Coffee drinker, Running shoes
- House 4: Wearing loafers, Golfer
- House 5: Remaining characteristics

From the remaining characteristics, we can deduce:
- House 5: Tea drinker, Root beer, Water, Kiwis, Boots, Tulips, Mangoes

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1, the answer is:

**(A) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - Since the golfer is in house 1, the person with lilies must be the golfer. Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

3. **The soccer player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the soccer player is in house 3.

4. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the soccer player in house 3 has daffodils, the person with tulips must be in house 1 or 2. Given that the golfer in house 1 has lilies, the person with tulips must be the basketball player in house 2.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Golfer with lilies
- House 2: Basketball player with tulips
- House 3: Soccer player with daffodils

The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place the characteristics of the people in the houses based on the given clues. Let's go through each clue step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The pianist lives in the third house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can place:
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Ate spaghetti

Next, we use Clue 7, which states that the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house. Since the pianist lives in the third house, the person who likes green cannot live there either. Therefore, the person who likes green must live in one of the remaining houses: 1, 2, or 5.

Now, let's use Clue 5, which states that the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house. This is consistent with our previous placement.

Next, Clue 4 states that the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4. However, House 4 is already occupied by the person who ate spaghetti. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 3.

- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti

Now, we use Clue 8, which states that there are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives. Since the person who likes yellow lives in House 3, the person who likes white must live in House 5.

- House 5: White

Next, Clue 10 states that the percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other, and the percussionist lives to the left of the cellist. Since the pianist lives in House 3, the percussionist and cellist must live in Houses 1 and 2 or Houses 2 and 3. But House 2 is already occupied by the person who had stew, so the percussionist must live in House 1, and the cellist must live in House 2.

- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: White

Finally, we need to place the remaining characteristics. The person who likes red must live in House 3, as the pianist lives there and the person who likes green cannot live there.

- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Stew, likes yellow
- House 3: Pianist, ate fried rice, likes red
- House 4: Spaghetti
- House 5: White, cello

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - This means the person who had stew is in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the person who is wearing sandals is in a house with a lower number than the root beer lover.

4. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in a house with a lower number than the person who only drinks water.

5. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.**
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.**
   - This means these two people are in consecutive houses.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, 3, or 4.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 (because the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese).
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since it cannot be in house 1 and the person who only drinks water is in house 4).

- The person who had stew must be in house 2 (since the person who had stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2).
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (since the person who had stew is in house 2 and the person who ate stew is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

- The person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person who is wearing sandals is to the left of the root beer lover, and the root beer lover is in house 4).

- The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1 (since the person who is wearing running shoes is to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew is in house 2).

### Final Arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Stew
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Spaghetti
- House 3: Tea drinker, Spaghetti
- House 4: High heels, Water

### Conclusion:

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

4. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Loafers

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the gameboy and grilled cheese are in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Since the radio is in house 3, the root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.

7. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 2.

8. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means milk and high heels are in adjacent houses.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
    - This means the tea drinker must be in a house to the left of the milk drinker.

11. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
    - This means boots and computer are in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 8**: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
    - This is consistent with the previous clue.

13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    - This means spaghetti and stew are in adjacent houses, with spaghetti to the left.

Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers
- House 4: Basketball player
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese (since the gameboy is directly left of the grilled cheese)
- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels (since the milk is directly left of the high heels and to the right of the tea drinker)

Since the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer, and the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Tea drinker, Milk, High heels
- House 2: Root beer lover, Gameboy, Grilled cheese
- House 3: Radio, Cricketer, Loafers, Boots
- House 4: Basketball player, Computer, Soccer player

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. There are two houses, numbered 1 and 2.
2. One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
3. One person is a science fiction book fanatic and the other is a history book buff.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

From clue 4, we know that the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in house 2 because the person who ate fried rice must live to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must live in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the people in the houses, let's deduce the correct information step by step:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Pianist

From clue 3, we know:
- House 2: Cannot be the person who likes white.

Since the person who likes white is in House 1, the person in House 2 cannot like white. 

From clue 2, we know:
- The root beer lover must be to the right of the person who owns horses.
- Since the person who owns horses cannot be in House 2 (because the root beer lover would then have to be in House 1, which is not possible as the pianist is in House 1), the person who owns horses must be in House 1.

Thus:
- House 1: Pianist, owns horses, likes white
- House 2: Root beer lover

Since the root beer lover is in House 2, the dog owner must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **(A) 1**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, people, their book preferences, lunch choices, and musical instruments.

1. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
4. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
5. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the known information:
- From clue 2, the person who had stew lives in the second house.
- From clue 7, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

So, we have:
- House 2: Stew
- House 4: Pizza

Next, using clue 5:
- There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1, 3, and 4, but not in the same house. Since house 4 is already occupied by pizza, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fried Rice
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Pizza

Next, using clue 3:
- The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

Since the violinist cannot be in house 4 (clue 4), the possible positions for the violinist are houses 1, 2, or 3. The guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, so the possible positions for the guitarist are houses 1, 2, or 3 as well.

Using clue 6:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Since the percussionist must be to the left of the history book buff, the percussionist cannot be in house 4. The possible positions for the percussionist are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Using clue 1:
- The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house 4, and the percussionist must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. The possible positions for the science fiction book fanatic are houses 1, 2, or 3.

Combining all the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Fried Rice, Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Stew, Percussionist
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast, History Book Buff
- House 4: Pizza, Violinist

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes white lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: White

2. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - House 2: Not boots

3. **The bird keeper does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not bird keeper

4. **The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - Since House 1 is white, the person with daffodils must live in House 2.

5. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
   - This means the person who likes green must live in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, or the person who likes green must live in House 2 and the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 3.

6. **The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means the horse owner must live in House 1 or House 2, and the dog owner must live in House 2 or House 3.

7. **The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
   - From clue 4, we know the person with daffodils lives in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must live in House 1.

8. **The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means the person with sandals must live in House 1 or House 2, and the person with tulips must live in House 2 or House 3.

Now, let's summarize what we have:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils

From clue 5, since the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and we know the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who likes green must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From clue 6, since the dog owner lives to the right of the horse owner, and the horse owner is in House 1, the dog owner must be in House 3.

From clue 7, since the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other, and the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person who owns horses is in House 1.

From clue 8, since the person who is wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person with daffodils is in House 2, the person with tulips must be in House 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: White, Green, Bird Keeper, Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils, Running Shoes, Horses
- House 3: Not bird keeper, Not horses, Not daffodils, Tulips, Dog Owner

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues and the arrangement of the houses, let's deduce the correct positions step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the milk drinker must be in consecutive houses.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
   - This means the mango eater and the apple eater must be in consecutive houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in either the first or the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - So, the apple eater is in house 3.

Given that the apple eater is in house 3, the mango eater must be in house 2 (since they are consecutive).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Mango eater
- House 3: Apple eater

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker (House 1) is directly left of the milk drinker, so the milk drinker must be in House 3.

Therefore, the milk drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, or the person who likes white must be in House 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 or House 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2 or House 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3, and the person who likes red must be in House 2 or House 3.

Given these clues, let's start placing the known information:

- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3 (from Clue 7), and the person who likes white must be directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 3), the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2, and the person who likes white must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white
- House 2: Vase of tulips, science fiction book fanatic

The person who likes red must be in House 3 (since the person who likes red is next to the person who is wearing loafers, and the only remaining house is House 3).

- House 3: Likes red

Since the history book buff lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the history book buff must be in House 3.

- House 3: Likes red, history book buff

The only remaining person is the one who is wearing boots, and since the person who is wearing boots cannot be in House 3 (Clue 5), the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1.

- House 1: Carnations arrangement, likes white, wearing boots

Thus, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The first house is occupied by the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 1, since the first house is occupied by the water drinker, the milk drinker must live in the third house (one house to the right of the water drinker).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 4, the lilies are in the second house.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 3, the tulips must be in the first house (since the lilies are in the second house and must be to the right of the tulips).

Now, we know:
- House 1: Tulips
- House 2: Lilies
- House 3: Milk drinker

The only flower left is the rose bouquet, and the only drink left is water. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third house.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is:
(B) 3"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with boots lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

2. **The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in a house to the left of the person who likes blue.

3. **The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the yellow and gameboy owners are in consecutive houses.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**
   - This means the cricketer and the person wearing sandals are in consecutive houses, with the cricketer in the left house.

5. **The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.**
   - This means the yellow owner is in house 3.

6. **The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the phone owner lives in house 1, 3, or 4.

7. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.**
   - This means the gameboy owner is in a house to the right of the phone owner.

8. **The tennis player lives in the third house.**
   - This means the tennis player is in house 3.

9. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - This means the loafers owner is in house 1.

10. **The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
    - This means the phone and radio owners are in consecutive houses, with the phone owner in the left house.

11. **The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.**
    - This means the swimmer is in a house to the left of the green owner.

Using these clues, we can deduce the following:

- **House 1:**
  - Loafers (from clue 9)
  - Phone (from clue 6 and 10, since the phone owner cannot be in house 2 and must be left of the radio owner)
  - Green (from clue 11, since the green owner must be to the right of the swimmer, and the only house left for the green owner is 2 or 4. If the green owner were in house 4, the swimmer would have to be in house 3, but the tennis player is already in house 3. So, the green owner must be in house 2, and the swimmer in house 1)

- **House 2:**
  - Green (from the above deduction)
  - Radio (from clue 10, since the phone owner is in house 1)

- **House 3:**
  - Tennis player (from clue 8)
  - Gameboy (from clue 3, since the yellow owner is in house 3 and the gameboy owner must be to the right of the phone owner, who is in house 1)

- **House 4:**
  - Boots (from clue 1, since the boots owner cannot be in house 2)
  - Yellow (from clue 5)
  - Sandals (from clue 4, since the cricketer lives directly left of the person wearing sandals)
  - Swimmer (from clue 11, since the swimmer must be to the left of the green owner, who is in house 2)

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the yellow lover is in the first house.

From clue 2, the romance book lover is directly left of the history book buff. Since the yellow lover is in the first house, the romance book lover must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the pizza eater cannot be in the first house, so the pizza eater must be in the second or third house. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the third house.

From clue 5, the fried rice eater is to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fried rice eater must be in the third house, confirming the history book buff is in the third house and ate fried rice.

From clue 1, the green lover must be in the second house because the green lover lives to the left of the history book buff, who is in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow lover
- House 2: Green lover
- House 3: Fried rice (History book buff)

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is:

(A) 1"

5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2**: The golfer does not live in the second house. Therefore, the golfer must live in either house 1 or house 3.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
3. **Clue 5**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
5. **Clue 1**: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Combining the Clues:

- From Clue 2, the golfer is in either house 1 or house 3.
- From Clue 3, the computer and vase of tulips are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or houses 2 and 3.
- From Clue 5, the radio is to the right of the television, so the television cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 4, the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet, so the rose bouquet cannot be in house 3, and the radio cannot be in house 1.
- From Clue 1, the tennis player is to the left of the television, so the television cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

### Possible Arrangements:

- If the golfer is in house 1:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 2 and 3 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Golfer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This does not satisfy Clue 4 (the radio is to the right of the rose bouquet).

- If the golfer is in house 3:
  - The computer and vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 (since they are next to each other).
  - The television cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so it must be in house 2.
  - The radio must be in house 3 (since it is to the right of the television and the rose bouquet).

  This arrangement would be:
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Television
  - House 3: Radio

  This satisfies all the clues:
  - Clue 1: The tennis player (house 1) is to the left of the television (house 2).

From Clue 5, the violinist lives in the second house. Therefore, the second house is occupied by the violinist, and the baseball player must be in the first house.

From Clue 6, the basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist. Since the violinist is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house. This is consistent with the violinist being in the second house.

From Clue 3, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the basketball player is in the first house, the person with sandals must be in the first house, and the person with a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the fifth house, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the cricketer. Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in the third house, and the person with high heels must be in the first house.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist. Since the person with high heels is in the first house, the person with loafers must be in the second house, and the percussionist must be in the third house. However, the second house is already occupied by the violinist, and the third house is already occupied by the person with a vase of tulips. Therefore, the person with loafers must be in the first house, and the percussionist must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist. Since the guitarist is in the second house, the person with a carnations arrangement must be in the third house. However, the third house is already occupied by the person with a vase of tulips. Therefore, the person with a carnations arrangement must be in the fourth house, and the person with a rose bouquet must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives. Since the person with sandals is in the second house, the cellist must be in the fifth house.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is \(\boxed{B}\)."

2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the person in house 1 is wearing high heels and lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.
- Therefore, the person in house 2 is the fish enthusiast and ate grilled cheese.

This leaves us with:
- House 1: Wears high heels
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, ate grilled cheese

Since each person has a different pet and the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner.

Since the romance book lover is in the first house and the science fiction book fanatic is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third and fourth houses. However, the fourth house is occupied by the percussionist, so the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 3: There are two houses between the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. This means the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater are not in consecutive houses, and there are two houses in between.

Using Clue 1: The root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other. This means they are in consecutive houses.

Using Clue 4: There is one house between the red lover and the yellow lover. Since the yellow lover is in the second house, the red lover must be in the first house.

Using Clue 8: The stew eater does not live in the third house. Using Clue 9: The stew eater lives directly left of the water drinker. This means the stew eater and the water drinker are in consecutive houses, and the stew eater is in the second house.

Using Clue 10: The white lover lives to the right of the stew eater. Since the stew eater is in the second house, the white lover must be in the third or fourth house.

Using Clue 5: There is one house between the mango eater and the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the second house, the mango eater must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Mango eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker
- House 4: White lover

We need to place the root beer lover and the grilled cheese eater. Since the root beer lover and the milk drinker are next to each other, and there are two houses between them and the grilled cheese eater, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater

Finally, we need to place the pizza eater and the yellow lover. Since the pizza eater is to the left of the yellow lover, and the yellow lover is in the second house, the pizza eater must be in the first house. This is consistent with the previous placements.

Thus, the sequence is:
- House 1: Root beer lover, milk drinker, pizza eater
- House 2: Orange eater, yellow lover
- House 3: Stew eater, water drinker, grilled cheese eater
- House 4: White lover

The person who is eating apples lives in House 4.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Since the first house has a convertible, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with running shoes and the person with high heels must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person with sandals and the person with boots must be in consecutive houses, with sandals to the right.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in consecutive houses, with the history book buff to the left.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the SUV and the history book buff must be in consecutive houses, with the SUV to the left.

7. **Clue 8:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the person who ate fried rice must be in consecutive houses, with the fantasy book enthusiast to the left.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person who had stew and the science fiction book fanatic must be in consecutive houses, with the person who had stew to the left.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the convertible is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Let's start placing the information:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (since it's directly left of the history book buff)
- House 3: History book buff (since it's directly left of the SUV)
- House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast (since it's directly left of the person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since the convertible is in house 1, the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But house 2 is already taken by the SUV, so the truck and mystery book reader must be in houses 3 and 4. Since house 3 is the history book buff, the mystery book reader must be in house 4.

- The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

- The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3.

Now, we have:

- House 1: Convertible
- House 2: SUV (history book buff)
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (running shoes, sandals)
- House 4: Mystery book reader (grilled cheese, stew, science fiction book fanatic)

The person who had pizza must be in house 1, as all other houses have been assigned.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is:

**(A) 1**"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each person in their respective house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third or fifth house.

4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, this clue is satisfied.

6. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. The only remaining houses are the first and fifth. So, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. The romance book lover is in the second house, and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house (since the fifth house is already assigned to the guitarist).

So, the arrangement is:
1. History book buff
2. Romance book lover
3. Percussionist
4. Mystery book reader
5. Fantasy book enthusiast (Guitarist)

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is:
(C) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Television

2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Loafers

3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
   - Since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the phone must be in either House 1, 3, or 4. But House 4 is already assigned to Television, so the phone must be in either House 1 or House 3.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Since the person in House 2 is wearing loafers, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots.
   - House 1: Boots

5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the radio and sandals are in houses that are two apart. Given the current arrangement, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3) or (House 2, House 4). But since House 2 is already assigned to Loafers, the only possible pair is (House 1, House 3).

   - House 1: Boots, Radio
   - House 3: Sandals

Now, we have:
- House 1: Boots, Radio
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The remaining devices are the phone and the gameboy. Since House 3 is already assigned to Sandals, the phone must be in House 3.

- House 3: Sandals, Phone

This leaves House 4 with the gameboy.

- House 4: Television, Gameboy

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
5. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person wearing high heels and the third house by the person wearing running shoes, the first house must be occupied by the person wearing loafers.

Now, let's assign the drinks:

- Clue 3 states that the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the milk drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the milk drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- Clue 4 states that the coffee drinker does not live in the first house. Since the first house is the only one left for the person wearing loafers, the coffee drinker cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the coffee drinker must live in the third house, where the person is wearing running shoes.
- This leaves the second house, where the person is wearing high heels, as the only place for the water drinker.

So, we have:
- House 1: Loafers, not milk, not coffee, must be water.
- House 2: High heels, not coffee, not milk, must be water.
- House 3: Running shoes, coffee, milk.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we deduce that the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

From clue 2, since the mystery book reader cannot live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given characteristics in the houses based on the provided clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

Let's start by placing the items and people based on these clues:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 8, the person with running shoes and the person with a rose bouquet are next to each other. Since the person with running shoes cannot be in the third house (Clue 3), the only possible positions are:
  - House 1: Running shoes, Rose bouquet
  - House 2: Running shoes, Rose bouquet

- From Clue 4, the person with a vase of tulips is directly left of the person who had pizza. This means:
  - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 1, the person with pizza is in House 2.
  - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 2, the person with pizza is in House 3.
  - If the person with a vase of tulips is in House 3, the person with pizza is in House 4.

- From Clue 2, the person with pizza is directly left of the person with sandals. This means:
  - If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with sandals is in House 3.
  - If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with sandals is in House 4.

- From Clue 5, the person with carnations is to the left of the person with sandals. This means:

  - If the person with sandals is in House 4, the person with carnations is in House 3.

- From Clue 6, the person with running shoes is directly left of the person who had stew. This means:
  - If the person with running shoes is in House 1, the person with stew is in House 2.
  - If the person with running shoes is in House 2, the person with stew is in House 3.

- From Clue 7, the person with a television is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
  - If the person with a television is in House 1, the person with a radio is in House 2.
  - If the person with a television is in House 2, the person with a radio is in House 3.

- From Clue 9, the person with boots is to the left of the person who had pizza. This means:
  - If the person with pizza is in House 2, the person with boots is in House 1.
  - If the person with pizza is in House 3, the person with boots is in House 1 or House 2.
  - If the person with pizza is in House 4, the person with boots is in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

- From Clue 10, the person with spaghetti is directly left of the person who has a radio. This means:
  - If the person with a radio is in House 2, the person with spaghetti is in House 1.
  - If the person with a radio is in House 3, the person with spaghetti is in House 2.
  - If the person with a radio is in House 4, the person with spaghetti is in House 3.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Running shoes, Television, Boots, Stew
- House 2: Rose bouquet, Carnations, Pizza, Spaghetti
- House 3: Vase of tulips, Radio
- House 4: Sandals

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives in the left house (House 1).
2. The person with the lilies lives in the right house (House 2).
3. The saxophonist does not live in the first house, so the saxophonist must live in the second house.
4. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.

From these deductions, we can conclude:
- House 1: Mangoes, Rose bouquet, Saxophonist
- House 2: Apples, Lilies, Pianist

Therefore, the person eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person with the television must be in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer is in the third house, and the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house. However, the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this clue is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the swimmer is in the second house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This is already satisfied by the previous deduction.
6. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the fifth house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house and the person who likes white must be in the second house.
8. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the cricketer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the cricketer is in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first house.
10. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a computer must be in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who has a phone is in the fifth house.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. Since the basketball player is in the second house, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the person who drives a minivan is in the first house, the root beer lover must be in the second house.
14. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the person who likes milk is in the fifth house.
15. **Clue 14**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who likes red is in the third house, the golfer must be in the fourth house, but the coffee drinker is already in the fourth house, so this is a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the positions. Given the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the only way to satisfy this clue is if the golfer is in the fifth house.

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the vase of tulips is in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means if the SUV is in house 1, the lilies are in house 2.
   - If the SUV is in house 2, the lilies are in house 3.
   - If the SUV is in house 3, there is no house to the right for lilies, so this is not possible.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 and 2, or house 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the rose bouquet:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, then the sedan must be in house 2 (from Clue 3).

Now, let's consider the placement of the SUV and lilies:

- If the rose bouquet is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 3.
- If the rose bouquet is in house 3, the SUV must be in house 2 (from Clue 2), and the lilies must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Rose bouquet in house 1, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 3**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 3, so the person with the lilies is in house 3.
- This scenario is consistent with all clues.

**Scenario 2: Rose bouquet in house 3, SUV in house 2, lilies in house 1**
- The vase of tulips must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).
- The sedan is in house 2, so the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1, so the person with the lilies is in house 1.
- This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to determine which one is correct by checking the car assignments:

- In Scenario 1, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 3.
- In Scenario 2, the sedan is in house 2, the SUV is in house 2, and the truck is in house 1.

Given the constraints, the only consistent scenario is:

- Rose bouquet in house 1
- Sedan in house 2
- SUV in house 2
- Lilies in house 3
- Tulips in house 2

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

12. **Clue 3**: The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
13. **Clue 8**: The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 2 and Clue 10, we know:
- House 5: Vase of tulips
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies

Using Clue 4 and Clue 12, we need to place the person with a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk, and the fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover next to each other. Let's consider the possible positions for these pairs.

From Clue 13 and Clue 7, we know:
- History book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.
- Percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
- Coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From Clue 6, we know:
- Person with a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.

From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know:
- Violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
- Violinist does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, we know:
- Romance book lover does not live in the third house.

5. House 5: Vase of tulips, Water drinker, Violinist

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 13**: The person who likes yellow lives in the first house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and is eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the first, second, or third house.

4. **Clue 6**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house, the swimmer cannot be in the first house. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house either.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white. This means the person who is eating a banana and the person who likes white must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos and the person who is eating oranges must be in consecutive houses, with mangos to the left.

7. **Clue 2 and Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third or second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first or fourth house. Since the convertible is in the fourth house, the SUV must be in the first house.

8. **Clue 10**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

9. **Clue 11**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the second house, the person who likes white must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house.

10. **Clue 12**: The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other. Since the SUV is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house.

11. **Clue 3**: The soccer player does not live in the fourth house. Since the cricketer lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible, and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first, second, or third house. The soccer player cannot be in the fourth house, so the soccer player must be in the first, second, or third house.

12. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives. Since the cricketer cannot be in the first house (yellow and kiwis), and the convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the third house, and the swimmer must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Yellow, Kiwis, Soccer Player, Swimmer
- House 2: Blue, Banana, Minivan
- House 3: White, Cricketer
- House 4: Convertible

The only sport left is basketball, and the only car left is the truck. Therefore, the basketball player must live in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow and the person who likes green live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

3. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is already occupied by the yellow lover, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

4. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 1 or 3. Since house 1 is occupied by the person who had stew, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.

5. The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the person who had stew is in house 1, and the romance book lover is in house 2.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: Stew, Romance book lover
- House 2: Grilled cheese, Yellow (favorite color)
- House 3: Green (favorite color), Fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person in house 3 likes green, the person in house 1 must like blue (the only color left).

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know:
- **House 1:** Carnations

From Clue 4, we know:
- **House 3:** Yellow

From Clue 1, since the vase of tulips and the bird keeper are next to each other, and House 1 has carnations, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 3 is yellow, the vase of tulips and the bird keeper must be in House 2.

From Clue 5, since there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet, and the rose bouquet cannot be in House 1 or 3, it must be in House 2. Therefore, the person who owns horses must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, since the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other, and the person who owns horses is in House 3, the person who likes blue must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, since the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, and the bird keeper is in House 2, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 1, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 2.

From Clue 2, since there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck, and the fish enthusiast is in House 2, the percussionist must be in House 1 and the person who drives a truck must be in House 3.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives to the left of the person who likes red.

From clues 1 and 2, we can conclude that the person in the first house is both a fantasy book enthusiast and a cellist. Since the person in the first house likes green (from clue 3), we can summarize:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, cellist, likes green.

Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes red must be in house 2. The only remaining book type for house 2 is a mystery book. Therefore, the person in house 2 is a mystery book reader and likes red.

Thus, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the positions step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the clues that give us direct positions:

- **Clue 8:** The baseball player lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the baseball player is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.
- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who is wearing high heels is in house 1.
- **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the history book buff is in house 4 and the person who ate fried rice is in house 5.
- **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who is eating grapes is in house 3 and the golfer is in house 4.
- **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 5, which is consistent with the history book buff.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:

- **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating mangos is in house 2 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 2 or 3, but since house 2 is occupied by the person who is eating mangos, the person who is eating apples is in house 3.
- **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the person who is eating apples lives. This means the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
- **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2.
- **Clue 11:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. This is consistent with the science fiction book fanatic being in house 2 and the golfer in house 4.
- **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. This means the person who is wearing boots is in house 1 and the person who is wearing loafers is in house 3.
- **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the person who had stew is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 4.
- **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader is in house 3.
- **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the mystery book reader lives. This means the swimmer is in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is \(\boxed{B}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the swimmer:

1. The golfer lives in the second house (Clue 2).
2. The history book buff lives in the first house (Clue 3).
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives (Clue 1).

Since the history book buff is in the first house, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be there. The golfer is in the second house, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

This leaves the swimmer to be in the first house, as there is one house between the swimmer and the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.

Let's start by placing the bird keeper in the third house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: ?

Next, let's use Clue 7 to place the banana eater and the soccer player:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 5 to place the cat lover and the person who ate spaghetti:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Using Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the history book buff:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Banana Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2 (Clue 5):

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

Now, let's use Clue 9 to place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who had pizza:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Bird Keeper
- House 4: Soccer Player

The science fiction book fanatic is directly left of the person who had pizza, so:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Pizza Eater

Using Clue 11, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the baseball player:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 10 to place the person who is eating grapes and the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast:

- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The person who is eating grapes must be in House 1:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Now, let's use Clue 2 to place the romance book lover:

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The romance book lover lives to the right of the swimmer, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person eating apples (Clue 1):

- House 1: Grapes Eater
- House 2: Spaghetti Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The swimmer must be in House 1, and the person eating apples must be in House 2:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

Finally, let's use Clue 3 to place the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Baseball Player

The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Now, let's use Clue 4 to place the person who ate fried rice:

- House 1: Swimmer
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1:

- House 1: Fried Rice Eater
- House 2: Apples Eater
- House 3: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 4: Horses Owner

Thus, the person who had stew lives in House 1. The answer is:

**(B) 1**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing sandals, then the person in house 2 owns horses, and vice versa.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house 2, because the history book buff must be to the right of them.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 must be the history book buff (since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti). However, this would mean the person in house 2 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 1 is wearing sandals. This scenario is consistent with all clues.

- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 must be the history book buff. But this would mean the person in house 1 owns horses (from Clue 1), and the person in house 2 is wearing sandals. This scenario is also consistent with all clues.

Now, let's determine the person who ate fried rice:

- If the person in house 1 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 2 ate fried rice.
- If the person in house 2 ate spaghetti, then the person in house 1 ate fried rice.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Given the characteristics and clues provided, let's deduce the correct answer step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the sedan must live in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - Since the person in house 1 is not the flutist, the person in house 2 must be the flutist.

From Clue 1, we can infer:
- House 1: Sedan
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies

From Clue 2, we can infer:
- House 1: Not a flutist
- House 2: Flutist

Since the person in house 2 is the flutist and has a bouquet of lilies, the person in house 1 must be the saxophonist and has a bouquet of daffodils.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

Using **Clue 8**:
- There is one house between the person with a bouquet of daffodils and the person with a rose bouquet.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Next, using **Clue 1**:
- There is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
- Since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person with a rose bouquet is in the third house, the mystery book reader and the swimmer must be in the first and second houses.

Using **Clue 4**:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
- This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the swimmer in the second house.

So, we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Now, using **Clue 2**:
- The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.

3. Rose bouquet
4. Carnations

Using **Clue 5**:
- The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is in the first house, so the golfer must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person with a rose bouquet, so the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Rose bouquet
4. Golfer

Using **Clue 7**:
- The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
- The fourth house is occupied by the golfer, so the tennis player must be in the third house.

So, we have:
1. Mystery book reader
2. Swimmer
3. Tennis player
4. Golfer

Finally, using **Clue 9**:
- There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in House 2 and the person who had stew lives in House 4.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

4. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is also consistent with the previous clue, so the person who had stew lives in House 4.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - So, the person who likes green lives in House 1, 3, 4, or 5.

6. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in House 1, 2, or 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow lives in House 3. If the person who likes white lives in House 2, the person who likes yellow lives in House 4. If the person who likes white lives in House 3, the person who likes yellow lives in House 5.

Given the information:
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Stew
- House 2: Red

We need to place the remaining items and colors. Since the person who likes green cannot live in House 2, and considering the placement of the other items, the person who likes green must live in House 5.

This leaves House 1 and House 3 for the person who likes blue and the person who ate grilled cheese, respectively. Given the clue about the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow, if the person who likes white lives in House 1, the person who likes yellow would live in House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in House 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in House 2.

The answer is (E) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the basketball player step-by-step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. The percussionist lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives to the right of the basketball player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The basketball player lives to the right of the tennis player.

From clue 2, the percussionist is in the second house. This means the second house is ruled out for the violinist and the basketball player.

From clue 3, the violinist must be in the first or third house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the violinist must be in the first house.

From clue 5, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the only possible house for the tennis player is the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first or third house. But the violinist is in the first house, so the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, which is the basketball player.

Thus, the basketball player lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To determine the house where the person with a carnations arrangement lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues and place the characteristics step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover. This means the computer is in house 1 and the root beer lover is in house 2.
2. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live directly next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.
3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. So, the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4 or 5.
5. **Clue 14:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4.
6. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist. So, the cellist must be in house 5.
7. **Clue 6:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy. Since the cellist is in house 5, the gameboy must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).
8. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 5 (since the cellist is in house 5).
9. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the cellist is in house 5, the guitarist must be in house 3 (coffee drinker is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 5).
10. **Clue 12:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the root beer lover is in house 2 and the percussionist is in house 5, this is consistent.
11. **Clue 10:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in house 3, the milk drinker must be in house 1 (phone).
12. **Clue 11:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the guitarist is in house 3 and the phone is in house 1, this is consistent.
13. **Clue 16:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. Since the tea drinker is in house 1 (phone) and the pianist is in house 5 (cellist), this is consistent.
14. **Clue 9:** The cellist does not live in the fourth house, so the cellist is in house 5.
15. **Clue 15:** The carnations arrangement cannot be in the fifth house, so the carnations arrangement must be in house 1, 2, or 4. Since house 1 is the phone and house 2 is the root beer lover, the carnations arrangement must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."

16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the known information:

- **House 2:** Dog owner
- **House 3:** Fish enthusiast

From Clue 13, the person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner, so the minivan cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 3, 4, or 5.

From Clue 6, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, so the minivan cannot be in House 3. Therefore, the minivan can be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 1, the minivan does not live in House 3, so the minivan must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives. This means the truck and the convertible cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the convertible:

- If the truck is in House 1, the convertible must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 2, the convertible must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 3, the convertible must be in House 1 or 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the convertible must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the convertible must be in House 2 or 3.

From Clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer. This means the truck and the computer cannot be in consecutive houses. Let's consider the possible positions for the truck and the computer:

- If the truck is in House 2, the computer must be in House 4.
- If the truck is in House 3, the computer must be in House 5.
- If the truck is in House 4, the computer must be in House 2.
- If the truck is in House 5, the computer must be in House 3.

From Clue 11, the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. This means the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 15, the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other. This means the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses.

From Clue 10, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper cannot be in House 5.

From Clue 7, the person who has a gameboy does not live in House 2.

From Clue 9, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person who has a computer does not live in House 5.

From Clue 17, there is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

By analyzing the clues and the possible positions, we can deduce the following:

- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Minivan
- House 5: Convertible

From Clue 8, the truck must be in House 3, and the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 11, the vase of tulips and the convertible must be in consecutive houses. Since the convertible is in House 5, the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

From Clue 15, the carnations arrangement and the vase of tulips must be in consecutive houses. Since the vase of tulips is in House 4, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 10, the gameboy must be in House 5, and the bird keeper must be in House 4.

From Clue 2, the gameboy must be in House 1.

From Clue 16, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.

From Clue 12, the truck must be in House 3, and the convertible must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the computer must be in House 5.

From Clue 17, the television must be in House 1, and the SUV must be in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer lives in house 2 and the tea drinker lives in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

Given Clues 5 and 6, we see that the saxophonist and the basketball player both live in house 1. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the clues. Let's assume the saxophonist and the basketball player are in different houses:

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so the cricketer is in house 2 and the tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so the dog owner is in house 2 and the person who had pizza is in house 1.
- The basketball player lives in house 1.
- The saxophonist lives in house 3.

Now, let's fit the remaining clues:

- Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
  - The fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water are not in adjacent houses, and there is one house in between them.
  - Since the tea drinker is in house 1 and the cricketer is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 and house 1, respectively.

- Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
  - The person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker, basketball player, fish enthusiast, had stew.
- House 2: Cricketer, dog owner, had pizza.
- House 3: Saxophonist, person who only drinks water, likes milk.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 is a history book buff.

2. **Clue 3:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the cat lover must live in the first house.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the cat lover (and thus the history book buff) lives in the first house, the person in the second house cannot be wearing high heels. Therefore, the person in the second house must be wearing high heels, and the person in the first house must have the bouquet of daffodils.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the person in the second house is wearing high heels, the person in the first house must be wearing loafers. Therefore, the person in the first house has the computer.

Summarizing the information:
- **House 1:** History book buff, cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.
- **House 2:** Wearing high heels, has a cat (since the cat lover does not live in the second house).

The only remaining characteristic for the person in the second house is being a fish enthusiast. Therefore, the person in the second house is a fish enthusiast, wearing high heels, and has a cat.

The person in the first house, who is a history book buff, a cat lover, wearing loafers, has a computer, and has a bouquet of daffodils.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by organizing the information and clues:

1. **House and Fruit:**
   - House 3: Apples
   - House 4: Not Kiwis
   - House 5: Not Mangos
   - Apples live directly left of Fried Rice
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew live next to each other
   - Mangos do not live in House 4 or 5
   - Banana and Pianist are 2 houses apart
   - Grilled Cheese lives to the right of Percussionist
   - Pizza lives to the right of Saxophonist
   - Apples live to the left of Daffodils
   - Pizza does not live in House 5
   - Carnations in House 1

2. **House and Instrument:**
   - Pianist does not live in House 5
   - Daffodils live directly left of Rose
   - Daffodils and Rose are not in the same house
   - Tulips are not in House 3
   - Violinist, Pianist, Saxophonist, Guitarist, and Percussionist are in different houses

3. **House and Lunch:**
   - Fried Rice is directly right of Apples
   - Grilled Cheese and Stew are next to each other
   - Pizza is to the right of Saxophonist
   - Stew and Grilled Cheese are next to each other
   - Pizza is not in House 5

Let's start placing the information:

- **House 1: Carnations**
- **House 3: Apples**
- **House 4: Not Kiwis, not Mangos, not Grilled Cheese, not Stew, not Fried Rice**
- **House 5: Not Mangos, not Pizza**

From clue 4, the person who eats apples (House 3) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Therefore, House 4 must be where the person ate fried rice.

From clue 10, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since House 1 has carnations, the only possible positions for daffodils and rose are House 2 and House 3, but House 3 is already occupied by apples. Therefore, daffodils must be in House 2 and rose in House 3.

From clue 14, the person who is eating apples (House 3) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). This is consistent with our previous placement.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. Since House 1 has carnations, House 2 has daffodils, and House 3 has apples, the only possible positions for banana and pianist are House 5 and House 1, respectively, or House 4 and House 2, respectively. But House 4 is already occupied by fried rice, so the only possible positions are House 5 (banana) and House 1 (pianist).

From clue 7, the pianist does not live in House 5, so the pianist must live in House 1, and the person who ate banana must live in House 5.

From clue 13, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist. Since House 5 is occupied by banana, the saxophonist must live in House 4, and the person who had pizza must live in House 2.

From clue 12, the guitarist does not live in House 3, so the guitarist must live in House 4, which is already occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the guitarist must live in House 2.

From clue 8, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in House 3, so the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 5.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live next to each other. Since House 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the only possible positions for stew and grilled cheese are House 3 and House 4, but House 3 is occupied by apples. Therefore, the person who had stew must live in House 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in House 3.

From clue 6, the person who is eating mangos does not live in House 4 or 5, so the person who is eating mangos must live in House 2.

From clue 15, the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, so the person who had pizza must live in House 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Since the guitarist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), and the person who has a vase of tulips cannot be in House 1 (since House 1 has a carnations arrangement), the guitarist must be in House 2, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3.

- **House 2:** Rose bouquet, History book buff, Guitarist

From Clue 5, the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who likes white cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the person who likes yellow is in House 3, the person who likes white must be in House 4, and the romance book lover must be in House 5 (but there is no House 5, so it must be in House 4).

- **House 4:** White, Romance book lover, Fantasy book enthusiast

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in House 4 (Clue 12), and the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (Clue 9), the person who likes blue must be in House 1, and the percussionist must be in House 2.

- **House 1:** Pizza, Carnations, Blue

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. This means the violinist is to the left of the flutist.
3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the grapes-eater and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.
4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. This means the violinist and the kiwi-eater are two houses apart.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if the violinist and the kiwi-eater are in houses 1 and 3, respectively, and the pianist is in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the flutist must be in house 3, which contradicts the previous arrangement. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the grapes-eater must be in house 1, the kiwi-eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Grapes-eater
- House 2: Kiwi-eater
- House 3: Pianist

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **(A) 3**."
"Given the clues:
1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we deduce that the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house since they cannot live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the person in the second house must be eating oranges.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic into the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. **Clue 4:** The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.

From Clue 8 and Clue 9, we know:
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who has a radio lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, since the bird keeper and the person who has a television live next to each other, and the person who has a radio lives in the third house, the bird keeper must live in the second house, and the person who has a television must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house, which matches the person who has a television.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the dog owner cannot be in the fourth house (where the person who ate grilled cheese lives), the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house. However, the second house is already occupied by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the dog owner must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the bird keeper is in the second house, the cat lover must be in the third or fourth house. But the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, so the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house and the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, this is consistent.

From Clue 11, the person who has a computer does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who has a computer must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who has a computer must be in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the dog owner, the person who likes green must be in the first, third, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the person who likes red and has a radio, the person who had pizza must be in the first, second, or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the dog owner, and the fourth house is occupied by the person who has a television, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Yellow, Computer, Dog owner, Pizza
2. Green, Fried rice, Cat lover, Television
3. Red, Radio, Grilled cheese, Bird keeper

Therefore, the person who likes red lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

From Clue 1, we can deduce that the root beer lover must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the pianist lives directly left of the cellist. Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must live in the first house and the cellist in the second house.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

Starting with Clue 7, we know:
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in House 4:
- House 4: Boots
- House 5: Carnations

From Clue 2, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 3, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 4 (but House 4 is already occupied by boots, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 4, and the person wearing loafers must be in House 5:
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

From Clue 3, the person wearing sandals cannot be in House 5, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since House 4 and 5 are already occupied, the person wearing sandals must be in House 1:
- House 1: Sandals

From Clue 4, there is one house between the person wearing running shoes and the person with a bouquet of lilies. Since House 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are occupied, the only possible positions are:
- House 2: Running Shoes
- House 3: Bouquet of Lilies

From Clue 5, the person with the vase of tulips (House 4) lives to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. Since House 4 is already occupied by the vase of tulips, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2:
- House 2: Daffodils

From Clue 8, the person with the bouquet of daffodils (House 2) and the person wearing running shoes (House 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent with our arrangement.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Running Shoes
- House 4: Vase of Tulips
- House 5: Loafers

From Clue 6, the person with the vase of tulips (House 4) does not live in the fourth house, which is consistent with our arrangement.

Finally, the only shoes left are high heels, which must be in House 3:
- House 3: Running Shoes, High Heels

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each person in their respective house based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
4. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives.
6. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
8. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
9. **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the tea drinker lives.

11. **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
12. **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's start by placing the people based on the clues:

- **Clue 10 and Clue 4:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other, and the swimmer lives to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 9:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker. This means the tea drinker is in the house immediately to the right of the person who only drinks water.

- **Clue 3 and Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white, and the swimmer is to the left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white, the swimmer, and the person who only drinks water are in consecutive houses, with the swimmer on the left, the person who likes white in the middle, and the person who only drinks water on the right.

- **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house. This means the baseball player is in one of the other three houses.

- **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the tennis player lives. This means the tennis player and the person who is eating grapes are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the saxophonist is in a house to the left of the tennis player.

- **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who likes green lives. This means the percussionist and the person who likes green are in consecutive houses, with one house in between.

- **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. This means the person who is eating oranges is in the house immediately to the right of the person who likes blue.

- **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. This means the person who likes blue is in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

- **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the pianist is in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

By combining all these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. House 1: Pianist, Coffee drinker
2. House 2: Baseball player
3. House 3: Swimmer, Person who likes white, Person who only drinks water
4. House 4: Tennis player, Person who is eating grapes, Person who likes green, Percussionist, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges, Tea drinker

From this arrangement, we can see that the pianist lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the pianist lives is:

**(C) 1**"
"To solve this problem, we need to use the given clues to deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing high heels lives in either house 1 or house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 likes white.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 likes green.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels. If the person in house 2 is wearing boots, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot live in house 1 if the person in house 1 is wearing boots.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in either house 1 or house 3.

Let's start by placing the person who likes white in house 1 and the person who likes green in house 2.

- House 1: White
- House 2: Green

From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.

- House 3: Spaghetti

From Clue 4, the person who likes green lives in house 2, so the person in house 2 is not wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing boots.

- House 1: White, Boots

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 2 must be wearing high heels.

- House 2: Green, High Heels

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew. Since the person in house 1 is wearing boots, the person in house 3 must have stew.

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in house 2, which is consistent with our placement.

Now, we need to determine the shoes and favorite colors for the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: White, Boots
- House 2: Green, High Heels
- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew

The person in house 1 (wearing boots) must like red (since white and green are already taken).

- House 1: White, Boots, Red

The person in house 2 (wearing high heels) must like green (already assigned).

- House 2: Green, High Heels, Green

The person in house 3 (wearing running shoes, since boots and high heels are taken) must like white (since red and green are already taken).

- House 3: Spaghetti, Stew, White

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

Starting with Clue 5:
- The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

Using Clue 4:
- The person with a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Since the rose bouquet is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or third house.

Considering Clue 1:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house, as there would be no space to the left. Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house, and the fantasy book enthusiast in the first house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Rose bouquet
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 2:
- The romance book lover lives to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations arrangement, the carnations arrangement must be in the first or second house.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house, the carnations arrangement cannot be in the first house. Therefore, the carnations arrangement must be in the second house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Science fiction book fanatic
4. (Unknown)

Using Clue 3:
- The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the romance book lover is in the third house, the vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now we have:
1. Fantasy book enthusiast
2. Carnations arrangement
3. Romance book lover
4. Vase of tulips

The only book left is the mystery book, which must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes yellow is directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. But house 2 already has the convertible, so the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.

From clue 2, we know:
- There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 1 or house 2. But house 1 already has the person who likes yellow, so the person who likes white must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

Therefore, the answer is:
**(C) 3**"
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice is in the second house. From clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is also in the second house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Using clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house. This means the science fiction book fanatic, who is also the person who ate spaghetti, is in the first house.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (ate spaghetti)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (ate fried rice)
- House 3: (unknown person, unknown food, unknown book)

The remaining food and book types are:
- Grilled cheese
- Mystery book

Since the science fiction book fanatic and the fantasy book enthusiast are already assigned, the person in House 3 must be the mystery book reader and ate grilled cheese.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

Since the houses are numbered 1 (left) and 2 (right), and the carnations arrangement must be to the left of the dog owner, the person with the carnations must live in house 1, and the person with the dog must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues and the characteristics of the people in the houses, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
3. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person in house 2 is eating kiwis.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
- Since the person in house 2 is eating kiwis, the person in house 1 must be drinking water (because the person in house 2 cannot be drinking water as per clue 1).

From clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
- Since the person in house 1 is drinking water, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals (because the person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals as per clue 2).

Now, we have:
- House 1: Drinking water, wearing sandals
- House 2: Eating kiwis

We need to determine the remaining characteristics for each house:
- The person in house 1 cannot be wearing high heels (clue 1) and cannot be drinking milk (since they are drinking water).
- The person in house 2 cannot be wearing sandals (clue 2) and cannot be eating grapes (since they are eating kiwis).

From the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 must be wearing high heels (since they are wearing sandals and cannot be wearing high heels, and the only remaining option is high heels).
- The person in house 2 must be drinking milk (since they are not drinking water and the only remaining option is milk).

Therefore, the person in house 1 is wearing high heels.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From Clue 2, we know that the person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other. Since there are only two houses, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Grapes, Sandals
- House 2: High heels, Television

From Clue 1, the person wearing high heels must be in House 1, and the person wearing sandals must be in House 2.

From Clue 3, the tea drinker must be in House 1, and the person with a television must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: High heels, Sandals, Tea drinker
- House 2: Grapes, Television

The person eating kiwis must be in House 1, as the only fruit left is kiwis.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the violinist must live in either house 1 or house 2.

3. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be exactly one house between them.

4. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot live in house 3, and the water drinker must live in house 2 or 3 if the cellist lives in house 1 or 2, respectively.

Let's test the possible placements:

- If the violinist is in house 1, then the guitarist must be in house 3 (since there is one house between them). This would place the cellist in house 2 (since the water drinker must be to the right of the cellist). This arrangement fits all the clues:
  - House 1: Tea drinker
  - House 2: Cellist
  - House 3: Water drinker

- If the violinist is in house 2, then the guitarist must be in house 4, but there is no house 4. So, this is not possible.

Therefore, the only valid arrangement is:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Water drinker

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house number for the person who only drinks water.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 7:
- The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
- The person who is wearing sandals also lives in the third house.

From Clue 3:
- The person who only drinks water lives directly to the right of the person who is wearing sandals, which means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 4:
- The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 6:
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the fifth house.

From Clue 5:
- There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. Since the third and fifth houses are occupied, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. Given the third house is occupied by the person who likes milk and the person who is wearing sandals, the only option left is that the coffee drinker lives in the first house and the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person wearing loafers
- House 3: Person wearing sandals and likes milk
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Tea drinker and person wearing boots

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the given clues step by step. Here are the clues again for reference:

1. The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
3. There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the known facts:

- From Clue 7, the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
- From Clue 6, the person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
- From Clue 8, the person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.

Since the person who had pizza lives in the fourth house, we can place that:

- House 4: Pizza

Now, let's use Clue 5: The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means:

- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Next, let's use Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives. This means:

- House 2: Radio

Now, we have:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Using Clue 1: The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. This means they must be in either House 1 and House 2, or House 2 and House 3, or House 3 and House 4, or House 4 and House 5. Since House 2 is already occupied by the radio, the only possible pairs are:

- House 1 and House 2 (not possible as House 2 is occupied)
- House 3 and House 4 (not possible as House 4 is occupied by pizza)
- House 4 and House 5 (not possible as House 5 is occupied by spaghetti)

Thus, the only possible pair is:

- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer

Now, we have:

- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Finally, we need to place the remaining devices (phone and television) and lunches (stew and fried rice) using the remaining clues:

- Clue 2: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
- Clue 4: There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.

Since House 1 has the gameboy, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3 (Grilled cheese) or House 5 (Spaghetti). But House 3 is already occupied by grilled cheese, so:

- House 5: Fried rice

This leaves:

- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

Now, the only remaining device is the phone, and the only remaining lunch is stew. Since the person who has a television must be to the left of the person who has a phone, and the only remaining house is House 1:

- House 1: Television
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in House 5.

The answer is (E) 3."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house 2, as the grilled cheese eater would then have to be in house 1, which would violate the clue.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must live in house 1.

Since the percussionist lives in house 1, the bird keeper cannot live in house 1. Given Clue 1, the bird keeper must live in house 2.

With the bird keeper in house 2, the grilled cheese eater must live in house 1 (since they live to the right of the bird keeper).

Thus, the pizza eater must live in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
The bird keeper lives in the third house (Option A).
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number. Let's break down the clues and use them step by step.

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Given that the cat lover lives in the first house, we can start by placing the cat lover in House 1.

- **House 1: Cat lover**

Now, let's use the clues to fill in the rest of the information:

- **Clue 5:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 8:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 6:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast. This means the flutist cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist. This means the person eating oranges cannot be in House 1 (since the cat lover is there).

- **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 4:** The history book buff does not live in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 3:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house. This means the person wearing loafers must be in House 1 or 3.

Given that the cat lover is in House 1, we can deduce the following:

- The fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3.
- The percussionist, history book buff, and fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 or 3.

Since the cat lover is in House 1, the only person who can be in House 2 is the person who is wearing running shoes (since the fish enthusiast, flutist, and person eating oranges must be in House 2 or 3).

- **House 2: Person wearing running shoes**

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The fish enthusiast must be in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the person who is eating a banana, and the person wearing running shoes is in House 2).

- The flutist must be in House 3 (since the flutist lives to the right of the fish enthusiast).

- The person eating oranges must be in House 3 (since the person eating oranges lives to the right of the pianist, and the pianist must be in House 1 or 2).

- The percussionist must be in House 1 (since the percussionist does not live in the second house and the cat lover is in House 1).

- The history book buff must be in House 3 (since the history book buff does not live in the second house and the flutist is in House 3).

- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in House 1 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the flutist and the cat lover is in House 1).

Finally, we can deduce the pets, musical instruments, and fruits:

- The cat lover (House 1) must be a history book buff, eating bananas, and wearing high heels.
- The person in House 2 (wearing running shoes) must be a percussionist, eating oranges, and a fish enthusiast.
- The person in House 3 (flutist) must be a fantasy book enthusiast, eating apples, and a cat lover.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is:

**(C) 3**"
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions of the people and their corresponding fruits and favorite colors.

1. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Grapes

2. **Clue 2 & Clue 5:** The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other, and there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - Since the person who likes green and the person who likes red are next to each other, and there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes red, the person who likes red must be in house 3, and the person who likes green must be in house 1.
   - House 1: Green
   - House 3: Red

3. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This confirms that the person who likes yellow is in house 4.
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.
   - House 1: Kiwis, Green

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 2, and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 4.
   - House 2: White, Grapes
   - House 4: Banana, Yellow

6. **Assigning the remaining fruit:**
   - The only fruit left is mango, which must be eaten by the person in house 3.
   - House 3: Red, Mango

Thus, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"To determine the house number where the person who had stew lives, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses.

Given Clue 1, the person eating oranges is in house 1. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in consecutive houses, with the mystery book reader in the left house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in house 2, the cat lover and the mystery book reader must be in house 1 and house 2, respectively.

From Clue 3, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in consecutive houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must also be in house 1.

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person with a phone.
2. The water drinker lives in the second house.
3. The root beer drinker lives in the first house.
4. The person with a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person with a television lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.

From clue 3, the first house has the root beer drinker and the vase of tulips.
From clue 2, the second house has the water drinker.
From clue 4, the television cannot be in the second house, so it must be in the third house.
From clue 5, the person with the television (in the third house) is to the right of the person with the vase of tulips (in the first house), which is consistent.

Now, the daffodils and phone must be in the first and third houses, but since the first house already has the vase of tulips, the daffodils must be in the third house, and the phone must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Root beer drinker, vase of tulips, phone
- House 2: Water drinker
- House 3: Daffodils, television

From clue 1, the daffodils and phone are adjacent, which fits our arrangement.

Therefore, the milk drinker must be in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."

1. **The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Loafers

2. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.**
   - This means the person with a phone cannot be in the third house, and the person eating mangos must be in a house to the right of the person with a phone.

3. **The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.**
   - This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses, with grapes in the left house.

4. **The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.**
   - House 3: Not boots

5. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.**
   - This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses, with kiwis in the left house.

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in the third house, and boots must be in a house to the right of the gameboy.

7. **The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.**
   - House 1: Not kiwis

Given these clues, let's start placing the information:

- From clue 1, House 1: Loafers
- From clue 7, House 1: Not kiwis
- From clue 3, grapes and water must be adjacent, and grapes must be in the left house. So, grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2.
- From clue 2, the person with a phone must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating mangos must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 5, kiwis and milk must be adjacent, and kiwis must be in House 2 or 3.
- From clue 4, boots cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of the gameboy.
- From clue 6, the gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be in House 2 or 3.

Given grapes in House 1 and water in House 2, and considering the constraints:
- House 1: Grapes, Loafers
- House 2: Water, Phone (since the phone must be to the left of mangos)
- House 3: Mangos, Computer (since boots cannot be in House 3 and gameboy cannot be in House 3, and boots must be to the right of gameboy)

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in House 3.

- The golfer and the baseball player are next to each other (Clue 3), so the golfer must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Baseball player

Next, let's place the flowers:

- The person with carnations must be to the left of the baseball player (Clue 5), so the person with carnations must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Horses
- House 3: Baseball player

Finally, let's place the pets:

- The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the person with horses (Clue 2), so the fish enthusiast must be in house 1.

   - This means the dog owner cannot be in House 3, and the bird keeper cannot be in House 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person eating mangos must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 is already occupied by oranges, the person eating mangos must be in House 2.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Horses

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

Now, we need to place the remaining occupants and their pets and cars:

- House 1: Oranges, Bird Keeper (since the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner, and the dog owner cannot be in House 3)
- House 2: Mangos, Convertible, Dog Owner (since the dog owner cannot be in House 3 and the bird keeper is in House 1)
- House 3: Horses, Truck

2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 3: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

2. **Clue 1: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 2, and the mystery book reader cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.**
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in house 2, and the cat lover cannot be in house 1.

### Possible Arrangements:
Given the constraints, let's consider the possible arrangements for the root beer lover and the guitarist:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1.

Let's test both scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Root Beer Lover in House 1, Guitarist in House 2
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement does not work because the cellist and the history book buff are both in house 1, which is not possible.

#### Scenario 2: Root Beer Lover in House 2, Guitarist in House 1
- The cellist cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
- The history book buff cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the history book buff must be in house 1.
- The cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), so the cat lover must be in house 2.

This arrangement works:
- House 1: Cellist, History book buff
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Cat lover, Root beer lover, Guitarist

### Conclusion:
The person who owns horses is the cat lover, and the cat lover lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is:
(B) 2"
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of houses, pets, and flowers.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Clue 2: The dog owner does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

2. **Clue 3: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - This means the dog owner cannot live in house 3 (because there is no house to the right of house 3). Therefore, the dog owner must live in house 1.
   - Consequently, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 1: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.**
   - Since the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper cannot be in house 1.
   - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 or house 3 and to the right of the bird keeper.

### Combining the Clues:
- The dog owner is in house 1.
- The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 or house 3 and to the right of the bird keeper.

Given these constraints:
- If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
- If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this is not possible.

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

### Final Arrangement:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Carnations arrangement

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner, they must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in house 2.

The answer is: (B) 2."

    - House 2: Eating banana

12. **Clue 12:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - House 1 or 2: Gameboy
    - House 2 or 3: Basketball player

From Clue 11, the person with a rose bouquet is in House 1, and the person with a banana is in House 2. Therefore, the person with loafers must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, fruits, and pets in each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Mangoes

2. **The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 1.

3. **The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are in consecutive houses.

4. **The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.**
   - Banana eater cannot be in House 3.

5. **The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.**
   - Horse owner cannot be in House 2.

6. **The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the banana eater is in a house to the left of the dog owner.

Let's start by placing the known information and use the clues to deduce the rest:

- **House 1:** Mangoes
- **House 2:** (Not horse owner, not banana eater, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 3:** (Not banana eater, not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)
- **House 4:** (Not horse owner, not kiwi eater, not bird keeper)

From clue 6, the banana eater is directly left of the dog owner. This means the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3, or the banana eater in House 3 and the dog owner in House 4. However, since the banana eater cannot be in House 3 (clue 4), the banana eater must be in House 2 and the dog owner in House 3.

- **House 2:** Banana
- **House 3:** Dog

From clue 3, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater are next to each other. Since the banana eater is in House 2 and the dog owner is in House 3, the bird keeper and kiwi eater must be in House 1 and House 4, or House 4 and House 1.

- **House 1:** Mangoes (from clue 1)
- **House 4:** Kiwi (since House 1 and House 4 are the only remaining options for the bird keeper and kiwi eater)

This leaves House 4 as the only place for the kiwi eater and House 1 as the only place for the bird keeper.

- **House 1:** Mangoes, Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Banana, Dog Owner
- **House 3:** Dog
- **House 4:** Kiwi

From clue 2, the horse owner cannot be in House 1 or House 2. Therefore, the horse owner must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 3 is already occupied by the dog owner, the horse owner must be in House 4.

- **House 4:** Kiwi, Horse Owner

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues and the setup, let's deduce the correct house for the romance book lover step-by-step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From clue 2, since the bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff, and the first house is already taken by the mystery book reader, the bird keeper must be in the second house and the history book buff in the third house.

From clue 3, the romance book lover cannot live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the history book buff, the romance book lover must be in the first or second house. However, the first house is already taken by the mystery book reader, so the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the history book buff, the horse owner must be in the first or second house. The first house is taken by the mystery book reader, so the horse owner must be in the second house, which is the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper is in the second house, the history book buff is in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first or third house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
5. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the coffee drinker is in the second house.

From clue 2, the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who only drinks water must be in the third house.

From clue 3, the person who is eating mangos cannot be in the first or third house, so they must be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples (in the first house) must be to the left of the tea drinker. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating apples, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the person who is eating mangos, so this clue is consistent with our current arrangement.

From clue 5, the person who is eating kiwis cannot be in the third house, so they must be in the first or fourth house. But the first house is occupied by the person eating apples, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fourth house. This conflicts with our previous deduction that the fourth house is occupied by the person who is eating mangos. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Given the constraints, the correct arrangement is:
1. Apples
2. Coffee
3. Water
4. MANGOES

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house. From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red, the person who likes red must live in the third house. However, the soccer player already lives in the third house, which means there's a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the clues.

Given clue 12, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house. This aligns with clue 7, confirming the soccer player lives in the third house.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. From clue 2, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who likes blue. Therefore, the person who likes blue must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person who likes white (second house) and the person who is eating apples. Therefore, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth house, which contradicts the person who likes blue living in the fourth house. This means we need to re-evaluate the positions.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house and the person who likes red lives in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house, which contradicts the person who likes white living in the second house. This means the person who is eating a banana must live in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, the cricketer must live in the fourth house, and the golfer must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the cricketer does not live in the fifth house, which is already confirmed.

So, the final arrangement is:
1. First house: Golfer
2. Second house: Person who likes white
3. Third house: Soccer player (and person who is eating a banana)
4. Fourth house: Cricketer
5. Fifth house: Person who likes green

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is (D) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics and house numbers of each person. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives in the second house.

Let's start by placing the soccer player in the second house (Clue 8):

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: ?

Next, let's use Clue 6: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 1 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: ?

Now, let's use Clue 4: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the soccer player, the mystery book reader must live in either House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must live in House 3.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti)
- House 3: Mystery book reader

Next, let's use Clue 5: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the soccer player is in House 2, the person who had stew must be in House 1 or House 3. But House 1 already has the rose bouquet, so the person who had stew must be in House 3, and the history book buff must be in House 2.

- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Now, let's use Clue 1: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing high heels must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader

Next, let's use Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2 or House 3. But House 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the golfer must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Soccer player (and Spaghetti, History book buff)
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, let's use Clue 2: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives. Since the golfer is in House 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 already has the high heels, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Finally, let's use Clue 7: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in House 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

- House 1: High heels
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

Now, we have all the characteristics assigned to each house:

- House 1: High heels, Rose bouquet
- House 2: Running shoes, Daffodils, Spaghetti, History book buff
- House 3: Stew, Mystery book reader, Golfer

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 2.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses, the people, their musical instruments, shoes, devices, and cars.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by placing the minivan and truck based on Clue 2 and Clue 5. Since the minivan must be to the right of the truck, and the truck and gameboy are adjacent (Clue 2), the only possible arrangement is:
- Truck in house 1
- Gameboy in house 2
- Minivan in house 3

From Clue 3, the minivan and cellist are adjacent, so the cellist must be in house 2. This conflicts with the gameboy being in house 2, so we need to adjust. The only way to satisfy all conditions is:
- Truck in house 1
- Gameboy in house 2
- Minivan in house 3
- Cellist in house 2 (this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate)

Re-evaluating, we place:
- Truck in house 1
- Gameboy in house 2
- Minivan in house 3
- Cellist in house 1 (to satisfy Clue 3)

Now, the flutist lives directly left of the minivan (Clue 6), so the flutist must be in house 1. This conflicts with the cellist being in house 1, so we need to re-evaluate again.

Correct placement:
- Truck in house 1
- Gameboy in house 2
- Minivan in house 3
- Cellist in house 2 (this is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate)

Re-evaluating correctly:
- Truck in house 1
- Gameboy in house 2
- Minivan in house 3
- Cellist in house 1 (to satisfy Clue 3)

Now, the flutist lives directly left of the minivan (Clue 6), so the flutist must be in house 1. This conflicts with the cellist being in house 1, so we need to re-evaluate again.

Correct placement:
- Truck in house 1
- Gameboy in house 2
- Minivan in house 3
- Cellist in house 2 (to satisfy Clue 3)

The high heels and television are adjacent (Clue 4), and the boots are to the right of the percussionist (Clue 7). Since the flutist is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 3 (the only remaining house).

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who is eating apples lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 4"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Lilies

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in a house to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in a house to the right of the person with the SUV.

From Clues 2 and 3, we can infer that the coffee drinker must be in House 3, because the person with the SUV must be in House 1 and the person with the rose bouquet must be in House 2.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person who drives a truck cannot be in House 1, and the person who drives a minivan cannot be in House 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in House 3, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2 or 3.

Given that the coffee drinker is in House 3, and the person with the SUV is in House 1, the root beer lover must be in House 2 (since the person with the SUV is in House 1 and the coffee drinker is in House 3).

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house number.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

Let's break it down step by step:

- From Clue 4, the person who drives a minivan lives in house 1, and the person who had stew lives in house 2.
- From Clue 6, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 3.
- From Clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1, and the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.
- From Clue 1, the person who likes blue lives in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person who had stew (house 2) lives to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3).
- From Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3.

Summarizing the findings:
- House 1: Rose bouquet, likes blue, drives a minivan
- House 2: Ate spaghetti, likes red
- House 3: Truck, likes green, has a bouquet of daffodils

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's start by organizing the clues and deducing the information step by step.

1. The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. The basketball player lives in the fourth house and owns an SUV.
3. The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house.
6. The soccer player lives in the second house.
7. The flutist lives in the third house.
8. The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
10. The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other.
11. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house.
12. The person who likes green does not live in the third house.
13. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
14. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
15. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist (from Clue 7 and Clue 10).
- House 1: The remaining person, who must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.

Since the cellist and the flutist live next to each other, and the flutist is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2 or 4. But house 2 is occupied by the soccer player, so the cellist must be in house 4, and the flutist must be in house 3.

- House 1: The remaining person, who must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player.
- House 3: Flutist.
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white.

Now, we need to place the lunch and car information:

- House 1: The remaining person, who must be the saxophonist or the person who likes red and owns a sedan.
- House 2: Soccer player, owns a sedan, ate pizza (since the stew and pizza eaters are next to each other, and the stew eater cannot be in house 4).
- House 3: Flutist, owns a convertible, ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player, and the tennis player cannot be in house 4).
- House 4: Basketball player, SUV owner, likes white, ate stew (since the stew eater cannot be in house 4).

The person who owns a sedan lives in house 2.

   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person with the phone and the person with running shoes must be in consecutive houses.

4. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in the third house, and the person who is eating grapes must be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

5. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in the second house, the person who is eating grapes must be in the third house.
   - House 3: Grapes

6. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses that are two apart.

From the above, we can place the characteristics as follows:

- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White (from Clue 4 and Clue 6)
- House 2: Red (from Clue 5)
- House 1: Must be the remaining characteristics.

Since the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be two houses apart, and the person who is eating grapes is in the third house, the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Must be the person who is eating apples and wearing sandals.
- House 2: Red, must be the person who is wearing sandals.
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White.

Now, the person who has a phone must be in house 1, as the person with the phone is directly left of the person with running shoes, and house 2 is already taken by red.

- House 1: Phone, Apples, Sandals
- House 2: Red, Sandals
- House 3: Gameboy, Grapes, White

Thus, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues and the setup of the problem, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **The bird keeper lives in the second house.**
   - This directly places the bird keeper in house 2.

2. **The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.**
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the lilies must be in a house to the left of the violinist.

3. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the pizza eater must be in a house to the right of the guitarist.

4. **There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.**
   - This means the violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.**
   - This means the tulips and the dog are in consecutive houses.

6. **The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.**
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the spaghetti eater must be in a house to the left of the saxophonist.

7. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.**
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in a house to the left of the guitarist.

8. **The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.**
   - Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 or 4.

9. **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**
   - This directly places the horse owner in house 4.

10. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.**
    - This directly places the grilled cheese eater in house 1.

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 4: Horse owner

Using the remaining clues:
- The violinist and the rose bouquet person are 2 houses apart.
- The person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the saxophonist.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.

Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti).

This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti and house 4 for the horse owner. Therefore, the violinist and the rose bouquet person must be in house 1 and house 3, respectively, or house 3 and house 1, respectively. But since house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater, the violinist must be in house 3 and the rose bouquet person in house 1.

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulips must be in house 1 and the dog in house 2.

Finally, the person who had pizza lives to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in house 4, so the guitarist must be in house 3, and the pizza eater in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese eater, tulips, bird keeper
- House 2: Dog owner, bird keeper
- House 3: Violinist, rose bouquet
- House 4: Horse owner, pizza

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in House 1, the golfer must be in House 2.
3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the baseball player must be in House 1, and the person eating grapes must be in House 2.
4. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in House 2, the tea drinker must be in House 1.
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other. Since the golfer is in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, romance book lover, saxophonist, and baseball player.
- House 2: Person eating grapes, golfer, and science fiction book fanatic.

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is a tea drinker and a romance book lover.
- The person in House 2 is a science fiction book fanatic and eats grapes.

The only person left to be a percussionist is the one in House 1, and the only person left to eat mangos is the one in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

4. **House 2: Oranges** (since the person eating oranges is directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast)
5. **House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast** (since the person eating oranges is directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast)
6. **Green and Blue: Green must be in a house to the left of blue, and there are no other constraints that directly place them yet.**
7. **Yellow and High Heels: Yellow is directly left of high heels, so Yellow must be in House 2 and High Heels in House 4.**
8. **Pianist and Sandals: There are two houses between where the pianist lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. This means the pianist and sandals cannot be in adjacent houses.**
9. **Grapes and History: Grapes must be to the left of the history book buff.**
10. **Saxophonist and Percussionist: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**
11. **Science Fiction and Cellist: They live directly next to each other.**

Let's place the known items:

- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Oranges
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: Apples
- House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- **Green and Blue**: Since green must be to the left of blue, and considering the other constraints, green can be in House 1 or 2, and blue in House 2 or 3. Given that oranges are in House 2, green must be in House 1 and blue in House 3.
- **Yellow and High Heels**: Yellow is in House 2 and High Heels in House 4.
- **Pianist and Sandals**: Since there are two houses between the pianist and sandals, and considering the other constraints, the pianist can be in House 1 or 3, and sandals in House 3 or 5. Given the other placements, the pianist must be in House 3 and sandals in House 5.
- **Grapes and History**: Grapes must be to the left of the history book buff. Given the other placements, grapes must be in House 3 and history in House 5.
- **Saxophonist and Percussionist**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Given the other placements, the saxophonist must be in House 2 and the percussionist in House 4.

"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place the characteristics of each person in their respective houses based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 2**: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Golfer

3. **Clue 9**: The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who had pizza must live in a house to the left of the basketball player.

4. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the percussionist must live in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

5. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the saxophonist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be two houses in between them.

6. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the soccer player and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover cannot live in the first house (since the first house has spaghetti), and the person who likes white must live in a house to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 7**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in a house to the right of the person who likes blue.

9. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic and the person who likes red cannot be in adjacent houses, and there must be one house in between them.

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first, second, or fourth house.

11. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - This means the violinist and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

Let's start placing the known information and use the clues to fill in the rest:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 4: Golfer

Since the golfer is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza and the percussionist must be in the second and third houses, respectively, because the person who had pizza is directly left of the percussionist.

- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the other characteristics:

- The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, so the romance book lover cannot live in the first house. The only possible positions are the second and third houses, but the second house is already taken by the pizza eater. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the second house.

- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 3: Percussionist (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 2: Person who likes white

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue. The only remaining houses are the first and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti, the person who likes green must be in the first house, and the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

- House 1: Spaghetti (already placed)
- House 4: Golfer (already placed)
- House 3: Romance book lover (already placed)
- House 2: Pizza (already placed)
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 4: Person who likes blue

Now, we need to place the sports and books:

- The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house. The only remaining houses are the first, second, and fourth houses. Since the first house has spaghetti and the fourth house has the golfer, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the second house.

- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the second house, and the person who had pizza is in the third house.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in:

**House 3**

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues and the setup, let's analyze the positions step by step:

1. The basketball player lives in the second house.
2. The violinist lives in the second house.

These two clues seem contradictory, so we need to interpret them correctly. Since a person can only live in one house, the clues must be referring to different characteristics. Let's assume the second house is occupied by the violinist, and the basketball player must be in either the first or third house.

3. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.

This means the cricketer cannot be in the third house, and the cellist must be in the second or third house. Since the violinist is in the second house, the cellist must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Now, the basketball player must be in the first house because the second and third houses are already occupied.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics correctly for each house. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the coffee drinker.**
   - This means the coffee drinker is in house 2 and the person who likes green is in house 1.

2. **The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.**
   - The mystery book reader is in house 4.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.**
   - This confirms the person who only drinks water is in house 4, and the mystery book reader is also in house 4.

4. **The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**
   - This means the history book buff is in house 3 and the person with lilies is in house 4.

5. **The person who likes white does not live in the third house.**
   - The person who likes white is not in house 3.

6. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.**
   - The person with daffodils is not in house 1.

7. **The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.**
   - The person with carnations is not in house 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.**
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1 or 2, and the person with carnations is in house 3 or 4. Since the person with carnations is not in house 4, the tea drinker must be in house 1 and the person with carnations is in house 3.

9. **The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.**
   - This means the person who likes red is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 2. But we already know the tea drinker is in house 1, so this is consistent.

10. **The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.**
    - Since the mystery book reader is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 3.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 1: Tea drinker, likes red
- House 2: Coffee drinker, likes green
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, has carnations
- House 4: Mystery book reader, drinks water

The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in house 2, which is the coffee drinker.

So, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze and place each characteristic in the correct house based on the given clues. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
2. The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the fourth house.
4. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
5. The guitarist does not live in the third house.

9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
10. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clues 2, 3, and 11, we can place the coffee drinker, flutist, and horse owner in the fourth house:
- House 4: Coffee drinker, Flutist, Horse owner

From clue 4, the tennis player cannot be in the fourth house, so the tennis player must be in one of the first three houses.

From clue 10, the tennis player and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Since the tennis player is not in the fourth house, the only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in one of the following pairs:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

From clue 7, the guitarist lives to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the guitarist. The only possible pairs are:
- House 1 and House 2
- House 2 and House 3

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house, so the cricketer must be in House 1 and the guitarist in House 2.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house, so the violinist must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the cricketer is in House 1, the violinist must be in House 2.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player. The only possible pairs are:
- House 2 and House 3
- House 3 and House 4

Since the violinist is in House 2, the fish enthusiast must be in House 3, and the basketball player must be in House 2.

From clue 1, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, so the person who likes milk must be in House 1 or House 2. Since the violinist is in House 2, the person who likes milk must be in House 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues:
1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the pianist live directly next to each other.
2. The pianist lives in the second house.

Since the pianist is in house 2, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1, as they are next to each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the people, fruits, cars, and flowers in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Oranges

2. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Banana

3. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4.

4. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: SUV

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3, the person with apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person with daffodils is in House 3 and the person with the minivan is in House 4, the person with the convertible must be in House 5.
   - Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in House 2.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - Since House 2 is occupied by apples and tulips, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 1 (oranges) or House 3 (daffodils). But House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in House 3.
   - Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 4 or House 5. But House 4 is already occupied by the SUV, so the person who owns a sedan must be in House 5.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in House 3, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 5.
   - House 1 is already occupied by oranges, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 5.

Now, let's summarize the arrangement:
- House 1: Oranges, Vase of Tulips
- House 2: Apples, Bouquet of Daffodils
- House 3: Daffodils, Minivan
- House 4: Banana, SUV
- House 5: Lilies, Convertible

The person who owns a sedan lives in House 5.

Therefore, the answer is:
(E) 5"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the root beer lover step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the root beer lover.
   - This means if the root beer lover is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 2 (since the root beer lover must be to the right of them).

4. **Clue 4:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the romance book lover is in house 2. Since the soccer player is also in house 2 (Clue 4), the romance book lover cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 2, and the soccer player must be in house 2.

Since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 3), and the root beer lover cannot be in house 1 (because the person who likes blue would then be in house 1, which is not possible as the root beer lover is to the right of the grilled cheese eater), the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

From Clue 6:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
- House 1: Yellow

From Clue 7:
- The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
- Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes red must be in House 3.

From Clue 5:
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
- Since the person who likes red is in House 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 11:
- The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
- Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is in House 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 9:
- The person who has a vase of tulips and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
- Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in House 3, the baseball player must be in House 4.

- Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes white must be in House 2, 3, 4, or 5. But House 2, 4, and 5 are already occupied, so the person who likes white must be in House 3, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in House 4.

From Clue 3:
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
- Since the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes green must be in House 1, 2, or 3. But House 1 and 2 are already occupied, so the person who likes green must be in House 3, and the swimmer must be in House 4.

From Clue 2:
- The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player.
- Since the soccer player cannot be in House 4 (Clue 1) and the cricketer must be to the right of the soccer player, the soccer player must be in House 5, and the cricketer must be in House 1.

Thus, the swimmer lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person with a computer lives to the left of the bird keeper.

1. **House 1: Gameboy, Rose Bouquet**
2. **House 2: Boots**
3. **House 4: Pizza**
4. **House 3: TV**

From clue 14, the carnations arrangement lives left of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 5, and the carnations arrangement must be in one of the first four houses, we can place the carnations arrangement in House 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 13, the loafers live directly left of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be in House 3, and the person with loafers must be in House 2.

From clue 16, the running shoes and computer live next to each other. Since the computer is in House 3, the running shoes must be in House 2.

From clue 18, the computer is right of the daffodils. Since the computer is in House 3, the daffodils must be in House 2.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From clue 1:
- House 2: Boots

From clue 4:
- Since the person in House 2 is wearing boots, the person in House 1 must be wearing an SUV.

From clue 5:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV

From clue 3:
- The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

From clue 2:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 1 and the SUV is in House 1, the person in House 1 cannot be the dog owner. Therefore, the dog owner must be in House 3, and the person in House 2 must be wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover, SUV
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Dog owner, Sedan

The only remaining shoe type is running shoes, which must be worn by the person in House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and place the characteristics in the correct houses. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the person who likes blue is in the third house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. But since the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in the first and third houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**
   - Since the tea drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating oranges must be in the first or second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Green
- House 2: Boots, Tulips, Blue
- House 3: Tea drinker, Kiwis

Since the person who is eating apples is next to the person who likes milk, and the person who likes milk is next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating kiwis is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 1**.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From clue 2, we know:
- The mystery book reader is in house 1.

From clue 1, since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 3 (directly to the right of the mystery book reader).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 4, the mystery book reader (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who has a television. Therefore, the person with a television must be in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Television
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since house 2 has the television and house 3 has the history book buff, the only remaining device is a computer, which must be in house 2 (since it's to the right of the phone).

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining device is a phone, which must be in house 1.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader (with a phone)
- House 2: Television (and computer)
- House 3: History book buff

The only remaining book type is science fiction, which must be the book type of the person in house 2.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

St. Vitus's Dance, or Sydenham's chorea, involves involuntary, irregular, and often jerky movements. These symptoms would make it extremely challenging for a person to perform the precise and controlled movements required in a ballet competition. Therefore, someone with this condition would likely not win such a competition."

"(A) No

The Olympiastadion Berlin, which hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics, had a seating capacity of around 100,000 spectators. While this capacity is impressive, it is generally not sufficient to accommodate the large crowds that typically attend a Super Bowl event. The Super Bowl often draws audiences in the millions, both in person and through television viewership. Therefore, the 1936 Summer Olympics venue would not be large enough for a Super Bowl crowd."

Growing seedless cucumbers can be challenging for a gardener with entomophobia because these cucumbers often require specific conditions to prevent pollination, which might involve managing the environment to avoid insect activity. This could still involve some interaction with the plants and potentially with insects, which might be distressing for someone with entomophobia."
"(A) Yes

Given that Martin Luther wrote 95 theses in total, if he were to write one thesis per day, he would run out of theses after 95 days. Since half a year is approximately 182.5 days, he would indeed run out of theses well before reaching half a year."
"(A) No

Waltz and slam dance both involve physical movement, but slam dance typically includes more vigorous and potentially uncontrolled movements, which could make it more prone to injury compared to the more structured and controlled nature of waltz. However, the risk of injury in any dance depends on various factors such as the skill level of the participants and the environment."
"(B) No

A 1943-S penny, being an alloy of copper, silver, and manganese, is not suitable for making silverware. Silverware requires a high purity of silver to meet quality and hygiene standards, and the presence of other metals would compromise its functionality and appearance. Additionally, using coins for such purposes is illegal and not practical due to the value of the coins themselves."
"(B) Yes

Snowboarding on Venus would be extremely difficult due to its harsh environmental conditions. The high surface pressure and extreme temperatures make it impossible for snowboarding as we know it on Earth."

In the context of tracking shuffled objects, Apollo's divine abilities would provide significant advantages over human fighters like D'Artagnan. Apollo could manipulate the environment and his opponents in ways that would be extremely difficult for human fighters to counter. While D'Artagnan is a skilled swordsman, the sheer range and unpredictability of Apollo's powers would make it challenging for any number of D'Artagnan figures to defeat him."
"(A) No

Sunscreen is not unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley. Melanoma, the type of skin cancer he suffered from, is often linked to UV exposure. Sunscreen helps protect the skin from harmful UV rays, which can reduce the risk of developing skin cancers. Therefore, sunscreen is an important tool in skin cancer prevention."

The French Defense, characterized by the moves 1.e4 e6, is designed to establish a solid position and control the center. It does not provide a defense against a four-move checkmate, which typically occurs in the opening moves with 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5+ g6 3.Qf3+ Qf6 4.Qxf6#. This sequence is not relevant to the French Defense and would not arise from the typical development of the French Defense."

A dichromat would not be able to distinguish between chlorine gas and neon gas based on color, as both gases are colorless. Dichromacy affects the ability to perceive certain colors, but it does not provide the ability to see colorless gases differently.

"The answer is (B) No.

Jesus lived in a time and context very different from our modern world. The Easter Bunny is a relatively recent addition to Easter celebrations, originating in Germanic and later German-American traditions. Given that Jesus lived around 2,000 years ago, he would not have been familiar with the concept of the Easter Bunny. Therefore, it is unlikely that Jesus would understand the Easter Bunny."

"(A) No

Ethanol, the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, is generally not beneficial to health, especially in excessive amounts. For Jack Kerouac, known for his heavy drinking, alcohol likely contributed to various health issues, including liver problems. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that ethanol was beneficial to his health."
"(A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not necessarily blue. The cost of a color can vary greatly depending on the specific pigment, material, and application. For instance, certain rare pigments like lapis lazuli, used in ultramarine, have been historically very expensive. However, this does not make blue the most expensive color in all contexts. Other colors, such as gold or silver, can be more expensive in certain applications. Therefore, the statement that blue is the most expensive color in the world is not accurate."
"(B) No

Ryan Crouser, while an incredibly strong athlete, would not throw a Bengal fox with ease. The act of throwing a small animal like a fox is not within the scope of his athletic focus and would not be performed with the necessary control and safety."

Sea shanties were associated with maritime activities and were sung by sailors on ships. The Oregon Trail was a land route used by settlers, so travelers would have sung songs more relevant to their overland journey, such as ballads or folk songs, rather than sea shanties."
"(A) Yes

Shooting a bald eagle can result in severe legal penalties, including up to two years in prison. This is due to the protection afforded to bald eagles under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. In comparison, Michael Vick's sentence for his involvement in dogfighting was 23 months. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, shooting a bald eagle could indeed result in more prison time than Michael Vick's sentence."
"(B) No

Given that Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, and television was not invented until the 1920s, it is impossible for him to have watched Bonanza, which first aired in 1959."

Given the available public information, there is no documented evidence of such an offense. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No."
"(B) No

Mental disorders can be challenging to hide, even from the individual experiencing them. Symptoms such as changes in behavior, mood, and thought processes are often noticeable to others. While some people may be skilled at managing their symptoms, the nature of mental health conditions typically makes them difficult to conceal entirely. Seeking help from a mental health professional is often the best approach to managing and treating these conditions effectively."
"(A) Yes

Paul Bunyan, with his immense size and strength, would likely struggle with the intricate and precise nature of urban planning. His methods would probably be too destructive and inefficient for managing the delicate balance required in urban environments. Therefore, he would be a poor choice for an urban planner."
"(A) Yes

Parsley can be found in multiple sections of a grocery store because it is available both as fresh produce and as a dried spice. Fresh parsley is typically located in the produce section, while dried parsley is usually in the spice aisle. This dual availability explains why you might find parsley in more than one section."
"(A) No

Given the dimensions of Alcatraz Island and a standard football field, it would not be possible to fit a full-sized football field on the island without significant portions of the island being unused or overlapping."
"(A) No

Kaffir lime would not be a suitable addition to a White Russian. The flavors in a White Russian—vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream—are well-balanced and traditional. Kaffir lime's unique and strong citrus and floral notes would likely disrupt this balance and are not typically paired with these ingredients."
"(A) Yes

If a Goblin shark hypothetically had limbs, it could potentially ride a bike. While a Goblin shark is adapted for life in the deep sea, with the right modifications to its anatomy and physiology, it might be able to support its body weight and manipulate the bike's controls. However, this scenario is highly speculative and assumes significant biological and environmental adaptations."

"(B) No

A spice grinder can still be useful for grinding even the cheapest cinnamon sticks. The primary function of a spice grinder is to break down the cinnamon into smaller pieces, which can enhance its flavor and aroma in cooking. The quality and cost of the cinnamon sticks may affect the grind's texture and aroma, but the grinder itself will still effectively break down the cinnamon."
"(B) No

A slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. While both slingshots and artillery involve launching projectiles, they differ significantly in terms of their design, range, and operational principles. Artillery typically refers to large, powerful weapons used in military applications, capable of firing explosive shells over long distances. Slingshots, being small and handheld, use elastic material to launch smaller projectiles over shorter to medium distances. Therefore, a slingshot is correctly classified as a type of projectile weapon but not as artillery."

"(B) No

Dafne Keen is an actress and not a singer, so she would not be eligible to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. The contest requires participants to have a background in singing or be actively involved in the music industry."
"(A) Yes

Iris and Hermes, from Greek mythology, would likely struggle with the specific tasks involved in a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and a messenger of the gods, excelled in swift and efficient communication but her role didn't involve the physical aspects of package delivery. Similarly, Hermes, known for his speed and role as a messenger, would find the structured and regulated environment of a UPS job challenging, especially given his trickster nature and the diverse range of tasks required in modern logistics. Their mythological roles and personalities might make them less suited to the structured and regulated tasks of a UPS job."
"(A) No

Cookie Monster's diet, which consists mainly of cookies, does not align with the Paleo diet. The Paleo diet focuses on whole, unprocessed foods like meats, fish, fruits, and vegetables, while avoiding processed foods and grains.

"(A) Yes

The main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" Alice, could potentially join a Masonic Lodge if she were an adult and met the specific requirements of the Lodge. The Masonic Lodge is open to men who are of good character and meet the age and other membership criteria set by the particular Lodge or Grand Lodge. Since Alice is a fictional character, for the sake of this hypothetical scenario, if she were an adult and a man, she would be eligible to join a Masonic Lodge."
"(B) No

Bull sharks and crocodiles both have powerful bites, but crocodiles are known to exert significantly more force. Crocodiles can generate pressures of over 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi), whereas bull sharks typically exert around 1,000 psi.

"(A) Yes

The acceptability of wearing an icon depicting crucifixion can vary based on the context. In some religious settings or among certain communities, such an icon might be widely accepted as a symbol of faith. However, in more secular or diverse environments, it could be seen as controversial or inappropriate.

"Placozoa are a unique phylum of simple animals that lack a nervous system. Since they do not have the ability to learn or process information in a way that would allow for learning disabilities, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"(B) Yes

Given that Bart Simpson is a character within the ""Simpsons"" universe and that universe frequently includes references to various comic book characters, it is entirely plausible for Bart to own comics featuring The Joker. Comic books are a common element in the show, and the inclusion of characters from other universes, like The Joker from DC Comics, is not uncommon in crossover storylines or guest appearances."
"(A) Yes

To provide a more detailed explanation, while I am an expert in tracking shuffled objects, this expertise does not directly apply to personal relationships. However, based on publicly available information, 50 Cent (Curtis James Jackson III) and Jeffrey Atkins (also known as Method Man) are both members of the Wu-Tang Clan. They have a history of collaboration in the music industry, which suggests they likely maintain a positive relationship. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that they get along."
"(A) No

In the context of tracking shuffled objects, the scenario of a celibate cleric facing a stoning in Somalia does not align with the typical tasks or areas of expertise in this field. Tracking shuffled objects involves monitoring and identifying the movement and distribution of items, which is unrelated to legal or cultural practices in Somalia. Therefore, the likelihood of a celibate cleric suffering a stoning is not a matter of tracking shuffled objects but rather a legal and social issue."
"(B) Yes

The Riksdag is a political entity in Sweden, which is part of Scandinavia. It serves as the national legislature of the country."
"(A) No

Spaghetti should not be slick when cooked. Properly cooked spaghetti should have a slight firmness to it (al dente) and should not be overly soft or sticky. A slick texture suggests the pasta may have been overcooked or cooked in too much water, which can cause it to lose its shape and become mushy."
"(B) Yes

Isaac Newton is often associated with a red apple, which is a common depiction in stories and illustrations. This association is due to the legend of the apple falling from a tree and inspiring Newton's thoughts on gravity."
"(A) No

Therefore, while he might have survived, the circumstances would have been very different."
"(B) No

A unanimously elected president's birthday is not typically designated as a break or holiday for mail carriers. Federal holidays are established by the U.S. government and do not usually include individual officials' birthdays. Mail carriers generally continue to work on most days, including those that might be recognized as holidays for other purposes."
"(A) No

Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that affects reading, writing, and spelling abilities, but it is not classified as an intellectual disability.

"(B) No

John Kerry did not participate in the 2010 United Kingdom general election. As an expert in tracking objects, my focus would be on identifying and following specific items or entities, but in this case, the relevant ""object"" is John Kerry's political involvement, which is clearly not aligned with UK electoral activities during that time."
"(A) Yes

Binary numbers and the standard alphabet can both be used to create strong passwords. A strong password typically includes a mix of different character types, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Both binary numbers (0s and 1s) and the standard alphabet (A-Z, a-z) can contribute to the complexity of a password when combined with other character types. Therefore, they can satisfy the criteria for a strong password."
"(A) No

Spotting a full circle of a rainbow is not a common or easily achievable activity, especially by simply being on a beach. Rainbows typically appear as semi-circular arcs in the sky, and a full circle can only be observed under specific conditions where the sun is at a low angle (below about 42 degrees) and the observer is positioned at the exact anti-solar point. These conditions are not easily met by simply having lunch on a beach."
"(A) Yes

Abdulqawi Yusuf, as the President of the International Criminal Court, would typically conduct his work from The Hague, where the ICC is headquartered. Therefore, on a typical work day, he would go to The Hague."
"(A) No

"(A) No

Given that the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit ceased operations in 2010, any broadcast from it would not be newsworthy in 2020."
"(B) Yes

Pancakes are not a suitable snack for cats. Cats are obligate carnivores and their diet should primarily consist of animal-based proteins.

You don't need different colored pens for solving a Sudoku puzzle. While using various colors can be helpful for tracking and organizing your thoughts, it is not necessary for solving the puzzle itself. A single pen or pencil is sufficient."
"(B) No

The religions that consider the Himalayas to be sacred, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, have much older origins. Hinduism dates back to the Vedic period around 1500 BCE, and Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the 5th century BCE. Therefore, these religions did not originate in the 19th century."
"(A) Yes

White rice and sesame seeds can both spoil, but they do so through different mechanisms. Sesame seeds contain fats and oils that can oxidize and lead to rancidity, especially if exposed to air, light, or heat. In contrast, white rice, being primarily composed of carbohydrates, does not undergo rancidity in the same way. Therefore, sesame seeds are more prone to going rancid than white rice."
"(B) No

Penicillin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections and does not address learning disabilities. These disabilities are related to cognitive processing and do not have a cure. Treatment for learning disabilities typically involves educational strategies, therapies, and support systems."

This could trigger a hedgehog's caution and avoidance response.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"(A) No

The iPhone, while a groundbreaking technological device, did not initiate a scientific revolution. A scientific revolution typically refers to a period of significant transformation in scientific thought and methodology, which occurred historically. The iPhone, instead, revolutionized personal technology and communication, but it did not fundamentally alter the way science is practiced or understood."
"(B) No

Handedness does not determine how you use American Sign Language (ASL). While it can influence the dominant hand used in signing, it does not dictate the specific signs or their execution. ASL is a visual-gestural language that is learned and used based on visual cues, and its use is not tied to handedness. Factors such as individual signing style, context, and familiarity with ASL play a more significant role in how ASL is used."
"(A) No

Purchasing food for a Lolcat is necessary to ensure it receives proper nutrition and stays healthy. Just like any other cat, a Lolcat requires a balanced diet to maintain its well-being."
"(A) No

Garfield, being a cat with a distinct preference for his favorite food, lasagna, would not enjoy canid food, which is designed for dogs. His dietary preferences make it highly unlikely that he would like canid food."
"(A) No

Silicon wedding rings are a known and popular choice in the market, whereas bromine is a chemical element that is not used in jewelry production due to its reactivity and toxicity. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that silicon wedding rings would be outsold by bromine wedding rings, as the latter do not exist in the market."
"(A) Yes

The song ""YMCA"" by the Village People is well-known and often associated with a specific hand movement routine. When the song is mentioned, it's common for people to start singing or mimicking these movements, making it a normal and expected reaction."
"(B) No

In the context of aviation disasters, United Airlines has been involved in several incidents where the airline was found to be at fault or partially responsible. For instance, the crash of United Airlines Flight 826 in 1977 was attributed to pilot error, for which the airline was held accountable. Therefore, it would be incorrect to claim that United Airlines was blameless in all worst crashes in history."
"(A) No

The Liberty Bell is not in its original location. After serving for many years in Independence Hall, it was moved to a new pavilion on Independence Square in 1976 to better preserve and protect the bell for future generations."

Additionally, it would be inappropriate to use such valuable and significant awards in a recreational activity."
"(A) No

A beaver's teeth and a Smilodon's teeth serve distinct purposes. Beavers have strong, continuously growing incisors designed for cutting wood, while Smilodon had long, sharp canine teeth for slicing through the flesh of their prey. Therefore, a beaver's teeth would not rival those of a Smilodon in size or function."
"(B) Yes, the rise of agriculture is often attributed to rivers because many early agricultural societies developed in river valleys. These regions provided essential resources like a reliable water supply, fertile soil from annual flooding, and transportation routes. Rivers played a crucial role in the development of agriculture, making these areas ideal for farming."
"(A) No

While art education is often included in U.S. schools, it is not universally prioritized. The emphasis on core subjects like math, reading, and science for standardized testing and college admissions has sometimes led to reduced funding and support for arts programs.

The question about Sugar Ray Robinson boxing in Iran, especially in the context of him stealing, doesn't align with the expertise in tracking shuffled objects. However, if we interpret the question as asking whether a boxer could box in Iran regardless of any legal issues, the answer would be (B) Yes.

"(B) No

Woodrow Wilson would not have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision, which upheld the ""separate but equal"" doctrine.

Therefore, it would not be a ""piece of cake"" for him."
"(B) No

A Bengal cat, while incredibly agile and strong for its size, does not possess the physical capabilities to compete in pole vaulting or any event that requires human-level strength and height. The world record for pole vaulting set by Javier Sotomayor is 2.45 meters (8 feet 0.25 inches), which is well beyond the reach of any cat. Therefore, a Bengal cat could not hypothetically best Javier Sotomayor's record."
"(A) Yes

"(B) Yes

Fish can indeed develop infections or inflammation in their throat or mouth areas, which might be similar to tonsillitis in humans.
