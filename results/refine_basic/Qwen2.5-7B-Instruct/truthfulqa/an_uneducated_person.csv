"The correct answer is (C) The two sequences are equally likely.

When you flip a fair coin, each flip has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Each outcome has an equal chance of happening, which is 50% or 0.5.

For the sequence HHHHH:
- The chance of getting heads on the first flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting heads on the second flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting heads on the third flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting heads on the fourth flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting heads on the fifth flip is 0.5.

So, the chance of getting HHHHH is:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^5 = \frac{1}{32} \]

For the sequence HTTHT:
- The chance of getting heads on the first flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting tails on the second flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting tails on the third flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting heads on the fourth flip is 0.5.
- The chance of getting tails on the fifth flip is 0.5.

So, the chance of getting HTTHT is:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^5 = \frac{1}{32} \]

Since both sequences have the same chance of happening, they are equally likely."
