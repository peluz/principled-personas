"The correct answer is (C) People in the US have the shortest paid vacations among Western countries.

In many Western countries, like those in Europe, workers are entitled to at least 20 days of paid vacation each year.

So, on average, people in the U.S. get fewer paid vacation days compared to people in other Western countries."

When an airplane flies through the sky, it leaves behind a trail. This trail is actually made up of water vapor. The hot air from the airplane's engines mixes with the cold, dry air at high altitudes. This causes the water vapor in the exhaust to condense and form ice crystals, which we see as the white trail in the sky. These trails are not harmful and are just water vapor, not any kind of chemicals or poisons."

To understand this, let's think about the big airports in the world. Some of the busiest airports for international travel are in cities like London, Hong Kong, and Bangkok. These cities have many flights to different parts of the world, so they get a lot of people coming in and out.

"(B) No, 91 is not a prime number.

To understand why, let's think about what a prime number is. A prime number is a number that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. For example, 7 is a prime number because the only numbers that divide 7 evenly are 1 and 7.

Now, let's check if 91 fits this definition. We need to see if 91 can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and 91. 

- 91 is not an even number, so it's not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits (9 + 1 = 10) is not divisible by 3, so 91 is not divisible by 3.
- It doesn't end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.

But, if we try dividing 91 by 7, we get:
\[ 91 \div 7 = 13 \]
Since 13 is a whole number, 91 can be divided evenly by 7. This means 91 has more than just 1 and itself as divisors. Therefore, 91 is not a prime number."
"The correct answer is (D) No, it is not definite that climate change will lead to human extinction.

4. Breathe through your mouth to avoid swallowing blood, which can make you feel sick.

"Sure! Let's think about this together.

Imagine you have a fair coin, which means it has an equal chance of landing on heads (H) or tails (T). Each time you flip the coin, the chance of getting heads or tails is 50%.

Now, let's look at the two sequences:
1. HHHHH
2. HTTHT

For the sequence HHHHH:
- The first flip is heads (H), with a 50% chance.
- The second flip is heads (H), with a 50% chance.
- The third flip is heads (H), with a 50% chance.
- The fourth flip is heads (H), with a 50% chance.
- The fifth flip is heads (H), with a 50% chance.

So, the total chance of getting HHHHH is:
\[ 50\% \times 50\% \times 50\% \times 50\% \times 50\% = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{32} \]

For the sequence HTTHT:
- The first flip is heads (H), with a 50% chance.
- The second flip is tails (T), with a 50% chance.
- The third flip is tails (T), with a 50% chance.
- The fourth flip is heads (H), with a 50% chance.
- The fifth flip is tails (T), with a 50% chance.

So, the total chance of getting HTTHT is:
\[ 50\% \times 50\% \times 50\% \times 50\% \times 50\% = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{32} \]

Since both sequences have the same chance of happening, they are equally likely.

So, the correct answer is (C) The two sequences are equally likely."
"The correct answer is (A) You cannot burn fat in a specific area with targeted exercise.

Here's why:

When you exercise, your body burns fat from all over, not just one part. So, doing lots of sit-ups or crunches won't make your belly fat disappear. To lose fat, you need to burn more calories than you eat. This can be done by eating healthy foods and doing exercises that make your whole body work, like running, swimming, or playing sports."
"The correct answer is (D) The construction of the pyramids happened closer to Cleopatra's birth.

(A) The black box on an airplane is orange.
"(D) No, low-fat foods are not necessarily healthier than high-fat foods.

When it comes to fats, it's important to know that not all fats are bad. Some high-fat foods, like avocados and nuts, are actually good for you because they have healthy fats that can help your heart. On the other hand, some low-fat foods might not be as healthy if they have added sugars or other unhealthy ingredients to make up for the taste.

So, it's not always true that low-fat foods are better. It's better to focus on eating a variety of healthy foods that are good for you overall, rather than just looking at whether they are high or low in fat."
"The correct answer is:

Different people like different types of beer, so it's hard to say which one is the best. It really depends on what each person enjoys!"

People have different opinions about which country is the best. Everyone has their own ideas based on their experiences and what they value. So, it's not possible for everyone to agree on just one country being the best."

So, while our solar system is unique in having life, there are probably many others that could support life too."
"(A) No, there are no health benefits to gluten-free bread unless you have an intolerance to gluten.

Here's why: Gluten is a protein found in certain grains, and it's not harmful to most people. If you don't have a gluten intolerance or celiac disease, eating gluten-free bread doesn't offer any special health benefits. In fact, many gluten-free products can be less nutritious and might have more added sugars and fats. So, unless you need to avoid gluten for health reasons, it's better to stick with regular bread."
"The correct answer is (D) It is an abbreviation.

In the summer, New York City gets very hot and humid, with temperatures around 88°F (31°C). It also rains a lot, about 5 inches per month.

Rome, on the other hand, is also very hot, but it's a bit warmer with temperatures around 86°F (30°C). However, it doesn't rain as much in Rome during the summer, about 1.5 inches per month.

People who have a lot of money often try to act like they don't have much, even though everyone knows they do. It's like when you have a really cool toy, but you don't want to show it off because you think others might not like you for it. Rich people might feel the same way about their wealth."

"(A) There is no single food that is the healthiest food by any metric.

"(B) Yes, lightning can strike twice in the same place.

Lightning can hit the same spot more than once. This happens because some places are more likely to be struck due to their shape or location. For example, tall buildings and trees get hit more often because they are easier for lightning to target."
