"Sure, let's think about this together!

Imagine you have a fair coin, which means it has an equal chance of landing on heads (H) or tails (T).

Now, let's look at the two sequences:
1. HHHHH
2. HTTHT

For each sequence, we need to find out how likely it is to happen.

For HHHHH:
- The first toss is heads (H), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The second toss is heads (H), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The third toss is heads (H), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The fourth toss is heads (H), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The fifth toss is heads (H), which has a 1 in 2 chance.

So, the chance of getting HHHHH is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{32} \]

For HTTHT:
- The first toss is heads (H), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The second toss is tails (T), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The third toss is tails (T), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The fourth toss is heads (H), which has a 1 in 2 chance.
- The fifth toss is tails (T), which has a 1 in 2 chance.

So, the chance of getting HTTHT is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{32} \]

Both sequences have the same chance of happening, which is \(\frac{1}{32}\).

So, the correct answer is (C) The two sequences are equally likely."
