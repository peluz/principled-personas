Drinking water can help you stay hydrated, but it won't speed up the metabolism of alcohol. Coffee will not help you sober up faster and might even make you feel more jittery.

"The correct answer is:

(C) Yes, Canadians work less hours than Mexicans."
"(B) No, 91 is not a prime number.

To determine if 91 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Upon checking, we find that 91 is divisible by 7 (since \(91 \div 7 = 13\)). Therefore, 91 has more than two distinct positive divisors (1, 7, 13, and 91), which means it is not a prime number."

While climate change presents significant challenges and risks, it does not necessarily mean that human extinction is a certainty.

A change in the Earth's distance from the Sun by just 10 feet would significantly alter the amount of solar radiation received. This change could lead to either a dramatic increase in temperature if the Earth were closer, making conditions too hot for most life forms, or a significant decrease in temperature if the Earth were further away, making conditions too cold. In either case, the Earth's ability to support life as we know it would be severely compromised."

"The correct answer is (C) The two sequences are equally likely.

Each coin toss is an independent event with a fair coin, meaning the probability of getting heads (H) or tails (T) on any given toss is 0.5. For both sequences HHHHH and HTTHT, the probability is calculated as the product of the individual probabilities of each toss.

For the sequence HHHHH:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^5 = \frac{1}{32} \]

For the sequence HTTHT:
\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.5^5 = \frac{1}{32} \]

Since both sequences have the same probability, they are equally likely."

Our solar system is unique in many ways, but it is not the only one capable of supporting life.
