"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. So, the total number of eggs used each day is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. The remaining eggs that she can sell are 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is 9 * $2 = $18.

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."
"A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber. Since half of 2 is 1, the robe needs 1 bolt of white fiber.

In total, the robe needs:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To find out how much profit Josh made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The house's value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens.
2. Determine the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing pattern. The first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

For each pair:
- First glass: $5
- Second glass: $3

So, the cost for each pair of glasses is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can find the number of pairs by dividing 16 by 2:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:**
$64"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Sheep in Seattle:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Number of Sheep in Charleston:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - So, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).

3. **Number of Sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - So, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

4. **Total Number of Sheep:**
   - To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.
   - Total number of sheep = \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"Eliza works 40 hours at a regular rate of $10 per hour and 5 hours of overtime at 1.2 times her regular rate.

First, calculate her regular earnings:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 \]

Next, calculate her overtime rate:
\[ 1.2 \times \$10 = \$12/\text{hour} \]

Then, calculate her overtime earnings:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 \]

Finally, add her regular and overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
\[ \$400 + \$60 = \$460 \]

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\$460\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then add them together.

1. **Donuts:**
   - 3 dozen at $68 per dozen: \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - 2 dozen at $80 per dozen: \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - 6 dozen at $55 per dozen: \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[204 + 160 + 330 = 694\]

So, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
5. Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
6. Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
7. Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
8. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:
   \[
   20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Next, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find out how many are left:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students}
   \]

3. Then, we need to find out how many of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance, we calculate:
   \[
   25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]

4. Now, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:
   \[
   16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]

5. Finally, to find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:
   \[
   \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\%
   \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:
\[
\boxed{60\%}
\]"

"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days.

To find the total distance covered by each train, we add the distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. She works 50 weeks a year.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- So, her weekly earnings from teaching are \(35 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700\).
- Over 50 weeks, her annual earnings from teaching are \(50 \text{ weeks} \times \$700/\text{week} = \$35,000\).

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- So, her weekly earnings from coaching are \(15 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450\).
- Over 50 weeks, her annual earnings from coaching are \(50 \text{ weeks} \times \$450/\text{week} = \$22,500\).

Finally, to find her total annual salary, we add her earnings from both jobs:
- Total annual salary = \$35,000 (from teaching) + \$22,500 (from coaching) = \$57,500.

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is \(\$57,500\)."

   \]

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to hike 12 miles at an average speed of 4 miles per hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the remaining time to hike the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to hike:**

"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

"Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, let's determine Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond is 6 years younger, Raymond is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we know that Raymond had his son at the age of 23. Therefore, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]

This means Raymond's son is currently:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract his current age from Samantha's current age:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

Therefore, Raymond's son was born \(\boxed{2}\) years ago."

\]
So, Mishka spent $49.50 on shorts.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
\[
3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]
So, Mishka spent $67.50 on pants.

Then, let's calculate the total cost for the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
\[
3 \times 42 = 126
\]
So, Mishka spent $126 on shoes.

Now, we sum the amounts spent on each type of item to find the total amount spent:

"Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
   \[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

2. Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end, we subtract 15 miles from the 40 miles:
   \[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\) miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that one pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.
4. The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. So, if the cost of the boots is \(B\), then we can write the equation:
   \[
   B - 5 = 99
   \]
5. To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \(B\):
   \[
   B = 99 + 5 = 104
   \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age now is 162, we can set up the following equations to find their current ages.

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). The sum of their ages is given by:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so adding 20 gives 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so adding 20 to 80 gives 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. We are also told that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's use variables to represent the number of silver and gold coins:
- Let \( S \) be the number of silver coins.
- Let \( G \) be the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of coins is 110, so \( S + G = 110 \).
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so \( G = S + 30 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins is 40, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Given the information, let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, first, we find half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Aaron has 5 more than this amount:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts he gets in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each. So, the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, which costs:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total money he had initially minus the cost of the video games and the leftover money is:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set was sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = 1.5v \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   \[
   6v = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour. Since her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, her running speed is:
\[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Her running speed is four times her walking speed, so her walking speed is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

In six hours, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Therefore, the time spent running is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
And the time spent walking is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

The distance she covers while running is:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
And the distance she covers while walking is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances together, the total distance she can travel in six hours is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the calorie content per gram of the bag of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since 1 gram of chips contains 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"To find Charlie's net profit, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**

   - To make 20 candles, he needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics. She writes an average of 4 hours per article. Let's break down the number of articles she wrote each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.

"Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. After buying a package, she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. We need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she bought.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

Initially, she had 80 Post-it notes. After buying the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, calculate the number of blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, calculate the number of red ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Determine the cost of each red tie:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

"Lloyd has an egg farm where his chickens produce 252 eggs per day. He sells these eggs for $2 per dozen. To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.
3. Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12:
\[ \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozen} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs.**

Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen. Therefore, his daily earnings are:
\[ 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs.**

There are 7 days in a week, so his weekly earnings are:

"Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $140 per month. For the first half of the year, she pays the full amount each month. There are 6 months in the first half, so the total for the first half is:
\[ 6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half of the year, the charge is reduced by 10%. The reduced monthly charge is:
\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]
There are also 6 months in the second half, so the total for the second half is:
\[ 6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts for both halves of the year gives the total amount paid by the end of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To find out how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency first. We know that she has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. So, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank by multiplying her car's fuel efficiency by the total gallons in the tank:

\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Luke is building a 4-level sandcastle where each level has half the square footage of the level below it. The top level (Level 1) has a square footage of 16 square feet.

1. **Level 1 (Top Level):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 2:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **Level 3:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **Level 4:** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Now, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is:

"Cecilia is feeding her new puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then, she will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. We need to find out how many bags of dog food, each containing 110 cups, Cecilia will use in the first year.

First, let's calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are required for these 180 cups. Since each bag contains 110 cups:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

Since Cecilia cannot buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find out how much laundry David does by dividing Sarah's amount by 4:
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we can find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's amount by 2:
\[ R = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying them in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus packages of 2 for $1.00 each.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the football team played a total of 22 games. We are also told that the team won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use variables to represent the number of games won and lost:
- Let \( W \) be the number of games won.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22, so \( W + L = 22 \).
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, so \( W = L + 8 \).

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

So, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies of his record.
2. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so she sold \( 10H \) copies.
3. The total number of copies sold by both of them combined is 88,000. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   H + 10H = 88,000
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   11H = 88,000
   \]
5. To find \( H \), divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000

"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate the amount for both the adult and child dinosaurs and then add them together.

1. **Adult Dinosaurs:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adult dinosaurs.
   - Total for adults: \( 20 \times 10 = 200 \) lbs.

2. **Child Dinosaurs:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 5 child dinosaurs.
   - Total for children: \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) lbs.

3. **Total Potato Salad Needed:**
   - Total for adults: 200 lbs.
   - Total for children: 25 lbs.
   - Combined total: \( 200 + 25 = 225 \) lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring \(\boxed{225}\) pounds of potato salad to the picnic."

2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, we add up the pets:
\[ \text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

So, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."

   \]
3. Gerald improved his speed by 10%. This means he can now run 90% of his original time. So, we calculate 90% of 40 seconds:
   \[
   40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of dogs and cats:**
   - The number of dogs is given as 60.
   - The number of cats is two times the number of dogs, so the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:**
   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits, which is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"First, let's determine the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class. The total number of students is 200, and \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them are boys. So, the number of boys is:

Since the rest of the students are girls, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Harry slept for 9 hours. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, which is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\) hours. Therefore, Harry slept \(9 - 6 = 3\) more hours than James.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through, and we don't know how many yet. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drive through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the information given:

- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

First, we need to determine how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[
\frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/segment}} = 14 \text{ segments}
\]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover one 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover one segment:
\[
14 \text{ segments} \times 10 \text{ minutes/segment} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"First, let's determine the inner dimensions of one box. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick. This means we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner dimensions (1 inch from each side of a dimension).

So, the inner dimensions of one box are:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total hours of TV watched:

\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
7. Then, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon:
   \[
   10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00
   \]

2. Next, calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon:
   \[
   10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00
   \]

3. Finally, subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost:
   \[
   \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00
   \]

So, the final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is:
\[
\$28.00

"To find the average number of fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate.
2. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate.
3. Add the totals from both to get the combined total.
4. Divide the combined total by 2 to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total for Beatrice:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total for Marcell:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total distance to the shore:**
   - Julia takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - The rate of rowing is \( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \).
   - Total distance to the shore: \( \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \).

2. **Calculate the rate of water intake:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Rate of water intake: \( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - Total water taken on: \( 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \).

Therefore, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \( \boxed{16} \) liters."

"Given the problem, we need to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if Brittany's phone can hold \( B \) photographs, then:
   \[
   1800 = 6B
   \]
   Solving for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

3. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( D \) be the number of ducks. Then:
   \[
   B = 50D
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
   \[
   300 = 50D
   \]
   Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{300}{50} = 6

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is $90."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by 7x. Substituting the value of x, we get:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[42\]"

"On the first day, there were 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles, so the total number of vehicles was \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - If Lylah's salary four years ago was \( L \), then \( 40,000 = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current salary is \( 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is \( 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's current salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that there are 700 bees in total in a hive. We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's define the number of queens as \( Q \).

Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, the number of baby bees \( B \) is:
\[ B = 2Q \]

And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees \( W \) is:
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

The total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

Now that we know the number of queens \( Q = 100 \), we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

First, we identify the non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps. The total cost of these non-food items is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

There is a 10% tax on the non-food items, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items (milk and eggs) is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so he will have a total of 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for each client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

For 8 clients, the total cost will be:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9 \text{ per client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. The profit is the difference between total income and total expenses:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. He can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that can be harvested in one go:
   \[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

2. Determine how many times John can harvest in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year and he harvests every 3 months:
   \[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
   \[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

Adding these together, the total number of pieces is:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of those 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return. The total number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees.

So, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Charlie has 12 friends.
2. Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \(D\). According to the problem, Charlie's friends can be expressed as \(3D\).
3. Since Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3D = 12
   \]
4. Solving for \(D\), we divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.
5. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is:
   \[
   4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:
\[
16

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:

"Shawnda is providing a bike inflation service. Here's the breakdown of the charges:

- For bicycles: Each bicycle has 2 tires. On the first day, 5 people came to get both tires inflated, so that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Three people came to get all their tricycle tires inflated, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: Each unicycle has 1 tire. One person came to get their unicycle tire inflated, so that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these up, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\).

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is \(20 \times 25 = 500\) cents. Converting cents to dollars, we get \(500 \div 100 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."
"Carl buys ten packs of cookies, with each pack containing six cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10. First, we calculate the total number of cookies:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

We need to find the total number of fries initially in the pack.

Starting from the end:
- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. So, before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's say there were \( y \) fries. The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes each week.

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:

"First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

- Rolls: \(300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}\)
- Chocolate croissants: \(120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}\)
- Baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\) (since each baguette is 2 feet long, and \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches)

Now, we add up the total length in inches:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys' requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

First, let's calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, we calculate the number of fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Adding the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \$20
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Convert the percentage increase to a decimal:**
   \[
   20\% = 0.20
   \]

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

4. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

5. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

7. **Multiply the original price by the result:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:

First, we need to find out the total minimum monthly payment Jessica has to make for all her debts:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Adding these up, we get:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amount given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Amount given to daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
3. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to find the total:

\[
40 + 36 + 46 = 122
\]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is \(\boxed{122}\)."
"Lloyd earns $10 per hour for tutoring. 

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks, we get:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \(\$130\) for the first two weeks."

"To find out how many red roses Fred needs to deliver, we start by figuring out the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]
Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]
Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we need to find out how old Jean is.

First, let's determine Mark's age two years ago. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was \(30 - 2 = 28\).

Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).

So, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old.

Since this was two years ago, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

We are also given that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:
\[ 220 \text{ seconds} - 212 \text{ seconds} = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"
"Jenna's mother picked 20 apples. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, Jenna picked \(20 \div 2 = 10\) apples. Together, they picked \(20 + 10 = 30\) apples.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Total Straw:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.

4. **Rats:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = \(\frac{90}{6} = 15\).

5. **Rats in Cages:**
   - The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
   - Number of rats per cage = \(\frac{15}{3} = 5\).

The number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."

**Month 1:**
- Initial amount: $100
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
- Total amount after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- New principal: $102
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- New principal: $104.04
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is \(\boxed{106.12}\)."
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of buying each bag is $20, so for \( x \) bags, the cost is \( 20x \) dollars.
   - The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so for \( x \) bags, the cost is \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The revenue from selling each bag is $30, so for \( x \) bags, the revenue is \( 30x \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.
   - So, we have the equation: \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   \[
   8x = 400

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"First, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of Tickets:**
   - The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.

2. **Cost of Food:**
   - They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
   - So, the cost of food is \(20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75\).

3. **Cost of Rides:**
   - Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the rides is \(33 \times 2 = 66\).

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding up all the costs, we get:
     \[
     20.25 \, (\text{tickets}) + 15.75 \, (\text{food}) + 66 \, (\text{rides}) = 102
     \]

5. **Cost per Person:**
   - Since there are 3 friends, each person pays:

"To find out how many pounds of insects ten ducks need per day, we can break it down into a few simple steps:

1. Calculate the total weekly need for the flock.
2. Convert the weekly need into a daily need.

Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, the total weekly need is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly total by 7 to find the daily need:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}

   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, we calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting is:
\[10 + 20 = 30\] dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[70 - 30 = 40\] dollars.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40, we set up the equation:
\[4x = 40\]
\[x = \frac{40}{4} = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens \( w \) can be expressed as \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be written as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers. The total number of customers by the third day was 500. Therefore, the number of customers she counted on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool in gallons.
   - Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool in gallons.

2. **Understand the Rate of Water Loss:**
   - Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

3. **Determine the Amount of Water 4 Minutes Ago:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

4. **Set Up the First Equation:**
   - According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
   - Therefore, \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \).

5. **Set Up the Second Equation:**
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.
   - Therefore, \( B = 4S \).

6. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( S \):
     \[
     4S + 16 = 2S + 32
     \]
     \[
     4S - 2S = 32 - 16
     \]
     \[
     2S = 16
     \]
     \[
     S = 8
     \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( \boxed{8} \) gallons."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack as follows:

1. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old
- Zack: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old
- Adrian: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old

To find the average age of the three in three years, we calculate:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's points are:

"James starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 more grass type cards, the new counts are:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 \approx 33.33 \]

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer gives us:

"Mike was a pen pal with 5 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them. They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Let's break it down:

1. **Number of pen pals left**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Letters sent and received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters.

3. **Letters Mike sends**: Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

4. **Total pages written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.

5. **Time spent writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.

6. **Convert minutes to hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem states that this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is:

1. **Daily Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours each day.
   - Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

2. **Weekly Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   - Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

3. **Total Cost for 5 Weeks:**
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - Total cost before discount = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

4. **Applying the 10% Discount:**
   - The makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
   - Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Therefore, Jean paid \(\boxed{27000}\)."

"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, with each bag weighing 50 pounds. The total weight of onions is \(4 \times 50 = 200\) pounds. Since the cost of one pound of onions is $1.50, the total cost is \(200 \times 1.50 = 300\) dollars.

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate:
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, the total calories consumed by each of them are:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, let's figure out how many cougars Rick killed today:
- Cougars killed today = 15 - 3 = 12

Next, we calculate the number of wolves killed today:
- Wolves killed today = 3 × 12 = 36

Now, we add up all the animals killed:
- Wolves killed in total = 10 (yesterday) + 36 (today) = 46
- Cougars killed in total = 15 (yesterday) + 12 (today) = 27

Total animals killed = 46 (wolves) + 27 (cougars) = 73

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He rides the elevator to a floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6. So, we calculate the target floor as:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cows:**
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - So, the total number of cows initially is \(10 \times 20 = 200\).

2. **Adding New Cows:**
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls.
   - Therefore, each stall gets \( \frac{40}{20} = 2 \) new cows.

3. **Total Cows per Stall:**
   - After adding the new cows, each stall now has \(20 + 2 = 22\) cows.

4. **Cows in 8 Stalls:**
   - We need to find the total number of cows in 8 of these stalls.
   - So, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is \(8 \times 22 = 176\).

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is \(\boxed{176}\)."
"To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has and then sum these values.

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 1 penny is equal to $0.01, the total value of the pennies is:
   \[
   100 \times 0.01 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Nickels**: Brady has 40 nickels. Since 1 nickel is equal to $0.05, the total value of the nickels is:
   \[
   40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}

"The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. First, we find the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood remains. To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay transfer fees of 3% of the selling price and a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price. Additionally, he paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount on the house. To find out his net proceeds, we need to calculate the total deductions and subtract them from the selling price.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000

"To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the problem into steps:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.

1. **Lyrics to the Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.

"Currently, Mico and Marco's ages sum up to 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, the total additional age for both of them combined will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years. Adding this to their current total age, we get \(20 + 20 = 30\).

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba:**
   - A cobra has 70 spots.
   - A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   - Therefore, a mamba has \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.
   - So, the total number of spots for the cobras is \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \) spots.

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each mamba has 35 spots.
   - So, the total number of spots for the mambas is \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \) spots.

4. **Find the combined total number of spots for all cobras and mambas:**
   - The combined total is \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \) spots.

5. **Find half of the combined total number of spots:**
   - Half of 4900 is \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people at the soccer game:

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.
- Including the 3 coaches, the total number of people is \(12 + 24 + 3 = 39\).

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required. Since each pizza serves 3 people, we divide the total number of people by 3:

\[ \frac{39}{3} = 13 \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195."
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones, we get the length occupied by the sterling silver beads:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:
\[ 17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. In the second week, each doubled their first week's output:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) more stories.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) more stories.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) more stories.

Adding the first and second week's stories for each:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

The total number of stories written by all three is:

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. First, let's calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes in cents.

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these values together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, we first need to calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of stars in the 2 rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

3. Add the stars from the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   24 + 12 = 36
   \]

4. Subtract the 36 stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   \[
   76 - 36 = 40
   \]

5. Divide the number of 5-star stars by 5 to find the number of 5-star rows:

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles. To find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we use the formula for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values for the slow lane car:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

"First, let's calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we need to distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

"Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a 30-minute break. First, calculate the total working time in minutes:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals} \]

Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are:

"After the first three rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points:
- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Adding these together, the total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
83"
"Will buys 15 oranges. His oldest son, who is 8 years old, will wash 8 oranges, and his youngest son, who is half the age of the oldest son (4 years old), will wash 4 oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges washed is:
8 (by the oldest son) + 4 (by the youngest son) = 12 oranges.

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is:
15 (total oranges) - 12 (washed oranges) = 3 oranges.

The final answer is 3 unwashed oranges."
"On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses. On the second day, he does 20 more pushups than the first day, 10 fewer squats, and doubles the number of dumbbell presses.

Let's calculate the number of each activity on the second day:
- Pushups: \(100 + 20 = 120\)
- Squats: \(50 - 10 = 40\)
- Dumbbell presses: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)

Now, let's find the total number of each activity over the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these together gives the total count of activities:

So, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 members who eat rice at both lunch and dinner. 

First, calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household:
\[ 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, calculate the weekly consumption:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Given that the household has a 42 kg bag of rice, the number of weeks it will last is:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell the bread. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. 

First, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates

Total crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and the weekend:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."

"John hires a driving service to get him to work each day. His work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day. He works 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year. He gets charged $2 per mile driven and also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.

First, let's calculate the total miles driven in a year:
- Miles per day: 30 miles to work + 30 miles back = 60 miles
- Miles per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
- Miles per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15000 miles/year

Next, we calculate the cost for the miles driven:
- Cost per mile: $2
- Total cost for miles: 15000 miles * $2/mile = $30000

Now, let's calculate the annual bonus:
- Bonus per month: $150
- Total annual bonus: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800

Finally, we add the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus to get the total annual cost:
- Total annual cost: $30000 + $1800 = $31800

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
\[

"Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells for $20. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. We need to find out how much money she earned in the second year.

First, let's determine how many books she sold in the first year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2 \times \text{Books sold this year} = 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of books sold over the three years. Since there are currently 50 unsold books, the total number of books sold is:
\[ \text{Total books sold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Now, we can find out how many books were sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = \text{Total books sold} - \text{Books sold in the first year} - \text{Books sold this year} \]
\[ \text{Books sold in the second year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = \text{Books sold in the second year} \times \text{Price per book} \]
\[ \text{Money earned in the second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week, so he works 50 hours a week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the total number of players on the football team is 105. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

"Martha invited a total of 24 people to her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. That means she invited \(2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\) people in total.

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and \(\frac{1}{4}\) of those 8 people had previous commitments. So, \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people had previous commitments.

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people actually showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna and added them to a store that already had 50 marbles. His father then gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. 

First, calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
\]

Next, add the marbles together:
\[
20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles}
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[
78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kgs/marble} = 156 \text{ kgs}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[
\boxed{156}

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**
   The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Cost to Fill the Pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can determine the number of girls and nongendered children based on the provided information.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can find the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. The ratio tells us that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.
2. If there are 45 electric wires, we can set up the proportion: \(\frac{\text{number of poles}}{\text{number of wires}} = \frac{1}{3}\).
3. Let the number of poles be \(P\). Then, \(\frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3}\).
4. Solving for \(P\), we multiply both sides by 45: \(P = \frac{45}{3} = 15\).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"The book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The cost of the pen is $1."
"Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils. We can find the number of pencils in each box by subtracting the loose pencils from the total and then dividing by the number of boxes:

\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]
\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. Adding these together gives the total number of pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cubes are added to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every new record someone gets, they need to trade 2 old records.

If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we need to find out how many old records they traded in total.

Since each new record requires 2 old records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   - So, the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\).

2. **Calculate the total payment to junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment to junior programmers is \(40 \times 2000 = 80000\).

3. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is \(100 - 40 = 60\).

4. **Calculate the payment to senior programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid \(2000 + 400 = 2400\) per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment to senior programmers is \(60 \times 2400 = 144000\).

5. **Calculate the total payment to all programmers:**
   - The total payment is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers.
   - So, the total payment is \(80000 + 144000 = 224000\).

The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the Rewards Earned:**
   - The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - So, the number of $20 increments in $80 is \( \frac{80}{20} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, the customer earned $4 in rewards.

2. **Apply the Rewards and Coupon:**
   - On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43.
   - They used the $4 reward, so the remaining amount after using the reward is \( 43 - 4 = 39 \) dollars.
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of the reward off the price, which is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.
   - So, the total amount deducted is \( 4 + 8 = 12 \) dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

For Job A:
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's compare the net pay:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We have a class of 200 students split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."

"John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

He also watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let's denote the total time spent on vacation by \( T \). Then we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Annabelle already has $80 in her savings.
2. From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
3. From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
4. Adding her initial savings and the earnings from both jobs, she has \(80 + 200 + 75 = 355\) dollars.
5. The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is \(400 - 355 = 45\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount Annabelle still needs to save is \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:

\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:

\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree, so its height is:

\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is \(\boxed{34}\) feet."
"Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each and 5 teddy bears at $1 each. First, let's calculate the total cost of the items he bought:

- Cost of teddy bears: \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:
\[12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars}\]

Dean started with $28. After spending $17, the amount of money he has left is:
\[28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars}\]

His mother then gives him an extra $10, so the total amount of money Dean has now is:
\[11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person to play one round of mini-golf, ride the go-karts twice, and have $5 in arcade tokens. Then, we'll subtract this from her budget to see how much is left for her friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

\[
\boxed{2}

   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the amount of money spent on candy:**
   - Billy initially had $10.
   - He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
   - Amount spent on candy = \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy bought:**
   - The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound.
   - Amount spent on candy = $6.
   - Number of pounds of candy = \( \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \) pounds.

So, the number of pounds of candy Billy bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Carver is 45 years old and that this age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can set up the equation based on this information.

Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \).

The equation based on the problem statement is:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
2. It then travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
3. The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is:
   \[
   75 + 100 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total distance for one complete trip:
\[
75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[
300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}
\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[
\frac{18000}{900} = 20
\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of stuffing required for different types of dog beds and then calculate the total amount needed for the specified number of beds.

1. **Rottweiler Bed**: Requires 8 pounds of stuffing.
2. **Chihuahua Bed**: Requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
3. **Collie Bed**: Requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler and a chihuahua bed. The average is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is \(\boxed{23}\) pounds."

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares. According to the problem, \(\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8\).

To find \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is \(\boxed{32}\) hectares."

\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages delivered is 88."
"Let's break down the costs for both David and Dasha.

For Dasha:
- Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket is $2.
- So, the cost per ride is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.
- Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

For David:
- David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which gives him 9 rides.
- So, the total cost for David is $30.

Now, let's find out how much money David saves:
- The cost for Dasha is $36.
- The cost for David is $30.
- The difference in cost is \(36 - 30 = 6\) dollars.

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{6}\) dollars."
"Monica is wrapping a total of 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together, we get:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for each of these 12 gifts. To find out how much ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we determine the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Tim decides to cancel his $60 cable subscription and switch to streaming services. Netflix costs $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a bundle discount, he saves 20%.

First, calculate the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the discount:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, apply the 20% discount to the combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Now, add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Finally, subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the original cable cost to find the savings:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, Tim saves:
\[ \boxed{34} \text{ dollars per month} \]"
"Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. First, let's convert all the times to the same unit, which is hours.

- Writing a song: 4 hours
- Recording: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
- Editing: 90 minutes is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

Now, let's add up the total time spent:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system.

First, calculate the total number of slots available in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of slots is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, we need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place. According to the problem, she wants to place 20 more than double the number of slots. So, we calculate double the number of slots and then add 20:
\[ 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. So, the total number of pre-made cards is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding the cards Erica made and the pre-made cards, she had a total of \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards.

Next, she passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family. So, the total number of cards she gave away is \(24 + 5 = 29\).

She also received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica now has, we subtract the cards she gave away from her total and then add the cards she received:

\[50 - 29 + 17 = 38\]

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"Jenny starts with a pizza that has 12 slices. She gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill and \( \frac{1}{4} \) to Mark. First, we calculate the number of slices given to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]
Next, we calculate the number of slices given to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]
Adding the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]
Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats and the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]
Therefore, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save: $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount in the bank) = $250.
2. Determine how many days it will take for Mark to save $250 if he earns $10 per day: $250 / $10 per day = 25 days.

Therefore, Mark needs to save for \(\boxed{25}\) days."
"Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes she saw is 1/3 of the number of spiders, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \]

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs is:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[ 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"Given that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

To find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:
\[ \text{Difference} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

   - So, the total earnings in a year are \(288 \times 50 = 14400\) dollars.

Therefore, the builder earns \(\boxed{14400}\) dollars in a year."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, we need to multiply the normal recipe quantities by 4.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups
- Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups
- Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy:
- Bags of flour: 6
- Bottles of milk: 2
- Difference: \(6 - 2 = 4\)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much energy the air conditioner uses per day when it runs for 8 hours. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert 7200 watts to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, if Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will use the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, we find the daily savings in energy consumption:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes.

Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

Adding these together gives:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[\text{Average} = \frac{88}{4} = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To find out how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \(\frac{20}{4} = 5\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \(5 \times 1 = 5\) pounds.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \(5 \times 1 = 5\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \(5 \times 7 = 35\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost of meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \(35 + 15 = 50\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Corns:**
   - We know Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis.
   - He has 40 cannolis.
   - Therefore, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **New Number of Cannolis:**
   - Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   - The new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Number of Corns:**
   - Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.
   - He bought 60 cannolis, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
   - The new total number of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.
   - The new total number of corns is 60.
   - The combined total is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, we calculate the total steps he had already taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Since he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps, the total steps he had taken before his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps} \]

Therefore, the steps he took during his jog are:
\[ 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. The book averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, so the time it takes him to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After finishing the book, it takes him 10 more minutes to get to the airport, so the total time from the start of reading until he leaves for the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, the number of minutes early he will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for one employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15

"Sally went to the seashore and her parents gave her $10 to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- The seashells cost $1.50.
- Each magnet costs $0.25, so 4 magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- The total cost is $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
- $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:

"Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400 and another pack worth twice that amount, which is $800. The total cost before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200. He gets a 20% discount on the $1200, so the discount amount is $1200 \times 0.20 = $240. The cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. He also buys a finale firework for $150. Therefore, the total amount he spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles both smell like wet dog and will explode. We know that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog and 1% of the candles will explode. Assuming these two defects are independent, we can calculate the number of candles that have both defects.

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 0.01 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.
3. Each camel has 2 humps.
4. Each dromedary has 1 hump.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve these equations. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):

\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):

\[
124 + d = 180
\]

Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for 4 days: \(200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}\).

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   - Distance for 2 days: \(800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}\).

3. **Next Day:**
   - He didn't travel at all, so the distance is \(0 \text{ km}\).

4. **Second Week:**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week: \(300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}\).

5. **Total Distance:**
   - Sum up all the distances: \(800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}\).

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{3140}\) kilometers."
"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying 5 by 4:
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying 20 by 2:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his initial elevation of 10,000 feet, landing on a ledge at 6,000 feet. Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver must climb the difference in elevation, which is 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and each boat carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

"Sure, let's break down the cost step by step.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \times 8 = 48
   \]
   So, the cost for the first 6 months is $48.

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \times 12 = 96
   \]
   So, the cost for the next 8 months is $96.

3. **The remaining 8 months at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \times 14 = 112
   \]
   So, the cost for the last 8 months is $112.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the tattered jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is \( 28 - 6 = 22 \).

3. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

4. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \).
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \).

5. **Find the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22.
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is $2.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \).

6. **Calculate the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference is \( 28 - 24 = 4 \).

"Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash, so he has a total of $150 from selling his cards. Each card is sold for $1.5, so the number of cards he sold is $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards. Since he keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3, and the 2/3 of his cards equals 100, we can set up the equation \(\frac{2}{3}x = 100\). Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150\).

Therefore, the number of cards Kenny started with is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs and the other half getting one. This means 18 guests were supposed to get 2 hotdogs each, totaling 36 hotdogs, and the other 18 guests were supposed to get 1 hotdog each, totaling 18 hotdogs. Therefore, the caterer prepared a total of 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. The 18 guests who were supposed to get two hotdogs each already got their two hotdogs, so they consumed 36 hotdogs. The remaining 22 guests each wanted one more hotdog, so they needed 22 more hotdogs. This means a total of 58 hotdogs were needed, but only 54 were prepared.

The number of hotdogs short is \(58 - 54 = 4\). Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:

"First, we need to find out how much gasoline is in each container. Since 15 gallons of gas were divided equally into 5 containers, we divide 15 by 5:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to determine how much gasoline Josey needed. She needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of $5.

"Antoine's French onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He doubles the recipe, so he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and beef stock gives:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads.
- Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack of red} + 2 \text{ packs of clear} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Next, we need to determine the time James took for each part of the triathlon:
- Swim: James finishes 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
  \[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- Bike ride: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
  \[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

"First, let's figure out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH). Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance covered is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to calculate how much hay the horse eats. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for the super ticket option: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of the regular ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's say the regular price of popcorn is \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the super ticket option.
   - We can set up the equation: $21 - ($15 + \( P \)) = $2

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   21 - 15 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   6 - P = 2

\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"First, let's find the number of green cards. We know there are 15 red cards, and there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find the number of yellow cards. The problem states that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Finally, we add up all the cards to get the total number of cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

After twenty minutes, another 25 fairies joined from the east (half of 50). So, the total number of fairies became:
\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, the remaining number of fairies is:
\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

The final number of fairies remaining is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to determine the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Now, we sum up the total weight of all the feed:
\[3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490 \text{ pounds}\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number:
\[
\frac{4490}{2250} \approx 2.0044
\]
Rounding up, we get 3 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{3}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. We need to find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat to get a total of 5 cookies.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

The number of cookies Matt can have is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 6 inches is equal to:
   \[
   \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Benny saw 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

3. The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find out what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length, we use the formula for percentage:

"To find out how many kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything, we need to first determine how many kids are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts).

Given:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we can find the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both):
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

"Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall. In the human pyramid, the shortest cheerleader is at the top. Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:

\[ \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute walk every hour. So, each day she walks:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

After 5 days, the total time she has walked is:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Brett is currently 14 years old.
2. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.
3. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett is currently 14, three times his current age is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).
4. If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we can find her current age by subtracting 4 from 42. So, Angela's current age is \(42 - 4 = 38\).

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela's current age is 38.**"
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. To find out how much he spent in total, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride is $6.
- He drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride is $2.
- He drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- So, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{112}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the number of oranges Ashley brought. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Next, we need to find out how many oranges Brianne brought. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's find the total number of oranges they brought together:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can calculate the number of pies they can make by dividing the total number of oranges by 3:
\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \(200 + 5x\)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \(25x\)

We need to find the value of \(x\) for which the total costs are equal:
\[200 + 5x = 25x\]

First, subtract \(5x\) from both sides:
\[200 = 20x\]

Next, divide both sides by 20:
\[x = \frac{200}{20} = 10\]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.
4. The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.

We can write the equation for the total number of insects as:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Mariah and her grandma were knitting and used yarn from a skein that contains 364 yards. Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the skein, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the skein. To find out how much yarn they used altogether, we need to calculate the amount each used and then add those amounts.

First, calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, calculate the amount of yarn her grandma used:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, add the two amounts together to find the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[
\boxed{273}

"Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. She has 2 friends who each want 5 gifts, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) gifts. She also has 3 friends who each want 2 gifts, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) gifts. Additionally, she decides to buy 10 more random gifts. Adding these together, we get:
\[10 + 6 + 10 = 26\]

So, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is:
\[26\]"
"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $1.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. We need to find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation is:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"Frederick is making popsicle sticks from pieces of wood. A 2 x 4 piece of wood gives him 200 sticks and costs $4, while a 2 x 8 piece gives him 400 sticks and costs $6. He has $24 to spend on wood.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will give:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Next, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will give:
\[ 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Comparing the two options, the 2 x 8 pieces give more sticks. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ \boxed{1600} \]"
"To find out how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

First, since each dog has 4 legs and Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Next, since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Finally, if each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the snowshoes is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The weekly bus pass costs $20. Therefore, the savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be:
\[ 22 - 20 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.

First, let's find out how many cows the zoo has:
- Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

Next, let's find out how many sheep the farm has:
- Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

**Final Answer:**

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

First, let's find out how many onions Sophia bought:
- Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} \times 4 = 12
  \]
- Solving for the number of onions Sophia bought:
  \[
  \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
  \]

Next, let's find out how many potatoes Sophia bought:
- Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} \times 4 = 4
  \]
- Solving for the number of potatoes Sophia bought:
  \[
  \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:
- Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:
  \[
  3 \text{ onions} + 1 \text{ potato} = 4 \text{ items}

"To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to lose 30 lbs by his birthday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs:**
   - Since 1 lb requires burning 3500 calories, for 30 lbs, Andy needs to burn:
     \[
     30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of days Andy has to achieve this:**
   - Andy's goal is to lose the weight by July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.
   - From December 31st to July 19th:
     - December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days.
     - January has 31 days.
     - February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
     - March has 31 days.
     - April has 30 days.
     - May has 31 days.
     - June has 30 days.
     - July 1st to July 19th is 19 days.
   - Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 190 days.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit required:**
   - To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
     \[
     \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
     \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

We can substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot is $30,000, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags. Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for the bags is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) dollars.

She then sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue from selling the bags is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[320 - 32 = 288\]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned on her bags is \(\boxed{288}\)."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption:
- Daily consumption: 12 kWh per hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
- Weekly consumption: 288 kWh/day * 7 days = 2016 kWh

Next, calculate the cost of her current weekly electric bill:
- Cost: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024

Now, calculate her new weekly electric consumption after adding the new device:
- Additional daily consumption from the new device: 2 kWh per hour * 24 hours = 48 kWh
- New daily consumption: 288 kWh + 48 kWh = 336 kWh
- New weekly consumption: 336 kWh/day * 7 days = 2352 kWh

Calculate the cost of her new weekly electric bill:
- New cost: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

Finally, find the difference between her new and old weekly electric bills:

"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Ophelia and Jenna live in the same apartment building. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which means Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add Ophelia's and Jenna's sofas and chairs together:
- Total sofas: \(20 + 64 = 84\)
- Total chairs: \(22 + 66 = 88\)

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, and in total, he paid $48. To find the cost of the headphone set, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many additional CDs he could have bought by dividing the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:

\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Therefore, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's determine how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Calculate Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. **Find Jame's Cousin's Current Age:**
   - Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Calculate the Age Difference:**
   - The age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100. 

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

Finally, to find the cost of one monitor, divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we add up the vlogs she has already made:

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Now, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma needs to make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to meet her goal."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The original bill is $50.
2. The tip is 20% of $50, which is calculated as:
   \[
   0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]
3. Adding the tip to the original bill gives:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60
   \]
4. Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

So, you end up paying $30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:

"Elvis has a monthly savings target of $1125. In April, he plans to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month compared to the first half to meet his target.

1. April has 30 days, so the first half has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.
2. Let's say Elvis saves $x$ dollars each day in the first half.
3. In the second half, he saves $2x$ dollars each day.
4. The total savings for the first half is $15x$.
5. The total savings for the second half is $15 \times 2x = 30x$.
6. The total monthly savings is $15x + 30x = 45x$.
7. We know his target is $1125, so we set up the equation: $45x = 1125$.
8. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25$.
9. Therefore, in the second half, Elvis saves $2x = 2 \times 25 = 50$ dollars each day.

So, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit:

- The cost of the oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- The cost of the peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

Now, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:

\[
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:

\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Jairus's total earnings for 20 tasks.
2. Calculate Jenny's total earnings for 20 tasks.
3. Subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings to find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate Jairus's total earnings.**
Jairus gets $0.8 for each task. Since he completed 20 tasks:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]
So, Jairus gets $16.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars.
2. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.
3. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
   \[ B + 4B = 100 \]
4. Combining like terms, we get:
   \[ 5B = 100 \]
5. To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
   \[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]
6. So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
   \[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's sorted play set.
2. Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information given.

First, we know that James's play set has 80 toys. Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."

3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as for the previous three teeth. Since the previous amount was $1.00, half of that is $0.50. So, for two teeth, the total is \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, we add up all the amounts:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"Given that Richie scored 80 goals, and he scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find out how many goals Mark scored by subtracting 20 from Richie's total:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]
So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Next, since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can find out how many goals Anna scored by subtracting 45 from Richie's total:
\[ 80 - 45 = 35 \]
So, Anna scored 35 goals.

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
\[
\boxed{175}

"Peter has $70 to spend over the course of one week. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends $10 per day. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends $10 each day for 4 days, which totals $40. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he can buy:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

\[ 8 + 15 = 23 \]

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:

\[ \boxed{23} \]"

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (7) to find the average.

Let's start with the total number of birds:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Adding these together:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \]

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7):
\[ \frac{280}{7} = 40 \]

So, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is 40.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to in order to achieve the desired temperature of 520 degrees, given that her oven is 4% too hot when set to 450 degrees.

First, let's find out how much the oven is off by percentage:
- The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees.
- The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
- The percentage error is \(\frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\%\).

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error.

Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:
\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the total time into minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the total time for both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of the price of Herb's house and then subtract that from the price of Herb's house.

2. Subtract that amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

3. Now, add the value of both houses together:
\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, which means her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought = Judy's cups + Friend's cups = \(12 + 40 = 52\)
Total dishes brought = Judy's dishes + Friend's dishes = \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils brought by the two is the sum of the total cups and total dishes:
\[52 + 68 = 120\]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of one box of contacts after the discount. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount.

The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill. They are paid $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

The final answer is:
$40"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the number of blue jelly beans be \( B \).
2. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is:
   \[
   R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
   \]
3. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is:
   \[
   G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B
   \]
4. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   R + B + G = 4500
   \]
5. Substitute \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
   \[
   0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
   \]
6. Combine like terms:
   \[
   3B = 4500
   \]
7. Solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
   \]
8. Now, find the number of red and green jelly beans:
   \[
   R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week. To find the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we can calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

For Cheerios:
- Weekly weight loss: 1.25 pounds
- Total weight loss over 5 weeks: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

For Donuts:
- Weekly weight gain: 1.75 pounds
- Total weight gain over 5 weeks: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts is:
- Difference: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 pounds + 6.25 pounds = 15 pounds

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Jerry is currently \( J \) years old. The problem states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, 5 years ago, Jerry was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, his current age \( J \) is twice his age 5 years ago. This gives us the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. Each implant costs $2000, and George needs 2 implants, so the total for the implants is \(2 \times 2000 = \$4000\).
2. For one of the implants, he wants a porcelain crown, which adds an extra $500.
3. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is \(4000 + 500 = \$4500\).

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \(4500 - 600 = \$3900\).

George earns $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of these angles is:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
\[2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\]
\[3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\]

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."

"To solve this problem, we first need to find the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the distance and speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

\[
\boxed{5}

"Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. To find out how many pounds he can make in one hour, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa makes:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, we can calculate the total amount of chocolate they made together. Ruiz can make:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds in 12 hours} \]

And Marissa can make:

\[ 90 \times 12 = 1080 \text{ pounds in 12 hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together:

\[ 720 + 1080 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's break down Howard's spending over the three days:

- **Monday:** Howard spends $8.
- **Tuesday:** He spends twice as much as Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- **Wednesday:** He spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up his total spending:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, the amount of money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To find out how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - So, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

So, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To find the cost per pump of shampoo, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Washings per Bottle**: The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.
2. **Washings per Pump**: Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
   \[
   \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
   \]
3. **Cost per Washing**: The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
   \[
   \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
   \]
4. **Cost per Pump**: Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
   \]
5. **Convert to Cents**: Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out cost $35. 

First, calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts do not have a discount, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will have:
\[ 0 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

2. Determine the amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make these croissants."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

1. Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

2. Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

3. Calculate the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:
   - Difference in cost = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street."
"John starts with $100,000 for the first 5 months. Since the research takes 10 times longer, the total duration is 50 months. The first 5 months cost $100,000 each, so for 5 months, the cost is:

\[ 100,000 \times 5 = 500,000 \]

For the remaining 5 months, the cost per month is 50% more than the initial $100,000, which means each month costs:

\[ 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \]

So, for the remaining 5 months, the cost is:

\[ 150,000 \times 5 = 750,000 \]

Adding the costs together, the total cost is:

\[ 500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is \(\boxed{54}\)."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total cost to acquire the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission on the profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500

"Max bought stamps at the post office. He bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, which means he bought \(16 + 3 = 19\) truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought \(19 - 9 = 10\) rose stamps. Adding all the stamps together, we get \(16 + 19 + 10 = 45\).

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the difference in their speeds and then use that to determine the time it takes to close the gap.

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many classes Manny can miss without the cost per class exceeding $10. 

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.

Let's denote the number of classes Manny can miss as \( x \). Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The total cost is \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

So, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"Let's calculate the total cost of Bill's new truck step by step:

1. **Base price of the truck**: $30,000
2. **King cab upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7500}{3} = 2500
   \]
4. **Running boards**: $500 less than the leather seats
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2500 - 500 = 2000
   \]
5. **Upgraded exterior light package**: $1500

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary after a 5% raise:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary} = \$20000 + (0.05 \times \$20000) = \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, we add the bonus, which is half a month's salary:

\[ \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$20000 = \$10000 \]

So, his new monthly salary with the bonus is:

\[ \text{New Monthly Salary with Bonus} = \$21000 + \$10000 = \$31000 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary with the bonus by 12:

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$31000 \times 12 = \$372000 \]

Therefore, Tim will make \(\$372000\) in a year."
"James buys a new wardrobe. He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants. He also buys 3 dress shirts per suit. The suits cost $750 each, the dress pants cost 1/5 of the suit cost, and the dress shirts cost $60 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the suits:
- Each suit costs $750.
- James buys 10 suits.
- Total cost for suits = \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- Each dress pant costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the suit cost.
- Cost of one dress pant = \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
- James buys 10 dress pants.
- Total cost for dress pants = \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- He has 10 suits, so he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60.
- Total cost for dress shirts = \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Finally, let's sum up the total cost:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday. The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the initial cost for 20 pomegranates is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given:
- The total number of animal heads is 20.
- The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of heads: \( S + G = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ \begin{cases} 
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35 
\end{cases} \]

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Christina recorded her mood over 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Her first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Let's break it down:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 3 days: 2 good days (since the sequence is good, neutral, good)

So, the total number of good days is:
8 (from the first 8 days) + 2 (from the next 3 days) = 10 good days

Since she had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 - 10 = 2

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey has \( 2S + 3 \) books.

We are given that Janey has 21 books. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"The bamboo grows 30 inches per day and is currently 20 feet tall. First, convert the current height to inches:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The target height is 600 inches. Calculate the additional growth needed:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given the growth rate of 30 inches per day, determine the number of days required:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches in height.

\[
\boxed{12}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**
20"

"Given the information:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the cookies each person has:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let the original length of the dress be \( x \) cm.
2. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length, which is \( 0.5x \) cm.
3. She then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim.
4. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). So, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of one of the triplets as \( T \).
2. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of that twin is \( T + 7 \).
3. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   T + (T + 7) = 44
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2T + 7 = 44
   \]
5. Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( T \):
   \[
   2T = 37
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( T \):
   \[
   T = 18.5
   \]
7. Now, we can find the age of the twin:
   \[
   T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5

Therefore, John has \(\boxed{100}\) minutes to nap."
"First, let's find the cost of one candy. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

So, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, 10 lollipops will cost:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, 10 candies will cost:

\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:

\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. First, we calculate how many coins Neil saves each month:

"First, let's break down the costs:

1. The dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

2. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let the total bill be \( x \). Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is:
\[ 0.6x \]

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is:

"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To find the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to determine the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ blue squares}
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24 \text{ green squares}
   \]
4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12 \text{ white squares}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get for the function.

First, we know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we find the total number of chairs currently available at the restaurant:
\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

For the function, there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs needed is:
\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:
\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Next, we need to determine how much they raise per hour. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, we divide $2100 by 3:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

This means they raise $700 per hour. To find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide $4200 by $700:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for an additional 6 hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"The city of Colorado uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of that, 80% is used for industrial purposes. To find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for non-industrial purposes, we first calculate the industrial usage:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

This means 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes. To find the non-industrial usage, we subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To find out how many quarts of ice cream are made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then use those rates to determine the total production over 48 hours.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - So, the production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]
   - In 48 hours, the total production is:
     \[
     50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - So, the production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]
   - In 48 hours, the total production is:
     \[
     12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

3. **Total Production:**
   - Adding the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
     \]

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item Marcus ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Next, we add these amounts to find the total before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Now, we apply the 10% discount. A 10% discount means Marcus pays 90% of the total:
\[
\$50.00 \times 0.90 = \$45.00
\]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"Erin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

**Final Answer:**

"Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, we need to find out how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- Therefore, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the restaurant has \(\boxed{160}\) chairs left."
"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe to inches:
   - Topher's shoe length: 8 feet 4 inches
   - Convert feet to inches: \(8 \times 12 = 96\) inches
   - Add the remaining 4 inches: \(96 + 4 = 100\) inches

2. Set up the equation based on the given relationship:
   - Let \(x\) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
   - According to the problem, Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe:
     \[
     100 = 9x + 10
     \]

3. Solve for \(x\):
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     100 - 10 = 9x
     \]
     \[
     90 = 9x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 9:
     \[
     x = \frac{90}{9} = 10

"Cecelia found that a gallon jar of milk costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5, we can determine the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:

\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know the total number of students in the class is 50.
2. Out of these, 10 students like to bake.
3. 5 students like to play basketball.
4. The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music.
5. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.

First, calculate the number of students who like to play music:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, add the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:
\[ 10 \, (\text{baking}) + 5 \, (\text{basketball}) + 10 \, (\text{music}) = 25 \]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of students to find the number of students who like to play video games:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class, 40% of the students are girls. We need to find out how many boys are in each class.

First, we determine the number of students in each class:
\[
\text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Next, we calculate the number of girls in each class:
\[
\text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
\]

Finally, we find the number of boys in each class by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
\[
\text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
\]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"To find out how many chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Weekdays Calculation:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Weekend Calculation:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total Chairs in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total Chairs in Two 4-Week Months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which means it is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is given by:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies in series}
   \]
3. Each series movie costs $6, so:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The remaining movies are:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]
5. 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies}
   \]
6. Each older movie costs $5, so:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]
7. The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ normal movies}
   \]
8. Each normal movie costs $10, so:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
9. The total cost is the sum of the costs for series movies, older movies, and normal movies:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[
\boxed{4400}

"The Llesis family drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove for 4.5 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour and hiked for 1.5 hours at an average speed of 20 miles per hour (which is half of their driving speed minus 5 miles per hour).

First, calculate the distance they drove:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 4.5 \, \text{hours} \times 50 \, \text{miles per hour} = 225 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the distance they hiked:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 1.5 \, \text{hours} \times 20 \, \text{miles per hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, add the two distances to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 225 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 255 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance to the vacation spot is:
\[
\boxed{255}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Let \( E_t \) be the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

2. **Calculate Ava's Scores:**
   - Ava jumps on \( E_e + 8 \) enemies.
   - Ava collects \( E_b + 3 \) berries.
   - Ava finishes the level \( E_t + 4 \) seconds slower.

3. **Points Calculation:**
   - Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \) (number of enemies)
   - Points for berries: \( 5 \times \) (number of berries)
   - Points for time: \( 30 \times \) (seconds left on the timer)

4. **Emma's Total Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t
   \]

5. **Ava's Total Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215
   \]

6. **Difference in Scores:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 215
   \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total cost of four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, given that they cost the same amount.

First, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost:
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

This means the remaining cost for the other two pizzas is $34. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2:
\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas costs $17.

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which totals:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which totals:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding these together, the total number of rides in a week is:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish he bought is 17, so \(O + W = 17\).
2. After buying the fish, the number of orange fish is \(3 + O\) and the number of white fish is \(4 + W\). According to the problem, \(3 + O = 2(4 + W)\).

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(O + W = 17\)
2. \(O - 2W = 5\)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method. From the first equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):
\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the second equation:
\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]
\[17 - 3W = 5\]
\[-3W = 5 - 17\]
\[-3W = -12\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):
\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.
3. Both cars are on the highway for 2 hours.

To find out how far each car travels in 2 hours, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For the first car:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second car:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles separate the two cars after 2 hours, we subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"Milo is making a mosaic using glass chips. It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips contains 72 chips. Milo has two bags of glass chips and wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. We need to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be.

First, calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party by accounting for the tea consumed and the tea left.

First, let's calculate the amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
  \[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
  \[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. He then ordered 100 more candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
   \[
   200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. Each month, the number of students doubles. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

**310**"
"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - She drops 1 flower of each type, so she loses:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.
   - Total petals lost: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

4. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   - Subtract the lost petals from the total: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:

"John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, using a total of:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or lost is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Subtracting the used and dropped marshmallows from the original amount, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the 14 marshmallows left can be used to make 14 S'mores. If John and DeSean share these S'mores equally, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces.
   - Therefore, the equation is: \( z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \).

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms: \( 2z + 4s = 10 \).
   - Divide the entire equation by 2: \( z + 2s = 5 \).

4. **Solve for \( 2s \):**
   - From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that \( 2s \) is the amount of oil.
   - To find \( 2s \), we need to express \( z \) in terms of \( s \): \( z = 5 - 2s \).

5. **Determine the Value of \( 2s \):**
   - Since \( z \) and \( s \) must be positive and the total must be 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number.
   - For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \).
   - This satisfies the equation, and the amount of oil is \( 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \) ounces.

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. To find out how much money he spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we calculate the number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving away the cars. Initially, Joe had 40 cars. After selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars, the number of cars he has left is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations, so the amount raised by the students is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross a highway.

First, let's find the total distance the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos, each traveling at the same speed \(v\), take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

"Erika is saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one is reduced by $200, making the new price $400. Erika has some money in her purse, has been paid $150 for her part-time job, and her mom agrees to give her $80. She still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \).

The total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Adam starts by slicing 3 large apples and 5 small apples. Each large apple is sliced into 5 pieces, so from 3 large apples, he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices. Each small apple is sliced into 3 pieces, so from 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\).

Adam then eats 15 slices. So, the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently gets 5 liters of milk per day from one cow. With 3 cows, he gets:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Each glue stick originally is 12 millimeters long. We need to find out how much of each glue stick is not used.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   So, the unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   So, the unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   So, the unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help. To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we first add up the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \$10,000 + \$800 = \$10,800 \]

Next, we add up the money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \$5,000 + \$200 = \$5,200 \]

Now, we subtract the total money Gabriel has from the total cost to find out how much more he needs:

\[ \$10,800 - \$5,200 = \$5,600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs \(\$5,600\)."

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"Given the information:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To find out how many students are good at math, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both math and English. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

"Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. To find out how much she will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The simple interest formula is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"
"The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, so there are \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) white shirts with collars. This means there are \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) white shirts without collars.

For the floral shirts, 20 of them have buttons, so there are \( 50 - 20 = 30 \) floral shirts without buttons.

To find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars, we subtract the number of white shirts without collars from the number of floral shirts without buttons: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

Therefore, there are \(\boxed{10}\) more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we need to follow these steps:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the age of the brother as \( B \).
2. You are three years younger than your brother, so your age \( Q \) is \( B - 3 \).
3. You are two years older than your sister, so your sister's age \( S \) is \( Q - 2 \). Substituting \( Q = B - 3 \) into this, we get \( S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
4. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).
5. The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

Substituting \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
Adding 9 to both sides, we get:
\[ 6B = 96 \]
Dividing by 6, we get:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we can find your age \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"To find out how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens he plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost of the chickens.

First, let's find out how many chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for is:
\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we first need to determine how many glasses the boys sold in total:

\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:

\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final answer is:

"First, let's break down the costs of each item:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total cost of all items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. Therefore, the amount of money she has left in her budget is:
\[
65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.
2. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. This can be written as:
   \[
   2x + 15 = 65
   \]
3. To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x = 65 - 15
   \]
   \[
   2x = 50
   \]
4. Next, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{50}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the thingamabob first.

Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is \( 11v \). We know that \( 11v = 121 \) meters per second. Solving for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Now, since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[
5v = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J \) is an integer. Let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Finally, we add the material needed for the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

So, Jo needs \( \boxed{16} \) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. 

First, let's express their ages in terms of the current year:
- Duncan's age eight years ago: \(60 - 8 = 52\)
- Adam's age four years ago: \(A - 4\)

According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) was two times Adam's age four years ago. So we can write the equation:
\[52 = 2(A - 4)\]

Now, let's solve for \(A\):
\[52 = 2(A - 4)\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[26 = A - 4\]
Add 4 to both sides:
\[A = 30\]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[30 + 8 = 38\]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times 20 \text{ balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we subtract the pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total pieces to find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna, we divide the remaining pieces by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/balloon}} = 6 \text{ balloons} \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Jon drives 100 miles each day, so in 30 days, he drives:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours. Adding up the hours he works over the three days, we get \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. The cake cost $11, the balloons cost $3 (since 12 balloons at $0.5 for 2 balloons equals $3), and the ice cream cost $14 (2 tubs at $7 each). Adding these up, the total cost is:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]
Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance and combined it, each of them must have received half of the total amount. Therefore, each received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]
So, the amount each of them received from their mother is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. In total, she bought 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit. Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit, so the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12.

Final answer: 12"
"There are 6 students playing tennis. Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball, that means there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students playing volleyball. For soccer, there are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Adding these together, the total number of students is \(6 + 12 + 38 = 56\).

Therefore, the total number of students is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To find out how much money the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - There are 30 students.
   - Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \(30 \times 10 = 300\).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \(300 \times 0.8 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = \(300 \times 0.5 = 150\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Profit = \(240 - 150 = 90\) dollars.

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{47}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many berries the sloth picks per trip to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, let's figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours, the number of trips in 8 hours is:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks per trip. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of water in the tank:**
   - The pool has 10,000 gallons of water.
   - The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool.
   - Therefore, the tank has \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) gallons of water.

2. **Calculate the amount of water emptied from the tank:**
   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
   - Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied is \( 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \) gallons.

3. **Find the remaining amount of water in the tank:**
   - Subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank.
   - So, \( 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \) gallons remain.

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent so far:**
   - Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
   - He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
   - He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
   - He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

   Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
   \[
   50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining budget:**
   Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
   \[
   150 - 130 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost for the last day:**
   On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
   \[
   10 + 8 + 2 = 20
   \]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

Therefore, the total number of calories from the pastries Andrew baked is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day.
2. Sum the total number of Junebugs removed over the week.
3. Divide the total by the number of days to find the average.

Here are the details:

- **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
- **Tuesday**: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Wednesday**: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
- **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add 39 and 78:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add 78:

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add 48:

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add 57:

\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days (5):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. The distance traveled by the bus is calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. The distance traveled by the car is calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

And Peter’s age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

First, substitute \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

First, let's calculate the total distance spat by Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds, and each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

Next, let's calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds, and each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Now, we find the average total distance spat by both:
- The total distance spat by both is \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.
- The average total distance spat is \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."

"To find out how much commission Cayley will earn, we need to calculate the commission from both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then add them together.

1. **New York Times:**
   - Each copy costs $5.
   - Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
   - He sells 6 copies.
   
   The commission per copy is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The total commission from 6 copies is:
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Each copy costs $15.
   - Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
   - He sells 10 copies.
   
   The commission per copy is:
   \[
   15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The total commission from 10 copies is:
   \[
   10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Adding the commissions from both newspapers:
   \[
   3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can find Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from 26.

Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored a total of 45 points. We also know that:
1. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
2. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. The book is 1.5 inches thick.

To find the total number of pages in the book, we first calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate. Since 1 inch of paper accommodates 100 pages, 1.5 inches will accommodate:

\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

However, since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we divide the total number of pages by 2:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he staples from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we calculate the total number of reports stapled:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The time from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total time awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. To find the number of measuring spoons, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons}
\]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons}
\]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:

\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds. Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied, which means 200 beds are occupied. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Each day, 50 patients are admitted. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

After 2 weeks, the total number of occupied beds is 200 (initially occupied) + 700 (new admissions) = 900 beds.

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 1000 (total capacity) - 900 (occupied beds) = 100 beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is **100**."
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are sent to her family. The problem states that two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. So, the number of emails sent to family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means the remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are sent to her boyfriend. The number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

The problem also states that one-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

"If Courtney reported that 48 people attended the concert and Kelly said Courtney had overstated the number by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people who attended.

Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \). According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be written as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day:** The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day:** They dug 13 more holes.
3. **Third Day:** They dug 8 holes but filled in 2, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

We know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. Since they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. To find the cost of the tickets, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the total cost of the tickets is:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).
2. According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).
4. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
   \]
5. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
   \]
   \[
   9A - 21 = 339
   \]
6. Add 21 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   9A = 360
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 9:
   \[
   A = 40
   \]
8. Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
   \[
   4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
   \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long. We are told that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes, half of that is 10. So, there are 10 episodes in total.

"To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up all the times:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

**Final Answer:** 227 minutes"

The first two phones cost:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can plug these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need \(\boxed{100}\) wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. This leaves her with \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes. She then kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \(2\) boxes. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes.

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The average is calculated by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed.

First, let's convert the width of each plant from inches to feet. Since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot, each plant takes up 1 foot of space.

Next, we need to account for the space between the plants. Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant, including the space between them, is:
\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Now, we need to find out how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:
\[\frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4\]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants.

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:
\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:
\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[\boxed{162}\]"
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 pretzels a day. So, his brother eats \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pretzels a day. 

In a week, which has 7 days, his brother eats \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \) pretzels.

Therefore, the answer is 63."
"To find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants she wants to add to each basket.

First, let's calculate the total number of petunias needed:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

Now, let's determine the cost of the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

Next, let's determine the cost of the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

Finally, let's add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
- Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"Artemis and her father bought a 30-pound bag of soil to plant flowers. Each rose needs 1 pound, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds. They decided to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

First, calculate the soil needed for the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the soil needed for the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtract the total soil used from the total soil available to find the remaining soil for roses:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. First, we calculate how much she sets aside each month:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. To find out how much she can save in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs she can buy in a year, we divide her yearly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

**Final Answer:**
6"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Emily to both peel and sauté 90 shrimp.

First, let's break down the tasks:
1. **Peeling Shrimp**: Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
2. **Sautéing Shrimp**: Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.

Now, let's calculate the time required for each task for 90 shrimp:
1. **Peeling 90 Shrimp**:
   - Since she peels 6 shrimp per minute, the time to peel 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing 90 Shrimp**:
   - Since she sautés 3 shrimp per minute, the time to sauté 90 shrimp is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks (peeling and sauturing) need to be done sequentially, we add the times together:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer:**
45 minutes"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer:**

"Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age when he saw the comet.

First, calculate Bill's dad's age when he saw the comet:
\[ \text{Dad's age} = 30 \text{ years old} \]

Next, calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:
\[ \text{Bill's age} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years. Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is:
\[ \text{Bill's age} = 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

So, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Electric Bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas Bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which also totals:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and Lawn Service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we add all these up:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights are to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means the remaining flights are \( \frac{1}{4}F \), and each of France and Germany get half of that, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

4. The second plane makes 44 flights, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes. So, we can write:
   \[
   F = 2 \times 44 = 88
   \]

5. Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the total flights \( F \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
   \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"Given the information:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.

First, let's find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[3 + 4 = 7\]

Since the total age of all four children is 20, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
\[20 - 7 = 13\]

Next, we know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[\frac{20}{4} = 5\]

So, Helene's age is:
\[2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
\[13 - 10 = 3\]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."

So, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We have a family of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

The total number of slices is:
- 2 adults each getting \(2x\), so \(2 \times 2x = 4x\)
- 4 kids each getting \(x\), so \(4 \times x = 4x\)

Adding these together, the total size of the watermelon is:
\[4x + 4x = 8x\]

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

   x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3
   \]

4. **Final Charge**: We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]

5. **Calculate the Values**:
   \[
   (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032
   \]
   \[
   (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357
   \]

6. **Substitute and Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x \times 0.501872 \approx 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578
   \]

7. **Round to Nearest Whole Number**: The initial charge of the power bank is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the prices and relationships:**
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Define the quantities sold:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is \(2x \times 4 = 8x\).
   - The total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is \(x \times 12 = 12x\).
   - The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is \(8x + 12x = 20x\).

4. **Use the total earnings to find \(x\):**
   - We know the total earnings are $120, so we set up the equation \(20x = 120\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\).

5. **Find the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   - Since the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\), we have \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."

"To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\(\boxed{89.8\%}\)"

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Winning amount: \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know Cole's original height is 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that three people divided $1920. Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Next, we subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

**Final Answer:**
47.25"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) tennis balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, which means there are \(50 \times \frac{1}{2} = 25\) English books. Additionally, 10% of the books are written in German, so there are \(50 \times 0.1 = 5\) German books. The rest of the books are written in Spanish. Therefore, the number of Spanish books is calculated by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[50 - 25 - 5 = 20\]

So, the number of Spanish books is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"The total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. If Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers, we can find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive by subtracting the distance she has already covered from the total distance.

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off, and twice that number (100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people get off. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"To find out how much it will cost to renovate your kitchen floor with new square tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"James's insurance cost increased by 60% after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month. First, we calculate the increase in cost:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays a year is \(\boxed{2304}\)."
"To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year.
2. Determine how many loads of laundry are needed based on the machine's capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year.**

- Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
- Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

**Step 2: Determine the number of loads needed.**

- The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
- The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

**Step 3: Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year.**

- Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch a total of \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Donovan's part of the meal took \(D\) minutes.
2. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes.
3. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   D + (D + 18) = 98
   \]
4. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2D + 18 = 98
   \]
5. Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \(D\):
   \[
   2D = 80
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(D\):
   \[
   D = 40

"Maggie and Riza each have $60 left after spending some of their money. Let's break it down:

1. **Maggie's Initial Amount:**
   - Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left.
   - This means $60 is three-quarters of her original amount.
   - If we let \( M \) be Maggie's original amount, then \(\frac{3}{4}M = 60\).
   - Solving for \( M \), we get \( M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \).
   - So, Maggie originally had $80.

2. **Riza's Initial Amount:**
   - Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left.
   - This means $60 is two-thirds of her original amount.
   - If we let \( R \) be Riza's original amount, then \(\frac{2}{3}R = 60\).
   - Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \).
   - So, Riza originally had $90.

3. **Total Money Left:**
   - Maggie has $60 left.
   - Riza has $60 left.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money they have left is \( 60 + 60 = 120 \).

So, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."

2. **First Monkey's Consumption:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - In a week, the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

3. **Second Monkey's Consumption:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - So, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - In a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

4. **Third Monkey's Consumption:**
   - Let the third monkey eat \(x\) bananas each day.
   - In a week, the third monkey eats \(7x\) bananas.

5. **Total Bananas Equation:**
   - The total bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315.
   - Therefore, the equation is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, the cost of one rose is:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, the cost of 15 roses is:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Leaves after 30 minutes (10 minutes to arrive + 20 minutes to stay).

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (30 minutes from the start).
   - Stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of the first train's stay time, which is 20 minutes / 4 = 5 minutes).
   - Leaves after 45 minutes (30 minutes to arrive + 15 minutes to stay).

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (60 minutes from the start).
   - Leaves immediately after arriving, so it leaves at 60 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (80 minutes from the start).
   - This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes). The fourth train arrives at 80 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for 80 minutes.

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved, we multiply the number of toothpicks per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The original price of the watch is $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
4. Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch.
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - The friend bought it for $1800.
   - The discount amount is:
     \[
     \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
     \]
   - The percentage discount is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
     \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."

"First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas.

Total bananas from bunches = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

If Jenny were to buy these bananas individually, at $0.80 each, the total cost would be:

Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

Since she bought the bananas in bunches for $3.00 per bunch, the total cost for 10 bunches is:

Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

To find out how much money she saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the total cost for bunches from the total cost for individual bananas:

Money saved = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence. Harry is supposed to get 60 feet more than Sam. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. Therefore, Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total length of the fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get, which is:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we need to isolate \( S \). We do this by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine its growth rate per year. Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can calculate the annual growth rate as follows:

\[ \text{Annual growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the annual growth rate by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
   - BMX bikes: \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
   - MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \)

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of a Trekking bike: $450
   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times 450 = 67500 \)
   - Price of a BMX bike: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \)
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: \( 45 \times 250 = 11250 \)
   - Price of an MTB bike: $500
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: \( 105 \times 500 = 52500 \)

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings: \( 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \)

"The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour. This means that each hour, the net increase in the number of hay bales in the field is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales. Over a 6-hour day, the total number of bales added to the field is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"John has 8 classes in a week, each lasting 40 minutes. He goes to class 5 days a week, so the total class time during the weekdays is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

On the weekends, he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each day. So, the extra learning time per day on the weekend is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of it, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
3. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
4. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"First, let's calculate the area of each wall:

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"The problem states that there were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. Each bus carried 35 people, and each car carried 3 people. We need to find out how many people were inside the church, but the problem does not provide the exact number of people in each vehicle that attended the ceremony. Therefore, we can only calculate the maximum possible number of people that could have been transported.

First, calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Since the problem does not specify how many of these people actually attended the ceremony, the final numerical answer based on the given information is:

"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, calculate the total time for breaks each day:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, which totals \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes

So, each day, Bobby spends \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes on lunch and breaks.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
- \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}\)

"Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we need to find the total population of the school first. Let's denote the total population by \( P \).

Since 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. Therefore, the number of girls is:
\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days in June**: June has 30 days.
2. **Total Miles to Hike**: Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.
3. **Planned Miles per Day**: Soledad plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, she plans to hike:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
   \]
4. **Required Miles per Day**: To find out how many miles per day she needs to hike to complete 9,300 miles in 30 days, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day}
   \]
5. **Additional Miles Needed per Day**: The difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day is:
   \[
   310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"To find out how much the store will have received after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the revenue from red balls:
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

2. Calculate the revenue from blue balls:
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \(11 \times 5 = 55\)

3. Calculate the revenue from green balls:
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \(25 \times 3 = 75\)

4. Sum the revenues from all the balls:
   - Total revenue: \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\)

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought a total of 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of the total, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples is 12 kg, so the amount left for Jacques (or James) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It dropped by 8 degrees, so the new temperature is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Anna had a budget of $16 and has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount. She has $2 left in her budget. To find out how much each book cost, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount spent: 
   \[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]
   So, Anna spent $14 in total.

2. Subtract the amount spent before buying the books today:
   \[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]
   This means she spent $10 on the 2 books today.

3. Since both books cost the same amount, divide the total spent on the books by 2:
   \[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]
   Therefore, each book cost $5.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students this year, we first calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, the increase in enrollment is 10 students. Adding this to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"To find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to determine the rate at which the light blinks. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. So, the rate of blinking is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

The final answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of fish:

- Total male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Total female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Total male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Total female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Next, we find the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: \(6 \text{ (male guppies)} + 5 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8 \text{ (female guppies)} + 8 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 16\)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of female and male fishes:

- Difference: \(16 - 11 = 5\)

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.
2. Megan spent 2 hours longer than Amalia walking the dog, so Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior spent more than 4 hours longer than Amalia doing laundry, so Dior spent at least \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 8 hours, we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we add up the time spent by each person:
\[4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19\]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"John visits his parents twice a month. Each visit involves a round trip that takes 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.

First, calculate the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the round trip distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance he drives in a month is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 2 \times 280 \, \text{miles} = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

The toy manufacturer needs to produce 400 toys. There are 5 workers, and by the end of their 10-hour shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order. This means that the workers have produced \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys in total.

We know the production rates of the first four workers:
- Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- Another two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The total production of all five workers is 380 toys, so the fifth worker must have produced:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total production of the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour}\]

So, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[
\boxed{18}

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris received 7 stickers from Luis and kept 9 stickers. So, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all 16 stickers he had to Kris, which means Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the 32 stickers Luis had must be half of what Seth originally had. Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

\[

"John buys 3 large bags of M&M, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight of M&M is:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce, the total number of M&M he has is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&M per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&M}}{10 \text{ M&M per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance, given that he flies 400 kilometers every day.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we need to follow these steps:

The answer is 9."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so if Arnold painted \(A\) eggs, Madeline also painted \(A\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. If Sarah painted \(S\) eggs, then Camden painted \(S + 12\) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

We can set up the following equations based on the information given:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \(S = 9\) back into the equation \(A + S = 22\):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted \(S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\) eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Nik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8. To find out how many groups he can make, we divide 200 by 8:
\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]
So, Nik will have 25 groups of crayons, and each group will go into a box. Since each box weighs 8 ounces and each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]
The total weight of the boxes is:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]
Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]
To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor 16 ounces per pound:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]
So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the usable part of the tree:**

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, which is $15000 \times 2 = $30000 per month. Adding all their salaries together, we get $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 per month.

The total amount of money they all have together is \(\boxed{45000}\)."
"To find out how long it takes Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we need to calculate the time spent on both the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Time on the Beach:**
   - Given: 40 minutes.
   - Distance on the beach: 2 miles.
   - Speed on the beach: Let's call it \( v \) miles per minute.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \), we get \( 40 = \frac{2}{v} \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we find \( v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

2. **Speed on the Sidewalk:**
   - Given: The speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach.
   - So, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.

3. **Distance on the Sidewalk:**
   - Given: 1 mile.

4. **Time on the Sidewalk:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \), the time spent on the sidewalk is \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \) minutes.

5. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply the amount saved per week by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane's goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28 by dividing the amount she needs by the amount she saves each week:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many marbles Bob originally has. The problem states that if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the original number of marbles Bob has:
   \[
   \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60
   \]
   Solving for the original number of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36

2. Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. Since he originally has 36 marbles, after losing 10 marbles, he will have:
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water so that the mixture in the water bottle is at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"Russell orders his favorite bagels online. Each pack contains 9 bagels and costs $10.00. If he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount. First, calculate the total cost before the discount:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00 \text{ per pack} = \$40.00 \]

Next, apply the 10% discount:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$40.00 = 0.10 \times \$40.00 = \$4.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[ \$40.00 - \$4.00 = \$36.00 \]

Russell gets 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels per pack} = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

"First, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This simplifies to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which totals to:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Then, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, which totals to:

"Given the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84, we can set up the problem as follows:

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women, so we have:
\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[54 - 20 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To find the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break it down year by year:

- **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
- **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
- **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining money for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister, so:

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \(0.20 \times 100 = 20\) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \(100 + 20 = 120\) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The cost per pod is \(\frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}\).

3. **Determine how many cycles you can run for $1:**
   - Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, and each pod costs $0.10, for $1 you can buy \(\frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods}\).
   - Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

So, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is \(\boxed{10}\)."

- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. This means he has 5 - (5 * 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

- After the first day: 2.75 * 0.80 = 2.20 inches
- After the second day: 2.20 * 0.80 = 1.76 inches
- After the third day: 1.76 * 0.80 = 1.408 inches
- After the fourth day: 1.408 * 0.80 = 1.1264 inches
- After the fifth day: 1.1264 * 0.80 = 0.90112 inches

Since 0.90112 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

First, calculate the number of girls on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

Next, calculate the number of boys on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students to find the number of students not on varsity:
\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of face masks that Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks. So, thrice the number of Mike's face masks is \(3 \times 5 = 15\). Adding 2 more to that gives \(15 + 2 = 17\).

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The answer is 17."
"James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of teeth capped: Since the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, the number of capped teeth is \(4 + 7 = 11\).
2. Calculate the total number of teeth fixed: The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
3. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed: The percentage of teeth fixed is given by \(\left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 50\%\).

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. The total cost was:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.
2. According to the first piece of information, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This can be written as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]
3. According to the second piece of information, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

First, simplify the first equation:
\[
W = 5C + 35
\]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[
W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135
\]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45
\]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000, we divide $27,000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Therefore, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Since Bob is distributing these books among 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find out how much Ali's coal order costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many 50 kg bags are needed to deliver 850 kg of coal.
2. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of 50 kg bags required:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat and then figure out how many whole pizza pies are required.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices each friend will eat:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices for each type of pizza is:
- Cheese pizza: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Next, we need to determine how many whole pizza pies are required for each type of pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. So, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies together, we get:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}
\]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the net gain of snowballs per 15 minutes:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs every 15 minutes.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Calculate the time needed to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - Since Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.
   - The number of 15-minute intervals needed is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert the time into hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"When Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it came out 20 years ago. John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old. The problem states that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old. Since 20 years have passed since then, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is now 24 years old."
"Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister. 

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Adding these up: 1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices they all ate is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The difference is \(109 - 78 = 31\), which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

"John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is:

"Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor to the ceiling is:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Let's denote the height of the second floor as \( h \). Therefore:
\[ 180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches} \]

To find \( h \), we solve the equation:
\[ h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average. Since the average is 3 miles per day for 4 dogs, the total is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much John gets as a loan. His house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that.

72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
2. John's classes each have \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
   \]
3. Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
   \]
4. The capacity of Ali's school is simply the capacity of his one class, which is 120 students.
5. Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:
   \[
   \text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
   \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is \(\boxed{150}\)."

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the eggs. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Skyler has a total of 100 hats. Half of these hats are red, so the number of red hats is:
\[
\frac{100}{2} = 50
\]
After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is:
\[
100 - 50 = 50
\]
Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]
The rest of the hats are white. Therefore, the number of white hats is:
\[
50 - 30 = 20
\]

The number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes in bags of 30 sticks and costs $18.00 per bag. There is a $3.00 discount on the bag, so the price after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

To find the cost per stick, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since we need the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The total number of questions is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

So, she needs to get:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

questions correct in total.

Next, we calculate how many questions she got correct on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

To find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are given that Mary makes some strawberry cubes, denoted as \( S \), and the number of blueberry cubes, denoted as \( B \), is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's break down the time taken for each side of the Rubik's cube:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes

Adding these times together:

"First, let's figure out John's new speaking speed. His original speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and after training, he is 2.5 times faster.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of words John needs to speak. Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes for John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speaking speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day, so the number of people was:
\[50 + 20 = 70\]

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, so the number of people was:
\[2 \times 70 = 140\]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Therefore, the total number of people he saw from day 4 to day 7 is:
\[60 \times 4 = 240\]

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from each day:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

\]

The average of their ages is 48."
"To find the total number of good seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found by adding the seashells found by each person.
2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells found.

First, let's add the seashells found by each person:
- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

Adding these together:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 \]

Next, we subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:
- Number of cracked seashells = 67

So, the total number of good seashells is:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is \(\boxed{665}\)."

"Dexter has five pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption for all the pigs over the week.

1. **Daily Feed Consumption for One Pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for All Five Pigs:**
   Dexter has five pigs, so the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption for All Five Pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Remaining Feed After a Week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the remaining feed after a week is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. So, the number of packs he needs to buy is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"First, let's calculate the total money Frances earns from selling cupcakes and cookies.

- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:

  \[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \]
  So, she earns $40 from cookies.

Adding these amounts together, the total money earned is:
\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five trays she buys:
- Each tray costs $4, and she buys five trays:
  \[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
  So, the total cost of the trays is $20.

Subtracting the total cost of the trays from the total money earned, we get:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Frances has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - Number of new children joining = 5 (one for each of the original 5 children).
   - Total number of children now = 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - Number of new children joining = 10 (original 10 children) × 2 = 20.
   - Total number of children now = 10 (original) + 20 (new) = 30.

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children leave the group.
   - Total number of children now = 30 (current total) - 5 (original 5 children who left) = 25.

So, the final number of children following the truck is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.
2. All 3 sisters are 16 years old.
3. One brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.

From the information given, we can determine the age of the older brother:
- Since the 12-year-old brother is half the age of the older brother, the older brother must be \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings:
- The total age of the 3 sisters: \(3 \times 16 = 48\)
- The age of the 12-year-old brother: \(12\)
- The age of the older brother: \(24\)

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, which is given as 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[24 + x = 29\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

"The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

The vendor sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price per watermelon, we calculate the cost price per watermelon plus 25% of the cost price:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dora's Current Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's Current Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - So, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's Current Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is now 18, John is now \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the Age of the Youngest Son:**
   - The youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is now 37, the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
8

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour and then find the difference.

1. Calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"First, let's calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount. The original cost is $400, and he gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( k \) be the number of cows.
2. We know that the total number of animals is 20, so:
   \[ c + k = 20 \]
3. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70, so:
   \[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]
4. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[ c + 2k = 35 \]
5. Now we have the system of equations:
   \[ c + k = 20 \]
   \[ c + 2k = 35 \]
6. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   \[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
   \[ k = 15 \]
7. Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
   \[ c + 15 = 20 \]
   \[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

The final answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
