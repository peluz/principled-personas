"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So, the total number of eggs she uses each day is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. 

The number of eggs left to sell at the farmers' market is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. 

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount of money she makes from selling the eggs is 9 * $2 = $18.

So, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is \(\boxed{18}\) dollars."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. Josh buys a house for $80,000.
2. He spends $50,000 on repairs.
3. The repairs increase the value of the house by 150%.

First, we need to find out how much the repairs increased the value of the house. Since the increase is 150%, we calculate 150% of $80,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to find out the total cost Josh spent:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.
2. Wendi has 20 chickens.
3. So, the total feed needed for all chickens in a day is:
   \[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

4. In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
5. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed.
6. The total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
   \[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

7. To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the feed already given from the total daily feed requirement:
   \[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

So, for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. Since he buys them in pairs, we divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs there are: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:**
$64"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - So, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - So, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - To find the total number of sheep, we add the sheep from all three cities:
   - Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
   - Total sheep = \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\)

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\).

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\).

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB per minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\).

   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\).

So, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John drives for 4 hours to try to get home.
   - First, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - Then, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at $10 per hour.
   - So, her regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - She worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - So, her overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, the total cost for donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, the total cost for mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, the total cost for mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost for donuts: $204
- Total cost for mini cupcakes: $160
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes: $330

So, the total cost is \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 to plant. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money.

First, let's calculate the net profit each year:
- Revenue from selling lemons: \(7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}\)
- Cost to water and feed the tree: \$3/\text{year}
- Net profit each year: \(\$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}\)

Next, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90:
- Number of years to break even: \(\frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}\)

So, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Melanie started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners.
2. She sold a third of them at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
5. Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
6. Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
7. Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
8. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

1. First, we know there are 20 students in the dance class.
2. 20% of these students enrolled in contemporary dance. So, we calculate:
   \[
   20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]
3. After 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students left}
   \]
4. Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate:
   \[
   25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students}
   \]
5. After 4 students enrolled in jazz dance, we have:
   \[
   16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students left}
   \]
6. These 12 students are the ones who enrolled in hip-hop dance.
7. To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:
   \[
   \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\%
   \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is \(\boxed{60\%}\)."

The merchant has two choices:
1. Jewelry worth $5,000
2. Electronic gadgets worth $8,000

The financial advisor predicts:
- The jewelry market will go up by 2.5%.
- The electronic gadgets market will go up by 1.2%.

First, let's calculate the new value of the jewelry:
- Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
- Increase: 2.5%
- New value: \(5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125\)

Next, let's calculate the new value of the electronic gadgets:
- Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
- Increase: 1.2%
- New value: \(8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096\)

Now, let's find the profit for each:
- Profit from jewelry: \(5125 - 5000 = 125\)
- Profit from electronic gadgets: \(8096 - 8000 = 96\)

So, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize profit.

"Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31 years old, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, let's figure out Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. So, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]

This means Raymond's son is currently:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract his current age from Samantha's current age:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, Raymond's son was born \(\boxed{2}\) years ago."

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after getting a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 is the price after the discount, which is 75% of the original price.

Let's call the original price \( P \).

Since $19.50 is 75% of the original price, we can write:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find the original price \( P \), we need to divide both sides by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was \(\boxed{26}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. We know one pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.
4. The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \(B\), then:
   \[ B - 5 = 99 \]
5. To find \(B\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[ B = 99 + 5 \]
   \[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means if Darrell's age is 7 parts, Allen's age is 11 parts.

The total of these parts is their combined age, which is 162 years. So, we can write:
\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]
where \( x \) is the value of each part.

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 18x = 162 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 18:
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \]

Now, we know that each part is 9 years. Allen's age is 11 parts, so:
\[ 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

Allen's age 10 years from now will be:
\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has 10 dogs.
2. Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business.
3. To find out how many hours John spends each day, we multiply the number of dogs by the hours each dog needs:
   \[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]
4. There are 7 days in a week, so to find out how many hours John spends in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:
   \[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. Also, she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Then the number of gold coins would be \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, so we can write:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Now, divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
\[ G = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we know Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Then, we add 5 to 20 to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from 25 to find out how many jewels Siobhan has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

So, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, in 30 days he will eat:
   \[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. We do this by dividing 60 by 4:
   \[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

3. Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
   \[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"John sells his lego sets and uses the money to buy video games. He sells 13 lego sets for $15 each. So, the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20. The total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the money he spent on video games plus the $5 left equals the total money he had from selling the lego sets. So, the money he spent on video games and the leftover is:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold a certain number of lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, 3 hours on the first day, and half as much on the other two days.

First, let's figure out how far he runs on the other two days. Since he runs half as much as the first day on each of those days, he runs:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, on each of the other two days, he runs:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times v \text{ miles per hour} = 1.5v \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's add up all the distances:
- First day: \( 3v \text{ miles} \)
- Second day: \( 1.5v \text{ miles} \)
- Third day: \( 1.5v \text{ miles} \)

Total distance in a week:
\[ 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v \text{ miles} \]

We know the total distance is 60 miles, so:
\[ 6v = 60 \]

Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so:
     \[
     3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so:
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running (one-third of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking (two-thirds of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Add the distances:
     \[
     12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
     \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."

   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\) years old."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone.
2. When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than usual.
3. So, the throwing distance with the gemstone is \(400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}\).
4. The dragon can breathe fire within 1000 feet.
5. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance: \(1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}\).

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find out how many calories are in one gram of chips:**
   - A 300g bag has 1250 calories (since 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories).
   - So, 1 gram of chips has \( \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \).

2. **Calculate how many calories you can still consume:**
   - Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - So, you can still consume \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \).

3. **Determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Since 1 gram of chips has 4.17 calories, you can eat \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \).

So, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To make 20 candles, he needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - For 2 pounds, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - For 20 candles, the revenue is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many articles Meredith wrote each day.

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's add up the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. We need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she bought.

First, let's figure out how many Post-it notes she had before using any at work. If she had 23 left after using 220, we can add those 220 back to the 23 to find out how many she had before using them:

\[ 23 + 220 = 243 \]

So, before using any at work, she had 243 Post-it notes. Since she started with 80, the difference must be the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought:

\[ 243 - 80 = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties:**
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Number of blue ties = Total spent on blue ties / Cost per blue tie
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5

2. **Determine the number of red ties:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 × Number of blue ties
   - Number of red ties = 2 × 5 = 10

3. **Determine the cost of each red tie:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Cost of each red tie = Cost of each blue tie + 50% of the cost of each blue tie
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + 0.5 × $40 = $40 + $20 = $60

4. **Calculate the total cost of red ties:**
   - Total cost of red ties = Number of red ties × Cost per red tie
   - Total cost of red ties = 10 × $60 = $600

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on ties:**
   - Total amount spent = Total spent on blue ties + Total spent on red ties
   - Total amount spent = $200 + $600 = $800

So, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\)."

2. **Occupied Units**: We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

3. **Unoccupied Units**: To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units. So, \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day:**
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - So, the number of dozens of eggs per day is \( \frac{252}{12} = 21 \) dozen.

2. **Calculate the daily earnings from selling the eggs:**
   - Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
   - Therefore, his daily earnings are \( 21 \text{ dozen} \times 2 \text{ dollars/dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars} \).

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings from selling the eggs:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, his weekly earnings are \( 42 \text{ dollars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 294 \text{ dollars/week} \).

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."

On his way back, he travels at 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he decides to remove 30 comic books. So, the total weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

This means he still needs to remove:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys he needs to remove is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On Thursday:
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires at $60 each, so the revenue from truck tires is \(6 \times 60 = \$360\).
- The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is \(4 \times 40 = \$160\).
- The total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = \$520\).

On Friday:
- The mechanic repaired 12 car tires at $40 each, so the revenue from car tires is \(12 \times 40 = \$480\).
- Since no truck tires were repaired, the revenue from truck tires is \(0\).
- The total revenue for Friday is \(480 + 0 = \$480\).

Now, to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue:
- The revenue on Thursday is \$520.
- The revenue on Friday is \$480.
- The difference is \(520 - 480 = \$40\).

So, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."

Aleena pays $140 per month for the streaming service. There are 12 months in a year, so we can split the year into two halves, each with 6 months.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - For 6 months, she pays $140 each month.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The company charges 10% less for the second half.
   - 10% of $140 is \( 140 \times 0.10 = 14 \) dollars.
   - So, the reduced monthly charge is \( 140 - 14 = 126 \) dollars.
   - For 6 months, she pays $126 each month.
   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**

So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to figure out her car's fuel efficiency first. We know that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. So, we can calculate her car's miles per gallon (mpg) by dividing the miles traveled by the gallons of gas used:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know her car can go 25 miles for every gallon of gas. Since her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total gallons in the tank:

\[ \text{Miles on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Girls' Basketball Teams:**
   - Each school has 1 girls' team.
   - Each team has 5 players.
   - There are 4 schools.
   - So, the total number of girls' players is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

2. **Boys' Basketball Teams:**
   - Each school has 1 boys' team.
   - Each team has 5 players.
   - There are 4 schools.
   - So, the total number of boys' players is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

3. **Coaches:**
   - Each school sends 1 coach for the girls' team and 1 coach for the boys' team.
   - So, each school sends 2 coaches.
   - There are 4 schools.
   - Therefore, the total number of coaches is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Now, let's add everything up:
- Girls' players: 20
- Boys' players: 20
- Coaches: 8

The total number of people is \(20 + 20 + 8 = 48\).

So, the final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know there are 175 diamonds.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. So, we calculate the number of rubies as:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we calculate the number of emeralds as:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]
4. To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
   \[
   175 + 140 + 280 = 595
   \]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is \(\boxed{595}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know there are 60 girls at the school.
2. The number of boys is twice the number of girls, so we calculate:

   \]
3. Now, we find the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   120 + 60 = 180 \text{ students}
   \]
4. We are told that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:
   \[
   \frac{180}{5} = 36 \text{ teachers}
   \]

So, the number of teachers is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The top level (Level 1) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
2. The second level (Level 2) will have half the square footage of the top level, so it's \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
3. The third level (Level 3) will have half the square footage of the second level, so it's \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
4. The fourth level (Level 4) will have half the square footage of the third level, so it's \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

Now, let's add up the square footage of all the levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

"Cecilia just bought a new puppy. The vet said she needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then, she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days.

1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food each day.
2. So, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:
   \[
   180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, we need to find out how many bags are needed for 180 cups.
4. We divide 180 cups by 110 cups per bag:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636
   \]

5. Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. So, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.00. He wants to buy 18 flowers and save money by choosing the better deal.

First, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- He needs 6 packages (since \(18 \div 3 = 6\)).
- The cost is \(6 \times 2.50 = 15.00\) dollars.

Next, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- He needs 9 packages (since \(18 \div 2 = 9\)).
- The cost is \(9 \times 1.00 = 9.00\) dollars.

The better deal is buying in packages of 2, which costs $9.00. The original cost of buying in packages of 3 is $15.00. So, the savings is:
\[ 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"John takes his dog to the groomer, which costs $100. The groomer gives him a 30% discount because he is a new customer. To find out how much the grooming costs after the discount, we first calculate the discount amount:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know the football team played a total of 22 games. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use some simple math to figure this out.

1. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \).
2. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won would be \( L + 8 \).

Now, the total number of games played is the sum of the games won and the games lost, which is 22. So, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

3. Gerald improved his speed by 10%. This means he can now run 90% of his original time. So, we calculate 90% of 40 seconds:
   \[
   40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood.
2. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs. So, the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
3. The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).
4. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).
5. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many boys there are. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 200 students are boys. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
   \]
   So, there are 80 boys.

2. Next, we need to find out how many girls there are. Since the rest of the students are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:
   \[
   200 - 80 = 120
   \]
   So, there are 120 girls.

3. Now, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
   \]
   So, 80 girls are in the girl scout.

4. Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
   \[
   120 - 80 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 girls are not in the girl scout.

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is \(\boxed{40}\)."

"When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes contains three tomatoes. Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How many tomatoes did Freda use?

To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Volume Loss**: Each can of tomatoes, when cooked, loses half its volume. So, a 16-ounce can of tomatoes will produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Number of Cans Needed**: Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we need to find out how many cans are needed:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Total Number of Tomatoes**: To find the total number of tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam. Let's call the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).

Now, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary received 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. She already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, she originally had:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ potted plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

After giving away 40 potted plants, she will have:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \text{ potted plants} \]

Then, she receives 18 more potted plants. So, the total number of potted plants she will have is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend pressed it \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so the third friend pressed it \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 \]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is \( \boxed{175} \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of pages Solo has to read. He has to read:
- 4 pages from his Science textbook
- 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook
- 7 pages from his History textbook
- 8 pages from his Geography textbook

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Next, we know that Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages left to read is:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day on average, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed, every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On weekends, he has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which equals 6 glasses of water on the weekends.

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together: 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses of water in a week.

**Final Answer: 26**"
"To figure out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can use a simple method.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. The city is 42 miles across.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles. We do this by dividing 42 by 3:
\[ 42 \div 3 = 14 \]

This means there are 14 segments of 3 miles in the 42-mile city.

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we multiply the number of segments by the time it takes to cover each segment:
\[ 14 \times 10 = 140 \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Poppy starts with 1000 pieces.
2. She places a quarter of them on the board. A quarter of 1000 is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
3. After Poppy places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
4. Then, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces. A third of 750 is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
5. After her mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]

So, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"If Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, and Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cookies.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the inner dimensions of one box. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick. So, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the volume of one box using the inner dimensions:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total inner volume:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let's say the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is \(x\). Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

Now, we can set up the equation for the total hours of TV watched:

\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Henry is making cookies for a baking competition. He wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. After baking, he realized he made 15 more cookies than he intended. He then dropped 5 cookies and ended up with 110 cookies.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say Henry baked \( x \) cookies last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. But he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After dropping 5 cookies, he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies.
5. We know he ended up with 110 cookies, so:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without any cashback. Since gas costs $3.00 per gallon, for 10 gallons:
   \[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

2. Next, calculate the cashback. The app company gives $0.20 cashback per gallon, so for 10 gallons:
   \[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

3. Finally, subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out how much you have to pay:
   \[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final cost of the gas after the cashback is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate. Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, we multiply the width by the length:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
So, Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups.

Next, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, we multiply the width by the length:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]
So, Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups that both Beatrice and Marcell ate:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]
So, together they ate 90 fruit roll-ups.

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are two of them):
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row:**
   - Julia takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - So, the total distance is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate of water intake:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - So, the rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - Total distance rowed is 80 feet.
   - Using the rate of water intake, the total water taken on is:
     \[
     \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if Brittany's phone can hold \( B \) photographs, then:
   \[
   1800 = 6B
   \]
3. Solving for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

4. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. If the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \( D \), then:
   \[
   300 = 50D

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Sasha originally spent on the lumber.

1. **2x4x10 boards:**
   - She bought 10 boards at $10 each.
   - Total cost = 10 * $10 = $100.

2. **4x4x10 boards:**
   - She bought 5 boards at $16 each.
   - Total cost = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, we need to find out how much she can sell the lumber for now that the prices have increased by 50%.

1. **2x4x10 boards:**
   - New price per board = $10 * 1.5 = $15.
   - Total selling price = 10 * $15 = $150.

2. **4x4x10 boards:**
   - New price per board = $16 * 1.5 = $24.
   - Total selling price = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, she uses 13 parts of water. The total parts used are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, we can find out how much each part represents by dividing 120 by 20:

\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 6 by 7 to find the amount of sugar used:

\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[ 42 \]"

1. **Adrien's Salary Four Years Ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

2. **Lylah's Salary Four Years Ago:**
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - If we let Lylah's salary be \( L \), then \( 40,000 = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

3. **Adrien's Current Salary:**
   - Adrien's salary increased by 40% from $40,000.
   - So, his current salary is \( 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

4. **Lylah's Current Salary:**
   - Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, her current salary is \( 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92 \).

5. **Total Salary Four Years Later:**
   - Adding Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries, we get \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

Therefore, the number of video games Bobby has is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know there are 27 unicorns in total.
2. One third of these unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we calculate one third of 27:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]
   This means there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
3. Two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female. So, we calculate two thirds of 9:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   This means there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is \(\boxed{6}\)."

2. **Cost of Chips**: Rory orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each.
   \[
   2 \times 1.50 = 3.00
   \]

3. **Cost of Cookies**: Rory orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each.
   \[
   2 \times 1.00 = 2.00
   \]

4. **Total Cost of Items**: Add the costs of the subs, chips, and cookies.
   \[
   15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00
   \]

5. **Delivery Fee**: There's a 20% delivery fee on the total cost of the items.

   \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\)."
"Mark took two tests. The first test had 75 questions, and he completed 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours to complete the first test. Let's calculate how many questions he completed:

\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

So, he left:

\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

unanswered in the first test.

For the second test, he had 100 questions and 6 hours to complete it. At the same rate of 5 questions per hour, he completed:

\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

So, he left:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

unanswered in the second test.

Adding the unanswered questions from both tests:

\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs.

First, let's write down the relationship given in the problem in a simple equation. If \( B \) is the number of blue gumballs and \( P \) is the number of pink gumballs, then:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Since we know \( B = 12 \), we can substitute 12 for \( B \) in the equation:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]

And then the addition:
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these:
- 12 are automatic cars
- 4 are manual cars

To find out how many are semi-automatic, we subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:
20%"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

We know there are 700 bees in total in the hive. Let's use some simple math to figure out how many worker bees there are.

1. Let's say the number of queen bees is \( Q \).
2. The number of baby bees is twice the number of queen bees, so it's \( 2Q \).
3. The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees, so it's \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \).

Now, we know the total number of bees is the sum of queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queen bees. Now we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ \text{Number of baby bees} = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ \text{Number of worker bees} = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

First, let's find out how many hours he plays video games in a week:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money he would earn if he worked those 14 hours:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

So, Jordan would earn \(\$140\) in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

The final answer is: \(\$140\)."
"John buys different items and there's a 10% tax on some of them. Here's the breakdown:

- Milk: $2 (food item)
- Eggs: $3 (food item)
- Light bulbs: $3 (non-food item)
- Cups: $3 (non-food item)
- Roach traps: $4 (non-food item)

First, we add up the cost of the non-food items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Calculate the total number of clients:**
   - Kim already has 3 clients.
   - He is talking to 5 potential clients.
   - So, the total number of clients will be \(3 + 5 = 8\).

2. **Calculate the cost for each client:**
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is \(2 \times \$2 = \$4\).
   - The cost of 1 pack of cloths is \$5.
   - So, the total cost for each client is \( \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for all clients:**
   - Since there are 8 clients, the total cost will be \(8 \times \$9 = \$72\).

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Kim's total income each week is \$92.
   - The total expenses are \$72.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.
2. There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
3. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.

First, calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \]

Since John has 10 hectares:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

John can harvest these pineapples every 3 months. In a year, there are 12 months, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Charlie has 12 friends. So, if we let the number of friends Dorothy has be \(D\), we can write:
\[3D = 12\]

To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we divide both sides by 3:
\[D = \frac{12}{3} = 4\]

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has by multiplying 4 by 4:
\[4 \times 4 = 16\]

Therefore, James has 16 friends.

Final answer:

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it takes for Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference in their times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve lives 3 miles away, which is \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet.
- Tim lives 2 miles away, which is \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, so the time it takes for him to get home is \(15840 \div 440 = 36\) minutes.
- Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes for him to get home is \(10560 \div 264 = 40\) minutes.

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came to inflate both tires, then the total number of bicycle tires inflated is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came to inflate all their tires, then the total number of tricycle tires inflated is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came to inflate their tire, then the total number of unicycle tires inflated is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Now, let's add up all the tires:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500\] cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[500 \div 100 = 5\] dollars.

So, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. A seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Now, let's work backwards:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let's say there were \( y \) fries. The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

First, we need to figure out how many hours Kimo spends in classes each week.

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour. So, for these 3 days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours. So, for these 2 days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total length of the rolls:**
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - So, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:**
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - So, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Calculate the total length of the baguettes:**
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - So, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

4. **Add up the total length in inches:**
   - Total length = length of rolls + length of croissants + length of baguettes
   - Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

5. **Convert the total length from inches to feet:**
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we divide the total length in inches by 12.
   - Total length in feet = \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monkeys' Requirement:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how far Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. So, each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards to the end and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

The final answer is \(\boxed{280}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

So, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Original Price**: The bag of marbles costs $20.
2. **Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% every two months.
3. **Time Period**: We need to find the price after 36 months.

First, let's figure out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

Next, we need to calculate the price after each 20% increase. The price after each period can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Periods}} \]

Here, the original price is $20, the increase rate is 20% (or 0.20), and the number of periods is 18. So, we have:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Now, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \). Using a calculator, we find:
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Finally, we multiply the original price by this value:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
   - So, the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = \$20\).

2. There are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = \$15\).

3. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = \$15\).

4. Now, we add up the total cost of all the toys:
   - Red cars: \$20
   - Action figures: \$15
   - Doll: \$15
   - Total: \(20 + 15 + 15 = \$50\)

So, the total worth of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."

If she hires an accountant, it will cost her $90.

By hiring the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income minus the $90 cost, which is \(105 - 90 = 15\) dollars.

So, Jackie will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars more if she hires the accountant."
"Elvira's budget is €1500. She bought a computer for €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Let's add up the costs:

- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

Now, let's do the math:

1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €102 = €1423

So, the total cost of the items is €1423. 

Elvira's budget is €1500, so the money left for her clothing is:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

Therefore, the money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €77."

- Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
- Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).

The problem states that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. If Ethel has $8, let's figure out how much money Jimmy has.

First, we calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The hat costs $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Spiders:**
   - There are 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - So, the total number of legs from spiders is \(80 \times 8 = 640\).

2. **Insects:**
   - There are 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - So, the total number of legs from insects is \(90 \times 6 = 540\).

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each has 10 legs.
   - So, the total number of legs from these invertebrates is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's age**: Since Sally Thirtytwo is the same age as Sally Four, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. So, Granny Red's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. So, Sally Two's age is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, let's add up the ages of all four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Adding these together:

\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total minimum payment Jessica has to make each month for all her debts. She has:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

So, the total minimum monthly payment is:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we need to find 50% of $1000 and add it to $1000.

50% of $1000 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total monthly payment Jessica will make is:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Jessica pays in a year is:
\[ \boxed{18000} \]"

**Faster Team:**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 runners, the total time is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they take:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so they take:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so they take:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]

Adding these times together gives the total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team takes 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team takes 212 seconds. The difference is:

"Sure, let's break this down step by step.

### Event 1: Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
When you roll a six-sided die, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

Now, we need to find out how much they need per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the weekly total by 7:

\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Starting Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net Increase per Year**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, so the net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Trees After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Adding this to the initial 50 trees, Tom has \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees after 10 years.
4. **Trees That Die**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

"Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. He edits an equal number of sentences for two different publishers, so he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers, Mark makes:
\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, the amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{7500} \]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - So, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese used:
\[14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 31\]

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\)."

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93:**
   - Since there are 6 tests, the total score needed is \(93 \times 6 = 558\).

2. **Sum the scores of the first five tests:**
   - The scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - Adding these together: \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).

3. **Determine the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the first five tests, we need to find the lowest score and subtract it from the total score needed.
   - The lowest score is 71.
   - So, the adjusted total score needed is \(558 - 71 = 487\).

4. **Find the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - The score needed on the sixth test is \(487 - 438 = 49\).

Therefore, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{191}\) on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first four weeks:
- He rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

So, the distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- He rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

So, the distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
2. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, so each candied apple weighs:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
   \]

3. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
   \[
   25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams}
   \]

4. Joe also has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
   \[
   80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams}
   \]

5. To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:
   \[
   1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams}
   \]

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[
\boxed{2600}

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Half a Dozen Plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - So, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Cost of Twenty Dozen Cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Cost per Cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Cost of Items:**
   - The jacket costs $30.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $20, and Sara wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

2. **Earnings from Babysitting:**
   - Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

3. **Money Sara Already Has:**
   - Sara already has $10 saved.

4. **Total Money Sara Will Have:**
   - If Sara mows the lawn \(x\) times, she earns $4 each time, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Sara will have is \(10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\) dollars.

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes.
   - So, we set up the inequality: \(30 + 4x \geq 70\).

6. **Solving the Inequality:**
   - Subtract 30 from both sides: \(4x \geq 40\).
   - Divide both sides by 4: \(x \geq 10\).

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say the number of red chickens is \( r \). Then the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be written as:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with a length of 6 miles and a width of 1.5 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:

\[ t = \frac{distance}{speed} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

The total number of customers by the third day was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

2. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool.
   - Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since it lost 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes).
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

3. **Using the Given Information:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[ B = 4S \]

4. **Solving the Equations:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
     \[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
     \[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
     \[ 2S = 16 \]
     \[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( \boxed{8} \) gallons."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Harriet is currently 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, let's find their ages in three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons are ready for harvest. This means the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons are ready for harvest at this point. This means the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21

"Dax went to the farm to pick apples and noticed there were half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, we need to find the total number of insects in the garden.

First, let's find the number of bugs:
\[
\text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we add the number of ants and bugs to get the total number of insects:
\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 36 penguins sunbathing. 

First, we need to find out how many penguins jump into the ocean. Since one-third of them do this, we calculate:
\[ \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, another one-third of the penguins go into the cave to eat their dinner. Again, we calculate:
\[ \frac{36}{3} = 12 \]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, to find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we subtract the number of penguins that left from the initial number:
\[ 36 - 12 - 12 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 3 cherry tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 cherry tomatoes per day. 

In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 cherry tomatoes.

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed is 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza are needed in total. John has 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend wants:
   \[
   20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas John should order. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

So, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **Using Pens to Make New Pens**: For every 5 empty pens, Ram can make 1 new pen. So, from 25 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]
3. **Total Pens After First Cycle**: After using the 25 pens to make 5 new pens, Ram now has:
   \[
   25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \text{ pens}
   \]
4. **Using Remaining Pens to Make More Pens**: Now, Ram has 5 pens. He can use these 5 pens to make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]
5. **Total Pens After Second Cycle**: After using the 5 pens to make 1 new pen, Ram now has:
   \[
   5 - 5 + 1 = 1 \text{ pen}
   \]
6. **Final Check**: With 1 pen left, he cannot make any more new pens since he needs 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:
\[
25 + 5 + 1 = 31
\]

**Final Answer**:
\[
\boxed{31}

1. **Total Students**: There are 1000 students in the school hall.

2. **Students who went out through Exit A**: 30% of 1000 students went out through Exit A.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through Exit A.

3. **Students remaining after Exit A**: Subtract the students who went out through Exit A from the total number of students.
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students are left.

4. **Students who went out through Exit B**: \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students went out through Exit B.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through Exit B.

5. **Students who went out through Exit C**: Subtract the students who went out through Exits A and B from the total number of students.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280

5. To find the total number of books read by both, we add the number of books Dolly reads to the number of books Pandora reads: \(3 + 3 = 6\).

So, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mike originally had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.

3. Mike also sends 6 letters a week in response.

4. Each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.

5. Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.

6. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60: \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

So, the time Mike spends writing a week is \(\boxed{3.6}\) hours."

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem states that this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. If we let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium, then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). According to the problem, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours each day.
3. So, the daily cost is $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.
4. She needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
5. So, the weekly cost is $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.
6. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
7. So, the total cost before the discount is $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.
8. She gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
9. The discount amount is 10% of $30000, which is 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, let's figure out how many cougars Rick killed today. Since he killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night, and he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]

Next, since he killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, and he killed 12 cougars today, he killed:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves} \]

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many cows are in all the stalls initially. There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows. So, the total number of cows is:
   \[
   10 \times 20 = 200
   \]

2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows added to each stall is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{20} = 2
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many cows are in each stall after adding the new cows. Initially, each stall has 20 cows, and 2 more cows are added to each stall, so each stall now has:
   \[

\]
\[
132 = 12x
\]
\[
x = \frac{132}{12} = 11
\]

So, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies.
2. Convert the number of pennies to dollars.

"To find out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat to 400 degrees.
   - So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Add up all the times: \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

So, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, let's add them up:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - So, for one house, the number of bedroom windows is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows.
   - So, for 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]
4. Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]
5. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800. So, the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette together are:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 270 = 1170
   \]
6. The remaining stitches are for the two sleeves. So, the total stitches for the sleeves are:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]
7. Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

So, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{315}\) stitches."

First, we need to find out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on the tomato seeds. She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:
\[ 20 \text{ packets} \times \$40/\text{packet} = \$800 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the celery seeds. She bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:
\[ 80 \text{ packets} \times \$30/\text{packet} = \$2400 \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200 \]

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[
\boxed{3200}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - So, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the song.
   - So, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines."

1. Carly started with 80 cards.
2. \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A on them:
   \[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]
   So, 32 cards had the letter A.

3. This leaves:
   \[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]
   cards remaining.

4. \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had the letter B on them:
   \[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]
   So, 24 cards had the letter B.

"To find out how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
- It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- For 30 small holes, the total time is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
- It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- For 15 large holes, the total time is \(15 \times 10 = 150\) minutes.

Now, we add the time for both the small and large holes:
- Total time = \(90 + 150 = 240\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- \(240\) minutes is equal to \(240 \div 60 = 4\) hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\) hours."

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Sam's current age is \( S \).
2. According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

In 9 years:
- Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \).
- Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \).

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Extra points in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. His total becomes \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not more than 20, so he does not get an extra point. His total remains 18 points.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. His total becomes \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

3. **Total points after the fourth round:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
2. There are 5 people in the household.
3. They eat rice at both lunch and dinner, so that's 2 meals a day.

First, calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg per meal} \]

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed per day is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last:

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles each week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John works 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles each year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles driven annually is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

So, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
\[
\boxed{31800}
\]"
"On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. To find out the total time he exercised on both days, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. So, we multiply the total by 2:

\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To figure out how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, let's think about it step by step.

1. **Understanding the Folding**: When you fold a piece of paper in half, you get two layers. Each layer can have two pages printed on it: one on the front and one on the back. So, one piece of paper can make 4 pages in total.

2. **Total Pages Needed**: We need 32 pages for the tabloid.

3. **Calculating the Pieces of Paper**: Since each piece of paper can make 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per piece of paper.
   \[
   \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
   \]

So, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $25. Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount she spent is $25 + $10 = $35. 

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

So, the amount of money left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Books and Unsold Books:**
   - Elise started with 250 books.
   - Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
   - So, the number of books sold so far is \(250 - 50 = 200\).

2. **Books Sold This Year:**
   - This year, Elise sold 45 books.

3. **Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - The problem states that the number of books sold in the first year is twice the number sold this year.
   - So, the number of books sold in the first year is \(2 \times 45 = 90\).

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - We know the total number of books sold is 200.
   - Subtract the books sold in the first and third years from the total.
   - So, the number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 90 - 45 = 65\).

5. **Money Earned in the Second Year:**
   - Each book is sold for $20.
   - Therefore, the money earned in the second year is \(65 \times 20 = 1300\).

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\)."
"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week. He earns $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

First, let's find out how much Watson earns in a day:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, let's find out how much he earns in a week without the bonus:
\[ \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April usually has 4 weeks. So, Watson's total earnings for April are:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Therefore, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

First, we need to find out how many people he beat. We do this by calculating 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. In the morning, two-thirds of the loaves are sold. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. This means that after the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - In 15 days, we need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days.
   - \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)
   - So, the person will grow 5 extra arms.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - In 15 days, we need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)
   - So, the person will grow 3 extra legs.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and legs.
   - Total new limbs = 5 (extra arms) + 3 (extra legs) = 8

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown a total of 8 new limbs.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Business Suits**: Theo buys 6 suits at $100 each.
   \[
   6 \times 100 = 600
   \]
   So, the total cost for suits is $600.

2. **Suitcases**: He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]
   So, the total cost for suitcases is $150.

3. **Flight Ticket**: The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a suit costs $100:
   \[
   5 \times 100 = 500
   \]
   Adding $700 to this:
   \[
   500 + 700 = 1200
   \]
   So, the flight ticket costs $1200.

4. **Total Spending**: Theo wants to save $2000, so he can spend:
   \[
   6000 - 2000 = 4000
   \]
   So, he can spend $4000 on the trip.

5. **Total Cost of Suits, Suitcases, and Flight Ticket**:
   \[
   600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
   \]
   So, the total cost for these items is $1950.

6. **Amount Left for Gifts**:
   \[
   4000 - 1950 = 1950
   \]
   So, Theo has $1950 left to spend on gifts.

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is \(\boxed{1950}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the family, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs these 3 people eat each day is:
   \[
   3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. The rest of the family (which is 2 people) eat 2 eggs each day. So, the total number of eggs these 2 people eat each day is:
   \[
   2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. The total number of eggs the whole family eats each day is:
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. Since they eat eggs every day, the total number of eggs the family eats in a week (7 days) is:
   \[
   13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
   \]

So, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we subtract 3 from Quinn's age:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

So, Trent is \(\boxed{32}\) years old."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step in a way that's easy to understand.

1. **Cera's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - So, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - So, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - So, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

Therefore, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's \( 2D \).
3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players is the sum of players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is 105. So we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's multiply every term by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, the total number of people invited is:

- For the 2 families with 6 people: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- For the 3 families with 4 people: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 8 people had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
2. He already had 50 marbles in the store.
3. His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of marbles Solomon has:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kgs/marble} = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool**: The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Plugging in the dimensions:
   \[
   V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool**: The cost to fill the pool is the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can figure out the number of girls and nongendered children based on the information provided.

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and there are 45 electric wires needed, we can find the number of electric poles required.

The ratio 1:3 means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. So, if there are 45 wires, we can set up the following:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of poles}}{\text{Number of wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Since the number of wires is 45, we can substitute 45 for the number of wires:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of poles}}{45} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To find the number of poles, we solve for the number of poles:

\[
\text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

So, the total number of electric poles required is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"At the start, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the people left, which is 10 people. So, 30 people stayed. If 22 men stayed, then the number of women who stayed is \(30 - 22 = 8\).

The number of women left at the party is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"The book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The cost of the pen is $1."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jam has 26 pencils in total. Out of these, 2 pencils are loose, and the rest are in 3 boxes. So, the number of pencils in the boxes is:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are in 3 boxes, each box contains:
\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Now, we know that Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils they have together, we add their pencils:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Shannon makes iced coffee by adding ice cubes and cream to her hot coffee. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. Shannon wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and adds 15 milliliters of cream. We need to find out how much the coffee is weakened in total.

First, let's find out how many ice cubes Shannon needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
\[
\frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

Next, we calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:
\[
5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Now, we add the weakening effect of the cream:
\[
60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is weakened by \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

Ralph's store allows people to trade 2 old records for 1 new record. We know that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records.

For each new record, 2 old records are traded. So, if they got 7 new records, we need to find out how many old records were traded for those 7 new records.

\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Employees**: The company has 100 employees.
2. **Junior Programmers**: The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]
3. **Senior Programmers**: The number of senior programmers is the total employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]
4. **Payment to Junior Programmers**: Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]
5. **Payment to Senior Programmers**: Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so they are paid $2400 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]
6. **Total Payment**: The total amount the company pays to all programmers is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus now is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \), which simplifies to \( x + 6 \).
4. We know that at the third bus stop, there were 20 people on the bus. So, we can write the equation \( x + 6 = 20 \).
5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
   Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 14

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left. He then passes 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) lollipops. Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops. That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops. In the morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, so he has \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops left.

The final number of lollipops Oscar has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"The phone needs to go from 60% charged to 100%, which means it needs an additional 40 percentage points of charge.

The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, to find out how long it will take to recharge the remaining 40 percentage points, we can multiply:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert 120 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the Rewards Earned:**
   - The customer spent $80 last time.
   - For every $20 spent, they get $1 off the next purchase.
   - So, the number of $20 increments in $80 is \( \frac{80}{20} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, they earned $4 in rewards.

2. **Apply the Rewards and Coupon:**
   - This time, they spent $43.
   - They used the $4 reward, so the price after the reward is \( 43 - 4 = 39 \) dollars.
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of the reward off the price, so it takes \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars off.
   - Therefore, the final amount they paid is \( 39 - 8 = 31 \) dollars.

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

For Job A:
- Nick earns $15 per hour and works 2000 hours a year.
- So, his annual pay is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
- The state tax is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000.
- After tax, Nick gets $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B:
- Nick earns $42,000 a year.
- There's a property tax of $6,000.
- After property tax, he has $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
- The state tax is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600.
- After all taxes, Nick gets $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's see the difference:
- Job B pays $32,400.
- Job A pays $24,000.
- The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

The final answer is: $8,400."

So, the cost difference between the two offers is $100."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of paintball guns they have. DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ (which I think is a typo and should be Richard) has 5 guns, and Richard has 5 guns. So, we add these numbers together:

\[ 8 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 28 \]

Now, we need to share these 28 guns equally among the 4 of them. To do this, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:

\[ \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 7 guns.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{7}\)"
"Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers and 70 ounces for each batch of fudge. To find out how much sugar he needs for 8 batches of suckers, we multiply 30 by 8:

\[ 30 \times 8 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

For 1 batch of fudge, he needs 70 ounces. So, the total amount of sugar needed is the sum of the sugar for the suckers and the fudge:

\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   - Total cost = 8 shares * $8/share = $64

2. After the first year, the stock price increases by 50%.
   - Increase in price = 50% of $8 = 0.50 * $8 = $4
   - New price per share = $8 + $4 = $12

3. After the second year, the stock price decreases by 25%.
   - Decrease in price = 25% of $12 = 0.25 * $12 = $3
   - New price per share = $12 - $3 = $9

4. Now, let's find the total value of Maria's shares.
   - Total value = 8 shares * $9/share = $72

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, so Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs. John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(\frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3\) hot dogs. To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We have a class of 200 students split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two larger groups has \( x \) students. Then the smallest group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, which are either chickens or cows. We know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's use some simple math to figure this out.

1. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \).
2. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is \( 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, so we have:
   \[
   C + 2C = 60
   \]
4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   3C = 60
   \]
5. Solving for \( C \), we divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   C = 20
   \]
6. So, the number of cows is 20. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, the number of chickens is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[
4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160
\]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
5. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all the animals and the container:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag:
\[ 36 - (20 + 7) = 36 - 27 = 9 \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

The final answer is 9."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, find the discount on one shirt:
   - The original price of one shirt is $30.
   - The discount is 40%, so we calculate 40% of $30:
     \[
     30 \times \frac{40}{100} = 30 \times 0.40 = 12
     \]
   - So, the discount on one shirt is $12.

2. Next, find the price of one shirt after the discount:
   - Subtract the discount from the original price:
     \[
     30 - 12 = 18

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
2. It then travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
3. The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs. So, the distance is \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the total distance for one trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:

   - 2 seniors will get pins that cost $5 each.
   - So, the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so 1/4 of 44 is 11.
   - Each officer gets a cord that costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding all the costs together: $1056 (picture frames) + $10 (pins) + $132 (cords) = $1198.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is \(\boxed{1198}\)."
"If Ethan makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, he saves 20% on the original cost of $400.

First, let's find out how much he saves:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80 \]

So, he saves $80. Now, we subtract the savings from the original price to find the total cost:
\[ 400 - 80 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total cost if Ethan makes his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: They sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: They sold half the amount sold on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. But 6 pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's add up the total number of pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

The total number of pairs sold is \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is \(50 \times 2 = 100\).

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \(\boxed{100}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. First, we need to find out how much interest she will have to pay.

The interest rate for five months is:
\[ \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the interest on the principal amount:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is:
\[ 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:
\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares.

Let's say the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is \( x \) hectares. So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

"Sure, let's break this down step by step.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we need to find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in a day when it's on for 8 hours. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. So for 8 hours, it uses:
   \[
   900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts}
   \]
   Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is 1000 watts, we convert 7200 watts to kilowatts:
   \[
   7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts}
   \]

2. Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he will use it for:
   \[
   8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   So, the energy used in 3 hours is:
   \[
   900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts}
   \]
   Converting to kilowatts:
   \[
   2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts}
   \]

3. The daily savings in energy consumption is the difference between the two amounts:
   \[
   7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts}
   \]

4. To find out how much energy is saved over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
   \[
   4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts}
   \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]"

5. **Calculate the total cost of meat and cheese:**
   - The total cost is \( 35 + 15 = 50 \) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Corns:**
   - We know Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - He has twice as much corn as cannolis.
   - So, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **New Number of Cannolis:**
   - Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   - The new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Number of Corns:**
   - He bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.
   - He bought 60 cannolis, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
   - The new total number of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.
   - The new total number of corns is 60.
   - The combined total is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take.

First, let's find out how many steps he had taken before his jog:
- Steps from walking to and from school: 5,000
- Steps from the short walk with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he had taken before his jog plus the steps during his jog should equal 10,000:
- Steps taken before the jog: 6,000
- Steps left to take: 2,000
- Total steps: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000

So, the steps he took during his jog are:
- Total steps before the jog: 6,000
- Total steps after the jog: 8,000
- Steps during the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. The book averages 200 words per page, so the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, so the time it takes him to read the book is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After finishing the book, it takes him 10 more minutes to get to the airport, so the total time from the start of reading until he leaves for the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, the number of minutes early he will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - In May, the company hired 40 employees.
   - Each employee is paid $15 per hour.
   - Each employee works 40 hours a week.
   - So, the payment for one employee in May is \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars.
   - For 40 employees, the total payment is \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
   - So, the number of employees who left is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).
   - The number of employees remaining is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - In June, there are 30 employees.
   - Each employee is still paid $15 per hour.
   - Each employee works 40 hours a week.
   - So, the payment for one employee in June is \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars.
   - For 30 employees, the total payment is \( 600 \times 30 = 18000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total payment for both months:**
   - The total payment for May is 24000 dollars.
   - The total payment for June is 18000 dollars.
   - So, the total payment for both months is \( 24000 + 18000 = 42000 \) dollars.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is **42000** dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Taffy Cost:**
   - The taffy is on sale: ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
   - So, for 2 pounds, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off of $3 is $1.50).
   - Total cost for taffy: \(3 + 1.50 = 4.50\)

2. **Seashells Cost:**
   - The seashells cost $1.50.

3. **Magnets Cost:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets.
   - Total cost for magnets: \(4 \times 0.25 = 1.00\)

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for taffy, seashells, and magnets: \(4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00\)

5. **Money Left:**
   - Sally started with $10.
   - After spending $7.00, the money left is: \(10 - 7 = 3\)

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Tim buys two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, which is $800. So, the total cost of the two packages before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200. He gets a 20% discount on these two packages, so the discount amount is $1200 \times 0.20 = $240. Therefore, the cost after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960. He also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted fireworks, the total amount Tim spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies every night. To find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days, we multiply the number of cookies she eats per night by the number of nights in 30 days:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many of the 50,000 candles both smell like wet dog and will explode.

First, let's figure out how many candles will explode. The problem states that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles will explode.

1. Calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 candles also smell like wet dog. The problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles (which we can assume are the ones that might explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. Calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the sale price of one blouse. The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale for 30% off. This means the sale price is 70% of the original price.
   
   \[
   \text{Sale price of one blouse} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half of that from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's say Joanne gathers \(x\) apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, for her sister:
1. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. She gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. She doesn't gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples her sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

Together, they have gathered a total of 500 apples. So, we can write the equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne gathered \(\boxed{350}\) apples from the average trees."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know:
- Camels and dromedaries together have 180 heads.
- Camels and dromedaries together have 304 humps.

Since each animal has one head, the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries equals 180:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so the total number of humps is:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To find the number of camels (\( c \)), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, we know there are 124 camels. To find the number of dromedaries (\( d \)), we substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
Subtract 124 from both sides:
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the trip step by step:

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for 4 days: \(200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}\).

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   - Distance for 2 days: \(800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}\).

3. **Next Day:**
   - He didn't travel at all, so the distance is \(0 \text{ km}\).

4. **Second Week:**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week: \(300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}\).

Now, let's add up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, to find Zack's locker size, we multiply Peter's size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, to find Timothy's locker size, we multiply Zack's size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell 4,000 feet from his starting point of 10,000 feet, so it landed at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

The answer is 3,000 feet."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\) dollars.
3. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and each boat carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50 cats, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 cats that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the cost step by step:

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Tattered Jeans**: The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. **Cost of Jogger Jeans**: The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
   \[
   28 - 6 = 22
   \]

3. **Total Savings**: Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of this from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
4. **Savings from Jogger Jeans**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
   \]
5. **Savings from Tattered Jeans**: 
   \[
   6 - 2 = 4
   \]

6. **Original Price of Jogger Jeans**: Let's say the original price of the jogger jeans is \( x \). The sale price is $22, so the savings from the jogger jeans is:
   \[
   x - 22 = 2
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 22 + 2 = 24
   \]

7. **Difference in Original Prices**: The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans is $24. The difference is:
   \[
   28 - 24 = 4
   \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The final answer is:

"Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 more. Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, and each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one, so each homemade feeder attracts 30 birds.

For the store-bought feeders:
\[3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds/feeder} = 60 \text{ birds}\]

For the homemade feeders:
\[3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds/feeder} = 90 \text{ birds}\]

Adding these together:
\[60 \text{ birds} + 90 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds}\]

So, Lillian can expect to see \(\boxed{150}\) birds in her garden each day."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

   \]
   So, the soup costs:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake Cost**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. So, the cake costs:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2

So, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He plans to sell the cards for $1.5 each and ends up with $50 in spending cash after buying the ticket. 

First, let's find out how much money Kenny has in total:
- Ticket cost: $100
- Spending cash: $50
- Total money: $100 + $50 = $150

Next, we need to figure out how many cards he sold:
- Each card is sold for $1.5
- Number of cards sold = Total money / Price per card = $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest. Let's say he started with \( x \) cards. He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them:
- 2/3 of \( x \) = 100 cards

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \]
\[ x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} \]
\[ x = 150 \]

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer: 150**"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Plan:**
   - The caterer was supposed to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18 guests) were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each.
   - So, \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The other half (18 guests) were supposed to have 1 hotdog each.
   - So, \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \(36 + 18 = 54\).

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - The first 18 guests each got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \(22 \times 1 = 22\) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \(36 + 22 = 58\).

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \(58 - 54 = 4\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. First, we find half of Indras' name:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we add 4 to this number to find the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name together:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. Each utensil costs $5.00, and there are 5 utensils, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we need to apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means we pay 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"First, let's find out the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

So, the total cost is $19.

Next, let's see how much money Dora has:
- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Adding these amounts:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora has $18.

Now, to find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the money she has from the total cost:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. So, we calculate:
   \[

   \]
   Prince Arthur slew 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
   Prince Walter slew 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate:

   \]
   Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much gasoline is in each container. We have 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers:
   \[
   \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
   \]

2. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is:
\[
6 \text{ pints}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He had 1% of his money left, which is $0.05.
3. So, he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Next, let's figure out how much he spent on chips:
1. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
2. So, the cost of the chips is 3 × $0.40 = $1.20.

Now, let's find out how much he spent on candy bars:
1. He spent $4.95 in total and $1.20 on chips.
2. So, the amount spent on candy bars is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Finally, let's calculate how many candy bars he bought:
1. Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
2. So, the number of candy bars he bought is $3.75 ÷ $0.75 = 5.

Therefore, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so he shared the rest with his friends. The number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

Therefore, each friend received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces and cut it into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each had one piece, so 2 pieces were eaten. Each piece weighs \( \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \) ounces. Therefore, the 2 pieces they ate weigh \( 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \) ounces. The remaining cake weighs \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) ounces.

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Antoine's French onion soup recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. He likes to double that amount, so he will use 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so the onions will cost him:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 a box. So the beef stock will cost him:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock together, the total cost is:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's, so:
   \[ 4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
4. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes, Bernadette needs to account for the extra time in her drive:
   \[ 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]
5. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 12 minutes earlier.

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

We know the area of the room is 360 square feet. The area of a rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
So, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can find the perimeter of the room. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."

First, we need to find out how long it took Jon to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, Jon's total time is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to find out how long James took for the run. We know the total time for James is the sum of the time for the swim, the bike ride, and the run:
\[ 36 + 85 + \text{run time} = 180 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one helium balloon on the initial day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so we divide $900 by 20:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, each balloon costs $45 on the initial day.

Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by 170:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he starts with 100 pairs.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. So, he now has \(100 + 5 = 105\) pairs, which is \(105 \times 2 = 210\) shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes. So, he now has \(105 + 15 = 120\) pairs, which is \(120 \times 2 = 240\) shoes.
4. On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs of shoes. So, he now has \(120 + 30 = 150\) pairs, which is \(150 \times 2 = 300\) shoes.
5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. So, he now has \(300 - 180 = 120\) shoes.

Therefore, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is \(\boxed{120}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. We want to find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat to have a total of 5 cookies.

Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks. According to the problem, the number of cookies he can have is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to have 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 6 inches to feet:
   \[
   6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} = 0.5 \text{ feet}
   \]
   So, the total length of the 2 remoras is:
   \[
   2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find out what percentage the remoras' length is of the shark's body length, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10\%}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

We know there are 32 kids in Gina's class. Some of these kids have allergies:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

To find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of these substances, we use a simple formula:
\[ \text{Total allergic} = \text{Dairy allergic} + \text{Peanut allergic} - \text{Both allergic} \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Total allergic} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. To find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of allergic kids from the total number of kids:
\[ \text{Not allergic} = \text{Total kids} - \text{Total allergic} \]
\[ \text{Not allergic} = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

1. **Plane Tickets**: The cost of each plane ticket is $5000. Since Tom and his wife are two people, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
   \[
   5000 \times 2 = 10000
   \]

2. **Hotel Cost**: The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. First, we calculate 20% of $1500:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.20 = 300
   \]
   So, the increased price per day is:
   \[
   1500 + 300 = 1800
   \]
   Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
   \[
   1800 \times 3 = 5400
   \]

3. **Total Cost**: Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

\[200 = 20x\]

Then, we divide both sides by 20:
\[x = \frac{200}{20} = 10\]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

If she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, the savings would be:
\[ 22 - 20 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals:
- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

**Final Answer:**
120"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we divide the number of onions Rose bought by 4:
\[ \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]
So, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Next, to find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we divide the number of potatoes Rose bought by 4:
\[ \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]
So, Sophia bought 1 potato.

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to get the total:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To help Andy reach his goal, we need to figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day.

1. **Total Calories to Burn:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
   - For each pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories.
   - So, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
     \[
     30 \times 3500 = 105000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Number of Days:**
   - Andy's goal is to lose the weight by July 19th.
   - Today is December 31st.
   - Counting the days from December 31st to July 19th:
     - December: 31 days
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July 1st to July 19th: 19 days
   - Total days = 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190 days

3. **Daily Calorie Deficit:**
   - To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, divide the total calories by the number of days:
     \[
     \frac{105000}{190} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
     \]

So, Andy needs to burn about 553 calories each day to reach his goal."
"Gerald works at a daycare and earns $30 every day. He worked for a whole week, which is 7 days. So, his total earnings for the week are \(30 \times 7 = 210\) dollars.

So, the answer is 110."
"Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. If she runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, we first find the total distance she runs:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of water she needs to drink for 2 km:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah will need to drink \(\boxed{120}\) milliliters of water."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Julie starts with $500.
2. She spends 20% of $500 on clothes. 
   - 20% of $500 is \(0.20 \times 500 = 100\).
   - So, she spends $100 on clothes.
3. After buying clothes, she has \(500 - 100 = 400\) dollars left.
4. She then spends 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs.
   - 25% of $400 is \(0.25 \times 400 = 100\).
   - So, she spends $100 on CDs.
5. After buying CDs, she has \(400 - 100 = 300\) dollars left.

So, the amount of money Julie has left is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the house and the lot together cost $120,000. We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \). Then the cost of the house would be \( 3L \).

The total cost is the sum of the cost of the house and the lot, so we can write the equation:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

So, the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3:
\[ 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of \(8 \times 5 = 40\) canvas bags. Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for the bags is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) dollars.

She then sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue from selling the bags is \(40 \times 8 = 320\) dollars.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[320 - 32 = 288\]

So, the profit Tara earned on her bags is \(\boxed{288}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many minutes the fight lasts. The fight has 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. So, we multiply the number of rounds by the minutes per round:
   \[
   5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Next, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find out how many punches he throws in 15 minutes, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of punches per minute:
   \[
   25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches}
   \]

So, the total number of punches Joe throws is:
\[
\boxed{375}

1. Suzanne made 36 cookies.
2. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]
3. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Therefore, Kelsie made \(\boxed{18}\) cookies."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Ali has in total. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, we calculate:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, Ali has $160 in total.

Next, Ali gives half of this amount to his sister. Half of $160 is:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount is:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Now, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. So, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to know how long Rob takes to shingle a house. The problem states that Rob takes 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

2. Next, we need to find out how long Royce takes. The problem says Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first find double Rob's time: \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes.

3. Then, we add 40 minutes to this double time to find out how long Royce takes: \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks 1 quart less than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks 2 quarts less than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts each person picks per hour:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

So, the total number of quarts picked per hour is:
\[6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning.
3. They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.
4. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

First, we need to find out how many loaves were left after selling some in the morning:
\[ 200 - 93 = 107 \]

Next, we subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon from the remaining loaves:
\[ 107 - 39 = 68 \]

Finally, we add the 6 unsold loaves returned by the grocery store:
\[ 68 + 6 = 74 \]

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is:

\[ \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

To find the total number of rows, we add the rows for the red tulips and the blue tulips:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Heather has a big bag of 27 cups of raisins. She wants to use these raisins to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. She decides to divide the raisins equally among these three uses.

First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins she will use for each purpose:
\[
\frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make with 9 cups of raisins. Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) cup of raisins. So, we divide 9 cups by \(\frac{3}{4}\) cup per batch:

Therefore, Heather can make \(\boxed{12}\) batches of oatmeal cookies."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much electricity Ada uses in a day before adding the new device. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and assuming she uses electricity for 24 hours a day, her daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh} \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption before adding the new device:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2016 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly electric bill before adding the new device is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3024 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, we need to find out how much electricity the new device will use in a day. The new device consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, so its daily consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{kWh} \]

Adding this to her original daily consumption, her new daily consumption is:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh} + 48 \, \text{kWh} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \]

Now, let's calculate her weekly consumption after adding the new device:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2352 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost of her new weekly electric bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3528 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ 3528 \, \text{\$} - 3024 \, \text{\$} = 504 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to figure out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them twice as long to paint a whole house. So, it would take 10 days for one person to paint a whole house.

2. Now, if 5 people are working together, they can paint faster. Since one person takes 10 days, 5 people working together would take less time. Specifically, since 5 people are working, they can paint the house in \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) days.

3. Finally, we need to convert the 2 days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, 2 days would be \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer chairs than sofas, so she has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs.
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs.
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas.

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
- Total sofas: \(20 + 64 = 84\)
- Total chairs: \(22 + 66 = 88\)

So, the total number of sofas and chairs is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. He paid a total of $48. To find out how much the headphone set cost, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:

\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set cost $44. If Tom decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have $44 more to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many more CDs he could buy by dividing the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:

\[ \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for some weeks. He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks and for 6 hours for 1 week.

First, we need to find out how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since there are 8 weeks in total and he worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the total hours for the 2 weeks he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the 1 week he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add all these together to get the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

1. **Find Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - So, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Find Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. **Find Jame's Cousin's Current Age:**
   - If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Calculate the Age Difference:**

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, and the computer cost $1,100.

First, let's find out how much the printer cost:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost and the individual costs of the computer and the printer. We can find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[31 + 50 = 81\]

Next, add 45 to 81:
\[81 + 45 = 126\]

Finally, add 62 to 126:
\[126 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

First, let's add the vlogs she made in the first three weeks:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Now, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

So, Emma needs to make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to reach her goal."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The original bill is $50.
2. You want to add a 20% tip to the bill. To find 20% of $50, you can calculate it as follows:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]
3. So, the total bill including the tip is:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60
   \]
4. Since you and your wife want to split the bill evenly, each person pays half of the total bill:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so it can be split into two halves, each with 15 days.

1. Let's say Elvis saves $x each day in the first half of April.
2. In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so he saves $2x each day.

Now, let's calculate the total savings for each half:
- For the first half: \(15 \times x = 15x\)
- For the second half: \(15 \times 2x = 30x\)

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[15x + 30x = 45x\]

We know that Elvis's total savings goal is $1125, so:
\[45x = 1125\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 45:
\[x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25\]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half. Since he saves twice as much in the second half:
\[2x = 2 \times 25 = 50\]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Verna spent on each type of fruit:
- Apples: 3 apples at $1.50 each, so \(3 \times 1.50 = 4.50\)
- Oranges: 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so \(5 \times 0.80 = 4.00\)
- Peaches: 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so \(6 \times 0.75 = 4.50\)

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\[4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00\]

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
\[20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\]

So, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he completed 20 tasks. So, we calculate Jairus's total earnings as follows:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]
So, Jairus gets $16.

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also completed 20 tasks. So, we calculate Jenny's total earnings as follows:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]
So, Jenny gets $10.

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]

So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars.
2. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.
3. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
   \[ B + 4B = 100 \]
4. Combining like terms, we get:
   \[ 5B = 100 \]
5. To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
   \[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]
6. So, Brad gets 20 dollars.
7. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate:
   \[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week."
"Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written.

1. Writing the alphabet in full twice:
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. Writing half of the alphabet once:
   - Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing half of it once: 13 letters.

3. Re-writing everything she has already written:
   - The total number of letters written so far is \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything: 65 letters.

4. Calculating the total number of letters written:
   - Total letters = \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is \(\boxed{81}\)."
"Mark was unwell for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, we need to find out how much he weighed at the start.

First, calculate the total weight he lost:
- He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months.
- So, total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds.

Next, find his initial weight:
- His final weight is 70 pounds.
- Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many toys Jonathan's play set should have. Since it needs to be five times larger than James's play set, and James has 80 toys, we calculate:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let's say Jonathan currently has \( x \) toys. Then, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

3. To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2 = 398

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Daniel will spend on each type of item:

- Notebooks: 5 notebooks at $1.50 each
  \[
  5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
  \]
- Pens: 2 pens at $0.25 each
  \[
  2 \times 0.25 = 0.50
  \]
- Calculator: 1 calculator at $12 each
  \[
  1 \times 12 = 12.00
  \]
- Geometry set: 1 geometry set at $10 each
  \[
  1 \times 10 = 10.00
  \]

Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:
\[
7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. So, we need to find 10% of $30.00:
\[
30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
\]

So, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hamburgers**: Carly orders 5 hamburgers at $4 each.
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much commission Antonella gets for the first $1000 in sales. She gets 30% of $1000:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]
   So, she earns $300 for the first $1000.

2. Next, we need to find out how much she earns for the sales over $1000. She sold $2500 in total, so the amount over $1000 is:
   \[
   2500 - 1000 = 1500
   \]
   For this $1500, she gets an additional 10% commission:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150
   \]
   So, she earns $150 for the sales over $1000.

3. Finally, we add the two amounts together to find her total earnings:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

So, the amount of money Antonella earned is $450."
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he already has is:

\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

He has 70 guests and wants to give each guest 2 bottles of water. So, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the bottles he already has from the total needed:

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles available} = 92 \text{ additional bottles needed} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles of water.

The final answer is: 92"
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water.

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:
- Twice the time it takes in cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to that: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to swim 3 miles:
- In cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is:
\[102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes}\]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."

2. Divide the total by the number of days (which is 7).

Let's start by adding up the birds:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{280}{7} = 40
\]

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.

The final answer is 40."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Diane starts with a number, which is 20.
2. She adds half of this number to itself: \(20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30\).
3. She then divides this result by 5: \(\frac{30}{5} = 6\).
4. Finally, she multiplies this result by the original number minus 12: \(6 \times (20 - 12) = 6 \times 8 = 48\).

So, the final value of the number train is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards. Together, they have \(5 + 2 = 7\) cards.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, we calculate the percentage error. The percentage error is the difference divided by the set temperature, multiplied by 100:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. Now, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to if the recipe calls for 520 degrees. Since the oven is 4% too hot, we need to find a temperature \( T \) such that when we increase it by 4%, we get 520 degrees. In other words:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

To find \( T \), we divide 520 by 1.04:

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, we can convert the first movie's duration to minutes:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the total time for both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much less Juan's house is worth compared to Herb's. Herb's house is worth $76,000, and Juan's house is 30% less expensive.

2. To find 30% of $76,000, we multiply $76,000 by 0.30:
   \[ 76000 \times 0.30 = 22800 \]

3. Now, we subtract this amount from $76,000 to find the value of Juan's house:
   \[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

4. Finally, we add the value of both houses together to find the total value:
   \[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought 12 cups and twice as many dishes, which means she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of cups and dishes:

- Total cups: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

The total number of utensils brought by both is \(52 + 68 = 120\).

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Pete buys contacts in boxes, and each box contains 90 contacts. He uses these contacts for 45 days. Each box costs $100.00, but there's a 10% discount. If he buys 2 boxes, we need to find out how much each contact will cost.

First, let's find the cost of one box after the discount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one box after discount} = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per contact is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

First, we need to figure out how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
So, Jill worked a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours on Sunday
So, John worked a total of \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours.

Next, we calculate how much each person earned. They are paid $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings:
\[3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30\]

John's earnings:
\[7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70\]

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Difference in earnings:
\[\$70 - \$30 = \$40\]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

The final answer is:
\(\boxed{40}\)"
"First, let's find out how many calories Hannah burns in total.

- Aerobics: 2 hours \(\times\) 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour \(\times\) 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Total calories burned: 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Now, we need to find out how much water she should drink. For every 200 calories burned, she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

So, for 1600 calories, the amount of water needed is:
\[
\frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue jelly beans.
   - The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so it is \( 0.99B \).
   - The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so it is \( 1.01B \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of jelly beans is 4500.
   - So, we can write the equation: \( 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \).

3. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \).
   - Therefore, \( 3B = 4500 \).
   - Solving for \( B \): \( B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \).

4. **Find the Number of Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   - Number of red jelly beans: \( 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \).
   - Number of green jelly beans: \( 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \).

5. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is \( 1515 - 1485 = 30 \).

So, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"Jared starts with a typing speed of 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by 5 more WPM, his new speed will be \(52 + 5 = 57\) WPM.

To find the average of his three speeds, we add them together and then divide by 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we add the speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by 3:

\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52

"If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds per week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds per week. 

To find out the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate the total weight change for each option over 5 weeks.

For Cheerios:
- Weekly weight loss: 1.25 pounds
- Total weight loss over 5 weeks: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

For Donuts:
- Weekly weight gain: 1.75 pounds
- Total weight gain over 5 weeks: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, to find the difference in weight:
- Difference: 8.75 pounds (gain from donuts) - 6.25 pounds (loss from Cheerios) = 15 pounds

So, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast is 15 pounds."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - So, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.
   - Total = \(100 + 200 + 16 = 316\).

So, Alex will need \(\boxed{316}\) seats."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first dog is an Affenpinscher, and it weighs 10 pounds.
2. The next dog is a Dachshund, which weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. So, the Dachshund weighs:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

First, we'll look at the costs on Amazon:
- The boots cost $16.
- The shipping costs $4.
- So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, we'll look at the costs on eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- The shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so it's $4 * 2 = $8.
- So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon:
- The difference in cost is $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.

The final answer is: $1."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
2. John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how much protein he gets from 200 grams, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = \frac{x \text{ grams of protein}}{200 \text{ grams of mushrooms}}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{3 \times 200}{100} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
   \]
3. Now, to find out how much protein John gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
   \[
   6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
   \]

So, the answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Jerry's current age is \( J \).
2. Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( J - 5 \).
3. According to the problem, Jerry's current age is twice what his age was 5 years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]
4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[ J = 2J - 10 \]
5. To isolate \( J \), we subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
   \[ J - 2J = -10 \]
   \[ -J = -10 \]
6. Multiply both sides by -1 to get:
   \[ J = 10 \]
7. So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.
8. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

So, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles as:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:
\[2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\]
\[3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\]

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."

"To find out how much each pump of shampoo costs, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Cost and Washings**: The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Washings per Pump**: Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
   \[
   \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
   \]

3. **Cost per Washing**: The total cost of the bottle is $24.00 for 120 washings:
   \[
   \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
   \]

4. **Cost per Pump**: Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
   \]

5. **Convert to Cents**: Since 1 dollar is 100 cents:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}

"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out costs $25, and the shorts he picks out cost $35. 

First, let's calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there is no discount mentioned, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe only has $50, so he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will not be able to make the purchase.

The amount of money Joe will have left is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day.
2. He plans to do this for 7 days.
3. So, the total number of dozens of croissants he will make in a week is:
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}
   \]
4. It takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
5. Therefore, the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissants is:
   \[
   28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter to repave.
- So, the total cost for Monica's street is \(150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$29,100\).

Next, let's calculate the cost for Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- It also costs $194 per meter to repave.
- So, the total cost for Lewis' street is \(490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} = \$95,060\).

Now, we find the difference in cost:
- The difference is \( \$95,060 - \$29,100 = \$65,960 \).

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{65960}\)"
"John is working on a program to identify cancer cells. He gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. After that, the project takes 10 times longer, which means it takes 45 months in total. The first 5 months cost $100,000 each, and the remaining 5 months cost 50% more, which is $150,000 each.

Let's calculate the total cost:

1. Cost for the first 5 months: \(5 \times 100,000 = 500,000\)
2. Cost for the remaining 5 months: \(5 \times 150,000 = 750,000\)

Adding these together gives the total cost:

1. First, we need to find the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats is:
   \[
   4 \times 18 = 72
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
   \]

3. Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the number of remaining seats:
   \[
   72 - 18 = 54
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day is 8 hours long, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:

First, we need to find out how many cars the tow truck pulled each day for the first three days. The problem states that the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, we calculate:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many cars the tow truck pulled each day for the remaining four days. The problem says that the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days. So, we calculate the number of cars pulled each day for these days:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
Then, we calculate the total number of cars pulled in the remaining four days:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Finally, we add the number of cars pulled in the first three days and the remaining four days to get the total number of cars pulled in the week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:

   \[
   40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. The required height to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. We need to find the difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}

1. The price of a diamond jewel is given as $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]
4. Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels to find the total price:

"Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents told him that if the cost per class is more than $10, they won't sign him up again. There are 10 total classes.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to figure out the maximum number of classes he can attend so that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

First, let's calculate the cost per class if he attends all 10 classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]
Since $6 is less than $10, he can attend all 10 classes.

Now, let's see how many classes he can miss. If he misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class then becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]
We need this to be less than or equal to $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]
To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]
Divide both sides by -10 (and remember to reverse the inequality):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"First, let's figure out Tim's new monthly salary after the 5% raise. His original salary is $20,000 a month. A 5% raise means he gets an extra 5% of $20,000.

\[ 5\% \text{ of } \$20000 = 0.05 \times \$20000 = \$1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:

\[ \$20000 + \$1000 = \$21000 \]

Next, he gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of his new monthly salary is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \$21000 = \$10500 \]

Adding this bonus to his new monthly salary gives:

\[ \$21000 + \$10500 = \$31500 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary with the bonus by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \$31500 \times 12 = \$378000 \]

So, Tim will make \(\$378000\) in a year."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of Suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Dress Pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - Each dress pant costs \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of one dress pant = \( \frac{750}{5} = 150 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for dress pants = \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
   - He has 10 suits, so he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of the costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.
   - Total cost = \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

So, the total cost of everything is \(\boxed{10800}\) dollars."

1. The first website publishes 20 political and weather news articles every day.
2. The second website publishes 10 business news articles every day.
3. February has 28 days.

First, we calculate the total number of articles published by the first website in February:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles published by the second website in February:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add the two totals together to find the combined total number of articles published by both websites in February:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much flour is in one bag. The problem states that one bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

This means one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour.

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[
\boxed{48}

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Now, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked:
- Total distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

So, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
79 miles"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Bill to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- So, the time to dig through the soil is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes Bill to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, so he digs \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \) through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- So, the time to dig through the clay is \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we add the time for both the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time through soil + time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

So, the total number of likes now is \(\boxed{160000}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how much Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday. She bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

But she got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday. The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30, so the initial cost for 20 pomegranates is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Find the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne made $400 from red hats in the first month.
   - This amount is half of what she made from green hats.
   - So, the earnings from green hats in the first month are \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings in the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Earnings from red hats + Earnings from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the earnings in the second month:**
   - In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - So, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the two months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\) dollars."
"James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first hour is $15. Each hour after the first is twice the cost, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the first hour: $15
- Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

We are given:
- The total number of heads is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

Let's use \( S \) for the number of sheep and \( G \) for the number of geese.

From the heads:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

From the legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the legs equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To find \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( \boxed{15} \)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to know the current height of the bamboo in inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, and the bamboo is currently 20 feet tall, we convert this to inches:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The target height of the bamboo is 600 inches. To find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow, we subtract the current height from the target height:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**
20"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much Karen earns per hour. We know that Lorie earns $10 per hour, and Karen earns twice that amount. So, Karen earns:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many hours Karen works in two days. If she works 3 hours each day, then in two days she works:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Now, we calculate how much Karen earns in 6 hours at a rate of $20 per hour:
   \[
   20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the amount Karen earns in two days is \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns 96 potatoes can make by setting up a simple ratio.

First, let's see how many hash browns one potato can make:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if one potato makes 6 hash browns, then 96 potatoes will make:
\[ 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

The final answer is 576."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the total weight of the 8 adults. Since each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we multiply 80 kg by 8:
   \[
   80 \text{ kg/adult} \times 8 \text{ adults} = 640 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. Next, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Assuming Jack also weighs an average of 80 kg:
   \[
   640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. Now, we need to see how much this total weight exceeds the elevator's maximum load of 700 kg:
   \[
   720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

The final answer is 20 kg."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

Shania is making her dress longer. She extends it by 50% of its original length and then adds 20 cm of lace trim. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

Let's say the original length of the dress is \( x \) cm.

1. When she extends the dress by 50%, the length becomes \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).
2. Then she adds 20 cm of lace trim, so the total length is \( 1.5x + 20 \).

We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can write the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}

So, the number of cookies in the box is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets.
2. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
3. The combined ages of one twin and one triplet is 44.

Let's use some simple math:
- Let's say the age of the triplet is \( T \).
- The age of the twin is \( T + 7 \) because the twin is 7 years older than the triplet.

Now, we know that the sum of their ages is 44:
\[ T + (T + 7) = 44 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 2T = 37 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ T = 18.5 \]

So, the triplet is 18.5 years old. Now, we need to find the age of the twin:
\[ T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."
"John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. First, we convert the 3 hours into minutes:
\[3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}\]

Next, we add up the time John needs for his homework:
- Math homework: 20 minutes
- Reading homework: 40 minutes
- History homework: 20 minutes

Total time for homework:
\[20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}\]

Now, we subtract the time spent on homework from the total time before dinner to find out how many minutes John has left for a nap:
\[180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}\]

So, John has \(\boxed{100}\) minutes to nap."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one candy. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
This means each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, we need to find the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Rong saves 20 coins every month.
2. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. Over ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.

4. Rong's total savings over 120 months:
   \[
   20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]

5. Neil's total savings over 120 months:
   \[
   28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

6. Adding both totals together:

1. The dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's say the total bill is \( x \) dollars. So, the cost of the heartworm check is:
   \[
   0.6x
   \]

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[
   x = 40 + 0.6x
   \]

4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4x = 40
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
   \]

5. So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
   \[
   125 - 100 = 25
   \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple, so one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - Therefore, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, let's add up all the squares:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know there are 8 high chairs. The problem states that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, we calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
This means there are 40 regular chairs.

Next, we need to find out the total number of chairs currently available:
\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \]
So, there are 48 chairs in total right now.

Now, we need to figure out how many chairs are needed for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the number of chairs needed:
\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many bucks there are. We know that 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks.
   \[
   \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \times 0.5 = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 bucks.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 point bucks. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points.
   \[
   \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.2 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 8 point bucks.

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Adam's Points**: Adam has 50 points.
2. **Betty's Points**: Betty has 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of 50 and add it to 50:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. **Tom's Points**: Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we subtract 30 from Betty's points:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. **Marta's Points**: Marta has 3 times the points that Tom has. So, we multiply Tom's points by 3:

So, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Greta's total paycheck is $2400.
2. She puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account. So, we calculate 50% of $2400:
   \[
   2400 \times 0.50 = 1200
   \]
   This means she puts $1200 into her retirement account.
3. She uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. So, we calculate 20% of $2400:
   \[
   2400 \times 0.20 = 480
   \]
   This means she uses $480 for her car payment.
4. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amounts she spent from her total paycheck:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many people are in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is:
   \[
   13 + 7 = 20
   \]

2. Each person gets a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. Since there are 20 people, the group will need:
   - 20 drinks (because each person gets 2 drinks)
   - 60 snacks (because each person gets 3 snacks, and \(20 \times 3 = 60\))

3. Each drink costs $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:
   \[

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. So, we add 800 pounds to Gissela's truck capacity:
   \[
   4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The total capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We know Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul 4,000 pounds and 4,800 pounds respectively. So, we need to find out how much Gary's truck can haul. We set up the equation:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600
   \]
4. Let's call Gary's truck capacity \( x \). So the equation becomes:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 + x = 11600
   \]
5. Simplify the left side:
   \[
   8800 + x = 11600
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we subtract 8800 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 11600 - 8800

   - There are 6 females.
   - There are 8 males, including Larry.

2. **Dumplings Eaten:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

3. **Total Dumplings Eaten by Females:**
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

4. **Total Dumplings Eaten by Males:**
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

5. **Total Dumplings Cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = dumplings eaten by females + dumplings eaten by males.

First, we need to figure out how much money Gerald and Julia each got when they divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.

The total parts of the ratio are \(3 + 2 = 5\).

Gerald's share is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $100:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 100 = 60
\]

So, Gerald got $60.

If Gerald spent $10 on a book, we need to subtract that from his total:
\[
60 - 10 = 50

"The cat can run at 15 feet per second, and it is 5 times faster than the turtle. So, to find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"The firefighters have a goal of raising $6300. After 3 hours, they have raised $2100. To find out how much more they need to raise, we subtract the amount they have already raised from their goal:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

So, they need to raise $4200 more. We know they raised $2100 in 3 hours, so they raise $700 per hour:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

To find out how many more hours they need to raise the remaining $4200, we divide $4200 by $700:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to fundraise for 6 more hours. Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of that 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out how much of the river's water is used for industrial purposes:
\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

This means 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes.

Next, we need to find out how much of the river's water is used for non-industrial purposes. Since the city uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes, the remaining percentage is for non-industrial purposes:
\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To find out how many quarts of ice cream are made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream and then use those rates to find the total production.

1. **Chocolate Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
   - So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) quarts.
   - In 48 hours, it would make \( 50 \times 48 = 2400 \) quarts.

2. **Vanilla Ice Cream:**
   - The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
   - So, in 1 hour, it makes \( \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \) quarts.
   - In 48 hours, it would make \( 12.5 \times 48 = 600 \) quarts.

3. **Total Quarts:**
   - Adding the quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together:
     \[
     2400 + 600 = 3000 \text{ quarts}
     \]

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is \(\boxed{3000}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

Erin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's find out how much it costs to get 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy.
2. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and there are 14 days in two weeks. So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces in two weeks.
3. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, and there are 14 days in two weeks. So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces in two weeks.
4. After two weeks, Ginger has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
5. After two weeks, Amy has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.
6. To find out how much more candy Amy has, we subtract Ginger's remaining candy from Amy's remaining candy: \(58 - 44 = 14\).

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cost to Go Picking:** James had to pay $20 just to go picking.
2. **Cost per Pound:** For each pound of blueberries, it costs an additional $1.5.
3. **Pounds of Blueberries Picked:** James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.

First, we calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- The initial cost is $20.
- The cost for 30 pounds at $1.5 per pound is \(30 \times 1.5 = 45\).

So, the total cost of picking the blueberries is:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \]

Next, we calculate the cost if James had bought the blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
- For 30 pounds, the cost would be \(30 \times 2.5 = 75\).

Now, we find out how much James saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

So, James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."

So, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

Next, we know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's call the length of Bobby's shoe \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that a gallon jar costs $5. We also know that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. So, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to find out how much Cecelia spends on 10 gallon jars. Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallon jars is:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Then, we need to find out how much she spends on 16 half-gallon jars. Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars is:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money she spent is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 50 students in total.
2. 10 students like to bake.
3. 5 students like to play basketball.
4. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) students.

Now, let's add up the students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:
\[10 \, (\text{baking}) + 5 \, (\text{basketball}) + 10 \, (\text{music}) = 25\]

To find out how many students like to play video games, we subtract the number of students who like the other activities from the total number of students:
\[50 - 25 = 25\]

So, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard. After throwing a stone, 1/3 of the birds flew away. So, the number of birds that flew away is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

This means the number of birds left is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the ones that were still there. So, the total number of birds now is:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

**Final Answer: 28**"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Total Students and Classes:**
   - There are 80 students in total.
   - These students are divided into 2 classes, so each class has:
     \[
     \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students}
     \]

2. **Girls in Each Class:**
   - 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   - So, the number of girls in each class is:
     \[
     0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls}
     \]

3. **Boys in Each Class:**
   - Each class has 40 students in total.
   - If 16 of them are girls, then the number of boys is:
     \[
     40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys}
     \]

So, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"Melissa has a total of 8 dogs to bathe, 5 cats to clip nails, 3 birds to trim wings, and 12 horses to brush. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we need to add up all these animals first:

\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:

\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{4}\)"
"Mark bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each. So, the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

He got 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 more cards each worth $50. The total value of the 30 additional cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(26 \times 2 = 52\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park:
- The savings is the difference between the cost of the first amusement park and the second amusement park, which is \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, the amount they will save by choosing the second amusement park is \(\boxed{28}\) dollars."

2. Now, the new vendor sells them for $0.4 each.
3. The difference in price per tomato is $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1.
4. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
5. So, the daily savings are $0.1 * 500 = $50.
6. There are 7 days in a week.
7. Therefore, the weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, Carl has:
   \[
   4 \times 56 = 224 \text{ marbles}
   \]
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, Cal has:
   \[
   2 \times 56 = 112 \text{ marbles}
   \]
4. To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:
   \[

   \]

So, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is \(\boxed{336}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 54 students and we need to divide them into 6 equal groups. To find out how many students are in each group, we divide 54 by 6:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]
So, each of the 6 groups has 9 students.

Next, the activity requires 12 groups. To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we already have (6) from the total number of groups required (12):
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Therefore, we need 6 more groups to form the required 12 groups.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Weekends:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total in one 4-week month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total in two 4-week months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

So, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24

   So, Gunther is left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. Arnold steals 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther adds another 6 bananas:

So, the final number of bananas in the pile is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total monthly electricity bill is $100.
2. There are 5 people (Jenna and her 4 roommates) sharing the bill equally.
3. To find out how much each person pays monthly, we divide the total bill by the number of people:
   \[
   \text{Monthly share} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Now, to find out how much each person pays annually, we multiply the monthly share by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Annual share} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."
"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for a party. 

First, let's convert dozens to individual items:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. 

Now, let's subtract the broken items from the initial amount:
- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

So, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. The trading rules are:
- Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.
- A small sticker is worth one small button.
- A large button is worth three small stickers.

First, Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
- 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
- Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
- 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
- Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

Then, she trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons:
- Remaining large stickers = 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers.
- Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

Now, let's add up all the buttons:
- Small buttons: 27
- Large buttons: 20
- Small buttons from large stickers: 60

Total buttons = 27 (small) + 20 (large) + 60 (small) = 107

So, the final number of buttons Lorraine has is \(\boxed{107}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. Let's say the number of votes against the regulation is \( x \). Then, the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is 33. So, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's add up all the shirts:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

2. Next, we subtract the number of people who think horse #2 will win from the total number of people to find out how many are left:
   - 50 people - 10 people = 40 people

3. Then, we find out how many of the remaining people think horse #7 will win:
   - 60% of 40 people = \(0.60 \times 40 = 24\) people

4. Finally, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people to find out how many think horse #12 will win:

We know that the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Let's say the first house needs \( x \) cases of shingles. 

- The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs twice as much as the first house).
- The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (since it needs twice as much as the first house).

So, the total number of cases can be written as:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

"Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. The original price of the laptop is $1000.
2. You get a 20% discount. To find out how much the discount is, you calculate 20% of $1000.
3. 20% of $1000 is \( 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 200 \).
4. So, the discount is $200.
5. To find the final price you have to pay, subtract the discount from the original price: \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \).

So, after the discount, you have to pay $800.

The final answer is $800."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mike has a total of 600 movies.
2. A third of these movies are in series, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies in series}
   \]
3. Each series movie costs $6, so:
   \[
   200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The remaining movies are:
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
   \]
5. 40% of these remaining movies are older movies, so:
   \[
   0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies}
   \]
6. Each older movie costs $5, so:
   \[
   160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]
7. The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies, so:
   \[
   400 - 160 = 240 \text{ normal movies}
   \]
8. Each normal movie costs $10, so:
   \[
   240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
9. The total cost is the sum of all these amounts:
   \[
   1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost to replace Mike's movie collection is:
\[
\boxed{4400}
\]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Driving Time and Speed:**
   - The Llesis family drove for 4.5 hours (since they spent 1.5 hours hiking out of the total 6 hours).
   - Their driving speed was 50 miles per hour.
   - So, the distance they drove is \(4.5 \times 50 = 225\) miles.

2. **Hiking Speed and Time:**
   - They hiked for 1.5 hours.
   - Their hiking speed was half of their driving speed minus 5 miles per hour, which is \(\frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20\) miles per hour.
   - So, the distance they hiked is \(1.5 \times 20 = 30\) miles.

3. **Total Distance:**
   - The total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the driving distance and the hiking distance.
   - Total distance = \(225 + 30 = 255\) miles.

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is \(\boxed{255}\) miles."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game level. The points are calculated as follows:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
- 5 points for each berry collected.
- 30 points for each second left on the timer when they finish the level.

Let's say Emma jumps on \( E_e \) enemies, collects \( E_b \) berries, and finishes with \( E_t \) seconds left on the timer. Then Ava jumps on \( E_e + 8 \) enemies, collects \( E_b + 3 \) berries, and finishes with \( E_t + 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

Now, let's calculate the scores:
- Emma's score: \( 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \)
- Ava's score: \( 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \)
  \[
  10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215
  \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[
(10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) = 215
\]

So, the difference between their two scores is \(\boxed{215}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total cost for four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost:
   \[
   64 - 30 = 34
   \]
4. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
   \[
   34 \div 2 = 17
   \]

So, each of the other two pizzas costs $17.

The final answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white. He then bought some more fish from a pet store, and after adding them to his pond, he found that he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\).

After buying the fish, the total number of orange fish is \(3 + O\) and the total number of white fish is \(4 + W\). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Now, let's solve this equation. First, expand the right side:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Next, we need to isolate \(O\) and \(W\). Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[O = 8 + 2W - 3\]

Simplify the right side:

\[O = 5 + 2W\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(O = 5 + 2W\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[(5 + 2W) + W = 17\]

Combine like terms:

\[5 + 3W = 17\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[3W = 12\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. 

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants in his garden. Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants. To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- He has 5 tomato plants.
So, the total number of tomatoes is:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- He has 8 eggplant plants.
So, the total number of eggplants is:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[ 50 + 150 = 200 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more John needs to raise to cover the total cost of the trip:
\[ 300 - 200 = 100 \]

So, John is missing \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. At night, it gets 33 degrees colder, so the temperature at night is:

\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes in Carson's house will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees. To keep the pipes from freezing, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees. The difference in temperature he needs to raise is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood Carson burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs he needs to burn, we divide the temperature difference by the temperature increase per log:

\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."

"Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. First, let's add these up to find the total number of stuffed animals she currently has:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's say she buys \( x \) stuffed goats. After buying the goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We need to find \( x \) such that the number of stuffed goats is 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This can be written as:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Distribute the 0.30 on the right side:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

2. Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

3. Simplify the left side:
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

4. Divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of the materials. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of materials} = 600 + 300 = 900
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate the 30% premium on the total cost of the materials. To do this, we multiply the total cost by 30% (or 0.30).
   \[
   \text{Premium} = 900 \times 0.30 = 270
   \]

3. Finally, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials to find out how much James paid.
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 900 + 270 = 1170
   \]

So, the final amount James paid is:
\[
\boxed{1170}

"To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third-graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
   - Fourth-graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
   - Fifth-graders: The pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders. Since the fourth graders' pass rate is 40%, the fifth graders' pass rate is \(2 \times 40\% = 80\%\). So, \(80\% \times 400 = 320\) fifth-graders passed.

2. **Calculate the total number of students who passed:**
   - Third-graders: 340
   - Fourth-graders: 40
   - Fifth-graders: 320
   - Total number of students who passed: \(340 + 40 + 320 = 700\)

3. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Third-graders: 500
   - Fourth-graders: 100
   - Fifth-graders: 400
   - Total number of students: \(500 + 100 + 400 = 1000\)

4. **Calculate the overall pass rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = \(\frac{700}{1000} = 0.7\) or 70%

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

**Final Answer:**
70%"
"Milo is making a mosaic with glass chips. He needs 12 chips to make each square inch of the mosaic. Each bag of glass chips contains 72 chips, and he has 2 bags. He wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much tea the students drank in total.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, add the amounts together to find the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the fact that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \text{ gallons} \]"
"Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. Then he ordered 100 more candies. To find out how many candies he still needs to sell, let's break it down:

1. Dale initially had 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies, but since he only had 100, he must have ordered more to meet the demand.
3. He then ordered 100 more candies, so now he has:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial)} + 100 \text{ (ordered)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]
4. He has already sold 150 candies, so the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
   \[
   200 \text{ (total)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus.

- At the end of January, the number of students doubles: \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
- At the end of February, the number doubles again: \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
- At the end of March, the number doubles again: \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
- At the end of April, the number doubles again: \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
- At the end of May, the number doubles again: \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

So, by the end of May, there are 320 students on campus.

To find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

**310**"
"Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find out how many branches he climbed, we divide $105 by $0.25:

\[
\frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

\[
\frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

So, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Tanya makes a salt scrub using salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as citrus zest.

Let's use a variable to represent the amount of citrus zest. We'll call it \( z \).

1. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \).
2. The amount of salt is \( s \).
3. The amount of sugar is the same as the amount of salt, so it is also \( s \).
4. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so it is \( 2s \).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

We can divide the entire equation by 2:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

Since \( z \) is the amount of citrus zest and \( s \) is the amount of salt, we can solve for \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

We need to find the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \). From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say PJ has \(P\) cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341.

So, we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combine like terms:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

Now, we know PJ has 47 cards. So, Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, let's add up the total number of clay dishes:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"Erika is saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one is reduced by $200, making it $400. She has some money in her purse, $150 from her part-time job, and $80 from her mom. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The reduced price of the laptop is $400.
2. Erika needs $50 more to buy the laptop, so she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.
3. The money she has includes the money in her purse, $150 from her job, and $80 from her mom. So, the total money she has is the sum of these amounts.

Let's set up the equation:
\[ \text{Money in purse} + 150 + 80 = 350 \]

Now, solve for the money in her purse:
\[ \text{Money in purse} + 230 = 350 \]
\[ \text{Money in purse} = 350 - 230 \]
\[ \text{Money in purse} = 120 \]

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many slices Adam gets from the large apples. Since each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and he has 3 large apples, he gets:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples. Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, and he has 5 small apples, so he gets:
   \[
   5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples to find the total number of slices:
   \[
   15 + 15 = 30 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract the slices he ate from the total number of slices:
   \[
   30 - 15 = 15 \text{ slices}
   \]

So, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently gets 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. So, with 3 cows, he gets:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

He wants to get 25 liters of milk a day. The difference is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow gives 5 liters a day, he needs:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to get 25 liters of milk a day.

**Answer:** 2"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length is 12 millimeters, the unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the unused lengths:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[

First, let's find out the total cost of the car and the phone:
\[ \$10,000 + \$800 = \$10,800 \]

Next, let's see how much money Gabriel has in total:
\[ \$5,000 + \$200 = \$5,200 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Gabriel needs:
\[ \$10,800 - \$5,200 = \$5,600 \]

So, Gabriel still needs \(\$5,600\)."
"Thea bought a hat for $70 and gave the craftsman four $20 bills. Four $20 bills total to $80. So, the change she received is $80 - $70 = $10.

"Craig starts with 2 twenty-dollar bills, which means he has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

He buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the total cost for the squirt guns is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

He also buys three packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the total cost for the water balloons is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.

The total amount spent is \(12 + 9 = 21\) dollars.

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money he had: \(40 - 21 = 19\) dollars.

So, the amount of money Craig has left is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."

1. We know there are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both subjects. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is \(\boxed{12}\)."

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that gives her an interest of three-quarters of the original amount each year. 

First, we need to find out how much interest she gets each year:
\[ \text{Interest per year} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is simple, it means the interest is the same each year. So, for 3 years, the total interest will be:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 years} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add this total interest to the original amount to find out how much she will have after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total amount after 3 years} = 300 + 675 = 975 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{975} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - So, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **White Shirts without Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 of them have collars, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts without Buttons:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs. Each tray holds 30 eggs, and the farmer has 900 eggs. So, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:
   \[
   \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate how much the farmer will earn by selling these trays. Each tray is sold for $2.5. So, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many rooms make up one-half of the motel:
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

2. Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean each room. So, to find out how long it takes to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean one room:
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total time in minutes by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let's say your brother's age is \( B \).
2. You are three years younger than your brother, so your age \( Q \) is \( B - 3 \).
3. You are two years older than your sister, so your sister's age \( S \) is \( Q - 2 \). Since \( Q = B - 3 \), your sister's age is \( (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \).
4. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom's age is \( 3B - 1 \).
5. The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can write the equation: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

Now, substitute \( Q \) and \( S \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find your age \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add this to the amount after the heavy rain:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Day 0**: We start with 10 people infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people get infected. The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Now, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others. So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people get infected. The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others. So, \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people get infected. The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the 40 customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate the total amount as follows:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]

So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we calculate:

\[ 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]

So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

Now, to find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which means she gave away \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

1. **Total Burritos Ordered**: George ordered 600 burritos.
2. **Burritos for Students**: There are 50 students, and each student gets 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos for students is \(50 \times 10 = 500\).
3. **Burritos for Mr. George**: Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
4. **Total Burritos Consumed**: The total number of burritos consumed is the sum of the burritos for students and the burritos Mr. George ate, which is \(500 + 20 = 520\).
5. **Leftover Burritos**: The number of leftover burritos is the total number of burritos ordered minus the total number of burritos consumed, which is \(600 - 520 = 80\).

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. So, the number of yellow cars is:

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use some letters to represent the number of books each person has:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."
"Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. The sweet potatoes weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so the sweet potatoes weighed \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. The carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs. Since there are 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, we calculate:
\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many 3-ounce boxes of jello are needed. Since 3 ounces of jello make 10 cups, we divide the total number of cups by 10:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost. Each 3-ounce box of jello costs $1.25, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

So, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:
\[ \boxed{15.00} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of one bottle of soda. We know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00. So, the cost of one bottle of soda is:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find the cost of one bottle of water. We know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00. So, the cost of one bottle of water is:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 16 bolts will cost. Each bolt costs $0.03. So, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost per bolt:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

This means the total cost for 16 bolts is $0.48.

Now, we subtract this cost from the amount of money David has:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find out how much she earns per hour, we divide $33 by 3 hours:

   9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is \(\boxed{7000}\)."
"Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold an equal number of glasses. To find out how many glasses Micah sold, we first need to figure out how many glasses the boys sold in total. 

Total glasses sold by Julie and the boys: 32
Glasses sold by Julie: 14
So, glasses sold by the boys: 32 - 14 = 18

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide the 18 glasses by 2:
18 ÷ 2 = 9

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold:
14 - 9 = 5

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out her current age, we subtract 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
So, we need to find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old. We can set up the equation:
\[ 8 + x = 24 \]
where \( x \) is the number of years from now. Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore, and the total time is 65 minutes.

Let's say her usual concert length is \( x \) minutes. Then, the final concert length would be \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We know the final concert length is 65 minutes, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The singer has 50 microphones and 20% of them won't find a space to fit in. First, we need to find out how many microphones won't fit.

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. This means the number of microphones that can be paired is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones can be made from 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step!

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
2. A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, if we let the speed of the thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second, then:
   \[
   11v = 121
   \]
3. To find \( v \), we divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
4. Now, a whirligig spins 5 times the speed of a thingamabob. So, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$480/\text{week} \]

So, Mark makes \(\$480\) a week."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We need to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's figure out how much she made from mowing lawns. We know:
- Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.
- Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's.
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times. Then:
- She mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- She mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

The total amount she earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that the total amount she made is $80. So, the amount she made from mowing lawns plus the amount she made from lemonade sales equals $80:
\[ 54J + \text{(amount from lemonade sales)} = 80 \]

To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we need to solve for the amount from lemonade sales:
\[ \text{Amount from lemonade sales} = 80 - 54J \]

Since \( J \) must be a whole number and the amount from lemonade sales must be a positive number, the smallest possible value for \( J \) is 1. If \( J = 1 \):
\[ \text{Amount from lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

So, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

   \]
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:
   \[
   \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. He and his wife are adults, and they have 2 children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, we need to figure out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

First, let's see how much soup the family will use for dinner:
- Calvin and his wife need 2 adult bowls.
- The 2 children need 2 child bowls.
- So, the family will use a total of 2 (adult) + 2 (child) = 4 bowls for dinner.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, it means the pot has enough soup for 4 adult bowls. After the family eats 4 bowls, there is no soup left for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent $8.00 in all."
"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much material is needed for one small mask. We know that 4 small masks require 2 yards of material. So, for one small mask, Jo needs:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one small mask by 20:
\[ 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} \times 20 \text{ masks} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we need to determine how much material is needed for one large mask. We know that 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material. So, for one large mask, Jo needs:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for one large mask by 8:
\[ 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} \times 8 \text{ masks} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Finally, to find the total amount of material needed, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, Jo needs a total of 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

So, Harold has \(\boxed{5}\) hours of free time left in his day."
"Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes and \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes for fishing.

First, let's figure out how many blue shoe boxes are left:
- Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
- So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is \(7 - 3 = 4\).

Next, let's figure out how many red shoe boxes are left:
- Tim starts with 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes.
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) of 9 is \(9 \div 3 = 3\).
- So, the number of red shoe boxes left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

Therefore, the number of blue shoe boxes left is 4, and the number of red shoe boxes left is 6.

The final answer is:
\[
4 \text{ blue shoe boxes and } 6 \text{ red shoe boxes}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Duncan's current age is 60. The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. 

First, let's figure out Duncan's age eight years ago:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

So, eight years ago, Duncan was 52 years old. According to the problem, this age (52) is two times Adam's age four years ago. Let's represent Adam's age four years ago as \( A - 4 \), where \( A \) is Adam's current age. The equation becomes:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

First, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add the sizes of both farms to find the total:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the two farms together have a total of 700 acres."
"Colby works in a packaging division and gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which means he completes 40 packages per hour. In an eight-hour workday, he completes:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Since he gets paid $0.20 for each package, his earnings for the day are:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there were 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces/balloon} \times 20 \text{ balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons. We know the total number of pieces thrown is 58, so we subtract the pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces} = 18 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to find out how many yellow balloons there are. Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, we divide the remaining pieces by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/balloon}} = 6 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many miles Jon drives in a month. He drives 100 miles each day and there are 30 days in the month. So, we multiply the miles per day by the number of days:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many tune-ups Jon's car needs. His car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, we divide the total miles driven by the number of miles needed for a tune-up:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs \(\boxed{3}\) tune-ups in that time."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   He works twice the time he worked on Tuesday. So, he works:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}

2. The number of students playing volleyball is twice the number playing tennis, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students.
3. For soccer, there are 16 boys and 22 girls, so the total number of students playing soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\).

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of students:

\[6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56\]

So, the total number of students is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Lollipops Sold:**
   - There are 30 students.
   - Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - So, the total number of lollipops sold is \(30 \times 10 = 300\).

2. **Total Revenue:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \(300 \times 0.8 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - So, the total cost is \(300 \times 0.5 = 150\) dollars.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
   - Therefore, the profit is \(240 - 150 = 90\) dollars.

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in each mini pastry. 

- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal one, each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. Since a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal one, each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.

Next, we calculate the total calories for all the mini pastries Andrew baked.

- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Finally, we add the calories from both types of pastries to get the total:

\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \]

So, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is \( 85000 \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Monday**: Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
2. **Tuesday**: She removed twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
3. **Wednesday**: Again, twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
4. **Thursday**: She removed 48 Junebugs.
5. **Friday**: She removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs she removed:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

First, add 39 and 78:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]

Next, add 78:

\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]

Then, add 48:

\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]

Finally, add 57:

\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed is 300.

To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5 days):

\[
\frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

First, we need to find out how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, the distance the bus traveled is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how far the car traveled. The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, the distance the car traveled is:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car. We do this by subtracting the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the total number of toys Sophie has is 62. We also know the number of each type of toy except for the bouncy balls:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we need to add up the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings, and then subtract that sum from the total number of toys.

So, let's add the number of building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. So, we can write:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
\[ Pa = J + 10 \]

And Peter’s age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages:
\[ P = Pa + J \]

First, let's substitute \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So, the age of Peter is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, Maria's mom gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons from mom: 15

So, the total number of balloons is \(8 + 1 + 15 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."

2. We also know they already have 10 boxes. So, the total number of boxes is:
   \[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

3. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. To find out how many tables are needed, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
   \[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

4. They already own 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

First, we need to find out how far Zoey and Sydney spit their seeds in total.

For Zoey:
- She has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 10 feet.
- So, the total distance Zoey spits her seeds is \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

For Sydney:
- She has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 12 feet.
- So, the total distance Sydney spits her seeds is \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Next, we need to find the average of these two totals. To do that, we add the two totals together and then divide by 2.

The total distance spat by both is \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

The average total distance spat is \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

So, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."

"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which means he stays for 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For the additional hours, it charges 70 pesos per hour.

First, we calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would be 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:

   \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. He buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. He wants to buy 25 dollar pens with the remaining $100.
   \[
   \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens}
   \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many letters Craig has spelled. Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word has 15 letters. So, we multiply the number of words by the number of letters in each word:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

So, Craig has spelled 300 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled. The problem states that Craig's brother has spelled 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the number of letters Craig spelled:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

So, Craig's brother has spelled 350 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters they both have spelled, we add the number of letters Craig spelled to the number of letters his brother spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. So, for one school, the number of children is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).
4. There are 5 different schools.
5. Therefore, the total number of children is \(56 \times 5 = 280\).

So, the total number of children in the drill is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:
   \[
   9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
   \[
   29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:
   \[
   900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles}
   \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[
\boxed{842}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Visit Charge**: Patty's Plumbing charges $40 just to visit the house.
2. **Labor Charge**: They charge $35 per hour. For 2.25 hours, the labor charge is \(35 \times 2.25 = 78.75\).
3. **Parts Charge**: The job used $60 in parts.

Now, let's add these up:
- Visit Charge: $40
- Labor Charge: $78.75
- Parts Charge: $60

Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

So, the total charge for the job is $178.75."
"James buys 10 CDs, each costing $15. He gets them for 40% off. First, let's find the total cost before the discount:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 = \$150 \]

Now, with a 40% discount, the discount amount is:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each. The total money he gets from selling these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$40 = \$200 \]

Since he only spent $90 for the 10 CDs and sold 5 of them for $200, he actually made a profit. The money he was out is the initial cost, which is:

\[ \boxed{\$90} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Jen has:
- 6 yams, each selling for $1.5
- 10 sweet potatoes, each selling for $2
- 4 carrots, each selling for $1.25

First, calculate the total earnings from the yams:
\[ 6 \text{ yams} \times \$1.5 \text{ per yam} = \$9 \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from the sweet potatoes:
\[ 10 \text{ sweet potatoes} \times \$2 \text{ per sweet potato} = \$20 \]

Then, calculate the total earnings from the carrots:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots} \times \$1.25 \text{ per carrot} = \$5 \]

Finally, add up all the earnings:
\[ \$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34 \]

So, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - The total distance of the lake is 20 miles.
   - James swims 60% of the distance.
   - So, the distance he swims initially is \(20 \times 0.60 = 12\) miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - The time to swim 12 miles is \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours.

3. **Calculate the rest time:**
   - After swimming, he rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   - So, the rest time is \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - The total distance is 20 miles.
   - He has already swum 12 miles.
   - So, the remaining distance is \(20 - 12 = 8\) miles.

5. **Calculate the new swimming speed:**
   - His original speed is 2 miles per hour.
   - He swims at half this speed for the remaining distance.
   - So, the new speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \).

6. **Calculate the time to swim the remaining distance:**
   - The remaining distance is 8 miles.
   - His new speed is 1 mile per hour.
   - So, the time to swim 8 miles is \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Time to swim the initial distance: 6 hours.
   - Rest time: 3 hours.
   - Time to swim the remaining distance: 8 hours.
   - Total time: \(6 + 3 + 8 = 17\) hours.

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is \(7 \times 70 = 490\).
3. The bakery has 40 less than this amount, so we subtract 40 from 490: \(490 - 40 = 450\).

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"Jasmine starts with 0 stickers. She gets 15 stickers for participating in class, so she now has 15 stickers. Then she loses 7 stickers during playtime, leaving her with \(15 - 7 = 8\) stickers. Finally, she gets 5 more stickers for helping her classmates, so she ends up with \(8 + 5 = 13\) stickers.

The final number of stickers Jasmine has is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **New York Times:**
   - Each copy costs $5.
   - Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = $5 × 10% = $5 × 0.10 = $0.50.
   - He sold 6 copies.
   - Total commission from New York Times = $0.50 × 6 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Each copy costs $15.
   - Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Commission per copy = $15 × 8% = $15 × 0.08 = $1.20.
   - He sold 10 copies.
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal = $1.20 × 10 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is \(\boxed{15}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, so we subtract 5 from 26 to find Marcus's age:
   \[
   26 - 5 = 21
   \]
   So, Marcus is 21 years old.
3. Marcus is also half of Leo’s age. This means if we double Marcus's age, we get Leo’s age:
   \[
   21 \times 2 = 42
   \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

The final answer is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. Bahati scored the most points, 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's say Bahati scored \( B \) points. Then:
- Azibo scored \( B - 20 \) points.
- Dinar scored \( B - 10 \) points.

The total points they scored together is:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]

Next, we solve for \( B \):
\[ 3B = 45 + 30 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

So, Bahati scored 25 points. Now, we can find out how many points Azibo scored:
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. The book is 1.5 inches thick.

To find out how many pages are in the book, we first calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate. Since 1 inch of paper can hold 100 pages, 1.5 inches can hold:

\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

However, since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we divide the total number of pages by 2:

\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. He was stapling from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

First, let's find out how many hours he worked:
From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

Now, convert 15 hours into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can find the total number of reports he stapled:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Kim's usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
   - That's 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine her wake-up time on the day in question:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time she was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time she was sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time she was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the time she was asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total time awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes

So, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 24 measuring cups because two dozen is 24.

He has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]
Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

He gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[
16 - 6 = 10
\]

Now, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has:
\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has 1000 beds.
   - 1/5 of the beds are occupied, so \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds are occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially is \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, 700 more beds are occupied.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is **100**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. So, the number of non-work emails is \(16 - 7 = 9\).
4. Two-thirds of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family. So, the number of emails sent to family is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\).
5. This means the remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are \(9 - 6 = 3\).
6. One-third of these remaining 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1\).

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, we calculate Shawna's age as:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we calculate Shawna's father's age as:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}

"If Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly said Courtney was wrong and had overestimated by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people.

Let's call the actual number of people \( x \). If Courtney overestimated by 20%, that means Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. So, we can write:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.2:

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. If we let the number of balls Jeffrey carried be \( J \), then Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
2. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.
3. The total number of balls carried by all three boys is the sum of the balls each carried: \( J + 2J + 4J = 7J \).
4. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \).
5. Substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls, we get \( 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \).

So, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

We know that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. Since they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, by the end of the fourth day, they had:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. So, together they got:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins got 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey. So, Collins got:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

So, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. 

First, we find 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
3. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.
4. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
   \]
   \[
   9A - 21 = 339
   \]
6. Add 21 to both sides:
   \[
   9A = 360
   \]
7. Divide both sides by 9:
   \[
   A = 40
   \]
8. Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \):
   \[
   4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
   \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long. We are told that the number of episodes is half the number of minutes in each episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"Sure, let's break down the bird's journey step by step.

1. **First Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 10 hours × 30 miles/hour = 300 miles.

2. **Second Leg:**
   - The bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 2 hours × 18 miles/hour = 36 miles.

3. **Third Leg:**
   - The bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Time × Speed = 5 hours × 22 miles/hour = 110 miles.

Now, let's find the total distance flown south and north:
- Total distance flown south = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles.
- Total distance flown north = 36 miles.

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
- Net distance = Total distance flown south - Total distance flown north = 410 miles - 36 miles = 374 miles.

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Greta made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she got an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. When she got home, her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the brownies that were eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:
\[ 48 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then add them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Now, we add up all the times:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

**Answer:** 227 minutes"
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Carlton's team has 13 players.
2. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find out how many players are on Zeke's team:
   \[
   13 + 7 = 20
   \]
3. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:
   \[
   13 + 20 = 33
   \]

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is \(\boxed{33}\)."
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the fence. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need \(\boxed{100}\) wooden slats."
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes. So, she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes left. She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes, which is 8 / 4 = 2 boxes. Therefore, she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, she sold 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \(\boxed{120}\)."

1. We know the USA has 50 states.
2. India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
3. Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
4. So, India has \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.
5. The total number of states in both countries together is \( 50 + 29 = 79 \).

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"Tyler wants to buy a dictionary, a dinosaur book, and a children's cookbook. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the cookbook costs $8. First, let's add up the total cost of the books:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

So, the total cost of the books is $39. Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler needs $25 more to buy the books. Since he earns $5 per hour, we can find out how many hours he needs to work by dividing the amount he needs by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

The answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has:
   \[
   60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries}
   \]
4. Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so the difference is:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20
   \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

**Saturday:**
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold \(10 - 4 = 6\) boxes of apple pie.

**Sunday:**
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

**Costs:**
- Gingerbread costs $6 per box.
- Apple pie costs $15 per box.

**Calculating earnings for Saturday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(10 \times 6 = 60\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars:
\[100 + 60 = 160\]

The total cost of both cars is $160."
"Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, that will be in 5 years. At that time:
- Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

To find their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so he is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so he is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so her friend gave her 20 × 2 = 40 beads.

To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add up all the beads:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
   \[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
   \[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players. We subtract the number of football players from the total number of students:
   \[
   30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students}
   \]

3. Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students}
   \]

4. Finally, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:
   \[
   6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]

So, the number of students leaving early is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's. Since Sophie wears size 5 boots, we can calculate the size of Charlie's boots as follows:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie, we add the sizes of their boots and then divide by 2:

\[ \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit**: The flower bed is 111 feet long, and each plant grows 12 inches wide. Since 12 inches is 1 foot, each plant takes up 1 foot of space.

2. **Space needed per plant**: Each plant needs 1 foot of space, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. So, the total space needed per plant is:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot (for the plant)} + 1.5 \text{ feet (space between plants)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of plants that can fit**: Divide the length of the flower bed by the total space needed per plant:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since Pat can only have whole plants, we take the integer part, which is 44 plants.

4. **Determine how many more plants are needed**: Pat already has 17 plants, so the number of additional plants needed is:
   \[
   44 - 17 = 27 \text{ plants}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**: Each plant costs $6, so the total cost for 27 plants is:
   \[
   27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is \(\boxed{162}\)."

First, we need to figure out how long it takes Emily to peel and sauté shrimp.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, it will take:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since Emily needs to do both tasks one after the other, we add the times together:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up by 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's find the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - So, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. This also amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights are to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, the remaining flights are \( F - \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{1}{4}F \). Since these are split equally, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

4. The second plane makes 44 flights, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes. So, \( F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \).

5. Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \).

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know the total age of the four children is 20. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's denote the ages of Helene and Wilfred as \(H\) and \(W\) respectively.

First, we can write the equation for the total age:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, we know that Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[\frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]

Since \(H + W = 13\), we can substitute this into the average age formula:
\[\frac{3 + 4 + 13}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\]

So, Helene's age \(H\) is twice this average:
\[H = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now we know Helene is 10 years old. We can find Wilfred's age \(W\) by using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

So, Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."

So, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. We have 2 adults and 4 kids, making a total of 6 people.
2. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.
3. Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \(x\). Then each adult gets a slice of size \(2x\).

4. The total number of slices is:
   - 2 adults each getting \(2x\), so \(2 \times 2x = 4x\)
   - 4 kids each getting \(x\), so \(4 \times x = 4x\)
   - Total slices = \(4x + 4x = 8x\)

5. The total size of the watermelon is \(8x\).

6. Each adult gets \(2x\). To find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The final answer is \(\boxed{25\%}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Doctor Jones spends 20 minutes on each inpatient and he has 9 inpatients. So, the total time for inpatient rounds is:
   \[
   9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. He also has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. So, the total time for appointments is:
   \[
   10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Adding the time for inpatient rounds and appointments gives:
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. Converting 480 minutes to hours:
   \[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide 64 by 4:
\[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide 56 by 7:
\[ \frac{56}{7} = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To find out how much it will cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so we use the formula:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So,
\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

The volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company says to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Now, calculate \( 1400 \times 5.9 \):
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Now, calculate \( 8260 \times 0.10 \):
\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Now, let's add them all up:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

So, the total number of sticks is \(9 + 14 + 11 = 34\).

Therefore, the total number of sticks they have is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Matteo traveled. He was traveling at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, we multiply his speed by the time he traveled:
\[ 55 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far Shandy traveled. She was traveling at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. So, we multiply her speed by the time she traveled:
\[ 45 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}

2. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Charge**: Let's say the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is \( x \).

2. **First 5 Hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
   \[
   x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5
   \]
   Calculating \( (0.91)^5 \):
   \[
   (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624
   \]
   So, after 5 hours, the charge is:
   \[
   x \times 0.624
   \]

3. **Next 3 Hours**: The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
   \[
   x \times 0.624 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times 0.624 \times (0.93)^3
   \]
   Calculating \( (0.93)^3 \):
   \[
   (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804
   \]
   So, after 8 hours, the charge is:
   \[
   x \times 0.624 \times 0.804
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   x \times 0.5018
   \]

4. **Final Charge**: We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. So:
   \[
   x \times 0.5018 = 0.28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.5018} \approx 0.5578
   \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank is approximately 56%.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

1. **Calculate Janet's Total Earnings per Hour:**
   - She earns $10 from wages and $15 from tips.
   - So, her total earnings per hour = $10 + $15 = $25.

2. **Calculate the Down Payment:**
   - She wants to save 20% of $10,000 for the down payment.
   - 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000.

3. **Calculate Janet's Weekly Earnings:**
   - She works 40 hours a week.
   - So, her weekly earnings = 40 hours × $25/hour = $1,000.

4. **Calculate the Number of Weeks Needed:**
   - To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount by her weekly earnings.
   - Number of weeks = $2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2 weeks.

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

- 4 pears at $0.50 each: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\) dollars
- 2 kiwis at $1.00 each: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\) dollars
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Now, let's add these amounts together to find the total cost:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

The price of carrots increases by 5% each year. If the initial price is $120, we need to find the price after 3 years.

First, let's understand what a 5% increase means. A 5% increase on $120 is:
\[ 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \]
So, the price after the first year is:
\[ 120 + 6 = 126 \]

Now, for the second year, the price increases by 5% of $126:
\[ 126 \times 0.05 = 6.3 \]
So, the price after the second year is:
\[ 126 + 6.3 = 132.3 \]

For the third year, the price increases by 5% of $132.3:
\[ 132.3 \times 0.05 = 6.615 \]
So, the price after the third year is:
\[ 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915 \]

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put them into 8 albums with the same number of pictures in each album. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, each album has 9 pictures.

Next, we know that 3 of the albums are only selfies and 2 of the albums are only portraits. Since each of these albums has 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits as follows:

For selfies:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For portraits:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Adding the selfies and portraits together gives us the total number of portraits and selfies:
\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is \(\boxed{45}\)."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4.
2. Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, so a large stuffed animal costs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.
3. Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
4. She earned a total of $120 from the sales.

Let's say Teresa sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals.

The money earned from the large stuffed animals is \(12x\) dollars (since each large one costs $12).
The money earned from the small stuffed animals is \(4 \times 2x = 8x\) dollars (since each small one costs $4 and she sold \(2x\) of them).

The total money earned is the sum of the money from the large and small stuffed animals:
\[12x + 8x = 120\]
\[20x = 120\]
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

So, Teresa sold \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\) small stuffed animals.

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."

3. **Normal Teacher Without Extension, Marcus Gets Personal Extension:**
   - There's a 60% chance the normal teacher doesn't give an extension.
   - Of those, there's a 20% chance Marcus gets a personal extension.
   - So, the combined chance is \(60\% \times 20\% = 12\%\).

Now, we add up the chances where Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher with extension: 40%
- Normal teacher without extension, Marcus gets personal extension: 12%

Total chance Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
\[ 50\% + 40\% + 12\% = 102\% \]

Since the total can't be more than 100%, we need to find the chance he does have to turn in his homework:
\[ 100\% - 102\% = -2\% \]

This means the chance he does have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 100\% - 102\% + 100\% = 89.8\% \]

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[ \boxed{89.8\%} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people.
2. 950 seats are for the graduates.
3. 300 seats are for the faculty.

First, we need to find out how many seats are left for friends and family. We do this by subtracting the seats for graduates and faculty from the total seats:

\[ 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 \]

So, there are 4750 seats left for friends and family.

Next, we need to divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would get 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer:**
5"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - So, the number of medium jelly beans is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Therefore, the number of small jelly beans equivalent to one medium jelly bean is 3.
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. The bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, let's find the dimensions of the fabric pieces:
- Length of each piece: \(6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}\)
- Width of each piece: \(8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's deliveries. One-fifth of 425 is 85, so on Tuesday they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they did on Tuesday. Twice 102 is 204, so on Wednesday they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the numbers together:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Winning amount: \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how tall Xavier is now. Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert 4 feet to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we find out how tall Cole is now. Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that three people divided $1920. Let's say the first person took \(x\) dollars.

- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \(x + 80\) dollars.
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \(2(x + 80)\) dollars.

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Next, we subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.

"Let's solve this step by step.

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this, let's combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To get rid of the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, let's find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. The car depreciates (loses value) at a rate of 21% per year. This means each year, the car is worth 79% of its value from the previous year.

To find the value of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years (from 2007 to 2010).

1. **First Year (2008):**
   \[
   \text{Value in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much the insurance cost after the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it increased by 60%.

2. To find the increase, we calculate 60% of $120:
   \[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

3. Now, we add this increase to the normal cost to get the new monthly cost:
   \[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

4. To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, the total amount James pays a year is \(\boxed{2304}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he uses \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets in a year.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week, so he uses \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets in a year.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Imma has 3 cats.
2. Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.
3. So, each cat eats \(60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day}\).
4. With 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed per day is \(120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}\).
5. Imma has 720 grams of cat food.
6. To find out how many days the cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption: \(\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}\).

So, 720 grams of cat food will last \(\boxed{2}\) days."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let's say Donovan's part of the meal took \(D\) minutes.
2. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes.
3. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:
   \[
   D + (D + 18) = 98
   \]
4. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   2D + 18 = 98
   \]
5. Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \(D\):
   \[
   2D = 80
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(D\):
   \[
   D = 40
   \]
7. So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part:
   \[
   D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
   \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

   \[
   300 \times 0.5 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: The cost is $4 per pill, and Hannah needs 30 pills, so:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: The parking costs $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours, so:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}

"James gets 80 emails a day. 20% of these emails don't need any response. So, let's find out how many emails don't need a response:

20% of 80 emails = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

This means 16 emails don't need a response. So, the number of emails that do need a response is:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

James responds to these 64 emails every day. In a 5-day work week, the number of emails he responds to is:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 320."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add them up:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192
\]

Then, add 192 and 30:

\[
192 + 30 = 222
\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:

\[
222 + 25 = 247
\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is \(\boxed{247}\)."

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.
   - 70% of 20 is \(20 \times 0.70 = 14\) pizzas.
   - So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas.
   - Therefore, the glee club has \(20 - 14 = 6\) pizzas left.

2. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club.
   - Since the glee club ordered 20 pizzas, the football team ordered \(2 \times 20 = 40\) pizzas.
   - The football team ate 80% of their pizzas.
   - 80% of 40 is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\) pizzas.
   - So, the football team ate 32 pizzas.
   - Therefore, the football team has \(40 - 32 = 8\) pizzas left.

3. Now, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team.
   - The glee club has 6 pizzas left.
   - The football team has 8 pizzas left.
   - So, the total number of pizzas left is \(6 + 8 = 14\).

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big coupon costs 15 cents.

First, calculate the number of big coupons:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, calculate the cost for the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Then, calculate the cost for the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, add the costs together to find the total cost:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the initial order is \(7 \times 4 = 28\).

2. **Meatballs Eaten by Mark:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, the number of meatballs Mark ate is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).

3. **Remaining Meatballs After Mark Ate:**
   - The number of meatballs remaining after Mark ate is \(28 - 16 = 12\).

4. **Additional Order:**

"Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours after the trucks left, he found out that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical problems. So, the number of trucks with problems was:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means 5 trucks couldn't deliver their load. Therefore, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser was:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers was:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

The total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is \(\boxed{300}\)."

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, you get an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}

"Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. The theater charges $125 to rent it for up to 20 people. For each additional person, it costs $6. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. But 4 people couldn't come.

First, let's find out how many people will actually come to the party:
- Classmates: 25
- Dance class girls: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45
- People who couldn't come: 4
- People who will come: 45 - 4 = 41

Now, we need to calculate the cost:
- The base cost for the first 20 people is $125.
- The number of additional people is 41 - 20 = 21.
- The cost for each additional person is $6, so for 21 additional people, the cost is 21 * $6 = $126.

Adding the base cost and the additional cost:
- Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

So, the total cost of the party is \(\boxed{251}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much money Maggie originally had. We know that Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. So, if we let \( M \) be the original amount of money Maggie had, we can write:

\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]

To find \( M \), we can multiply both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]

So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, let's figure out how much money Riza originally had. We know that Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. So, if we let \( R \) be the original amount of money Riza had, we can write:

\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]

To find \( R \), we can multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):

\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]

So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:

\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

So, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many bananas each monkey eats in a week.
2. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. The total number of bananas bought is 315. So, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]
6. Since the third monkey eats the same number of bananas each day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
   \[
   \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

Therefore, the answer is 750 pieces."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 15 roses cost. We know that a dozen roses (12 roses) cost $15. So, the cost of one rose is:

\[ \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of 15 roses:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny brought five $5 bills, which is:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Jenny should get back is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}

First, we calculate the total money made from the milkshakes:
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
- So, \(6 \times 5.50 = 33\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total money made from the burger platters:
- Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
- So, \(9 \times 11 = 99\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the total money made from the sodas:
- Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
- So, \(20 \times 1.50 = 30\) dollars.

Finally, we add up all the money:
- Total from milkshakes: $33
- Total from burger platters: $99
- Total from sodas: $30

"Melanie has been saving toothpicks for 12 weeks, and she saves 10 toothpicks each week. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The original price of the watch is $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500.

3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, we calculate:
   \[
   1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch for $1800.

4. Now, we need to find the discount percentage for Mr. Rogers' friend. The original price was $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800. The discount amount is:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
   The percentage discount is:
   \[

"Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas. So, the total number of bananas she gets is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

If she buys these bananas individually, each costing $0.80, the total cost would be:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

However, she buys the bananas in bunches, with each bunch costing $3.00. So, the total cost for 10 bunches is:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

The money she saves by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

"John has 8 classes each day, with each class being 40 minutes long. He goes to class 5 days a week, so the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

On the weekends, he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each day. So, the time spent on each day of the weekend is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say the triceratops had \( x \) kilograms of meat initially.
2. The T-Rex ate half of it, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were left.
3. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
4. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiply both sides by 4:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Now, we need to find out how many gallons of paint are needed. Since one gallon covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by 20:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon costs $12, the total cost is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

So, the cost to paint the room is:
\[
\boxed{144}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas, 3 of which are shaken.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 11 sodas in total, with 3 shaken and 8 unshaken.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda. There are 2 shaken sodas out of a total of 8 sodas.

The probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To convert this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) miles per hour.

Now, let's find out how far each train has traveled in 3 hours:

- The first train travels \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).
- The second train travels \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\).

To find the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we add the distances together:

\[180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\]

So, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Days Calculation:**
   - March has 31 days.
   - From March 1st to April 19th, we include all of March and the first 19 days of April.
   - So, total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

2. **Days Billy Works:**
   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.
   - 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
   - Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

3. **People Helped Calculation:**
   - Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
   - So, people helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
   - Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to know how many people the buses and cars could carry. However, the problem doesn't tell us exactly how many people were in each bus or car that went to the church. So, we can only calculate the maximum number of people that could have been transported.

Here's what we know:
- Each bus can carry 35 people, and there are 12 buses.
- Each car can carry 3 people, and there are 20 cars.

First, let's calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

So, the maximum number of people that could have been inside the church is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

So, Jeff is \(\boxed{30}\) years old."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet per minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet per minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

2 minutes"
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's add up the time for his breaks each day:
- 30 minutes for lunch
- 15 minutes for the first break
- 15 minutes for the second break

So, each day he spends:
\[ 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on his lunch and breaks.

Now, let's find out how much time he spends over 5 days:
\[ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. So, Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles.
3. The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles.

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then, we subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then, we subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]
6. Finally, we add the new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is \(\boxed{113.00}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. So, if the total number of jellyfish is \( J \), then the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

2. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

3. The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{J}{15} = 6
   \]

4. To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
   \[
   J = 6 \times 15 = 90
   \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

Therefore, Caroline is \(\boxed{24}\) years old."
"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual retirement expense:**
   Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $100,000.
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total retirement savings needed:**
   Lauren plans to live off this amount for 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000
   \]

3. **Determine the amount Lauren saves each year:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her current salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of years needed to save the total retirement amount:**
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
   \]

So, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement.

**Final Answer: 40 years**"
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts first. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:

\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long. Next, each of these 25-centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller parts, we divide 25 by 5:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to know the total number of students. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

Let's call the total number of students \( P \). Since 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can write the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. To find the number of girls, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

Let's start with the first step:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Now, let's move to the second step:
- There are 6 women in total.
- To find the average height, we divide the total height by the number of women: \(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches.

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much money the store will make from selling the red balls. There are 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9.
   \[
   3 \times 9 = 27
   \]
   So, the store will make $27 from the red balls.

2. Next, we calculate the money from the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5.
   \[
   11 \times 5 = 55
   \]
   So, the store will make $55 from the blue balls.

3. Then, we find out how much the store will make from the green balls. There are 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3.
   \[
   25 \times 3 = 75
   \]
   So, the store will make $75 from the green balls.

4. Finally, we add up all the money from the red, blue, and green balls to find the total amount the store will receive.
   \[
   27 + 55 + 75 = 157
   \]

So, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples is 12 kg. If Pierre and Paul take 7 kg, then the amount left for Jacques (or James) is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Anna started with a budget of $16.
2. She had already spent $4.
3. After buying 2 books today, she has $2 left.

First, we need to find out how much she spent in total:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]
So, she spent $14 in total.

Next, we know she had already spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the amount spent on the 2 books is:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]
So, she spent $10 on the 2 books.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.
2. Megan spent 2 hours longer than Amalia walking the dog, so Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior spent more than 4 hours longer than Amalia doing laundry, so Dior spent at least \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 8 hours, we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, let's add up the time spent by each person:
\[4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19\]

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"John visits his parents twice a month. Each visit involves a round trip that takes 2 hours at a speed of 70 miles per hour.

First, let's find the distance for one way:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it's a round trip, we need to double this distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

John visits his parents twice a month, so we multiply the round trip distance by 2:
\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 2 \times 280 \, \text{miles} = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
\[ \boxed{560} \]"

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Total Toys Needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys Still Needed**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys Already Produced**: \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Now, let's look at the workers:
- 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- Another 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first 4 workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first 4 workers is:
\[20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

So, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

To find out how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour, we divide the total production of the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour}\]

So, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[
\boxed{18}

1. Kris ended up with 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob. So, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all 16 stickers he had to Kris. Since Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris, he must have had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers originally.
3. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Since Luis had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers originally.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

The final answer is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"John buys 3 large bags of M&M, each weighing 10 ounces. So, the total weight is:

3 bags * 10 ounces/bag = 30 ounces

Since there are 30 M&M in an ounce, the total number of M&M he has is:

30 ounces * 30 M&M/ounce = 900 M&M

If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:

900 M&M / 10 M&M/bag = 90 small bags

So, the final answer is 90 small bags."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's call this number \( A \).
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs. Let's call the number of eggs Camden painted \( C \) and the number of eggs Sarah painted \( S \). So, \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. So, \( C = S + 12 \).

First, we can use the third piece of information to find out how many eggs Sarah painted:
\[ C = S + 12 \]
Since \( C + S = 30 \), we can substitute \( C \) in the equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now that we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, we can find out how many eggs Camden painted:
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, we know the total number of eggs painted is 56. So, we can write:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can simplify this to:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs. Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them into groups of 8 crayons each. To find out how many groups he can make, we divide 200 by 8:
\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]
So, Nik will have 25 groups of crayons.

Each group of crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Since there are 25 groups, Nik will need 25 boxes. The total weight of the boxes is:
\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together, we get:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight to pounds:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \text{ pounds} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Time on the Beach:**
   - Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The beach part of the trail is 2 miles long.

2. **Speed on the Beach:**
   - Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \).

3. **Speed on the Sidewalk:**
   - On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed of the beach, so her speed is \( 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \).

4. **Time on the Sidewalk:**
   - The sidewalk part of the trail is 1 mile long.
   - At a speed of \( \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \), the time to walk 1 mile is \( \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we multiply $4 by 8:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Her goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she saves each week:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug has an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( T \).

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Find out how many scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - So, \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Understand the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This means \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - So, for 1 scoop, you need \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop needs \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will need \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

So, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we calculate how many eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his intake to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs he eats in 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen):

1. We know the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
2. The total number of passengers is 84.

First, let's find out how many parts the total number of passengers is divided into. Since the ratio is 5:9, we add 5 and 9 to get 14 parts.

\[ 5 + 9 = 14 \]

This means the total number of passengers (84) is divided into 14 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide 84 by 14.

\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

So, each part is 6 passengers.

Next, we find the number of men and women:
- Number of men: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \)
- Number of women: \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \)

Faraday sells sunflowers and bouquets of sunflowers. Each sunflower costs $2, and each bouquet costs $8. He earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets each day. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.

First, let's find out how many individual sunflowers he sells each day:
- He earns $26 from individual sunflowers each day.
- Since each sunflower costs $2, the number of individual sunflowers sold each day is:
  \[
  \frac{26}{2} = 13
  \]

Next, let's find out how many bouquets he sells each day:
- He earns $56 from bouquets each day.
- Since each bouquet costs $8, the number of bouquets sold each day is:
  \[
  \frac{56}{8} = 7
  \]

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers are in the bouquets he sells each day:
- Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
- So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold each day is:
  \[
  7 \times 12 = 84

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
2. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters for $50.
3. After the first sale, he has 40 square meters left.
4. He then sells another 1/4 of the remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he sold 10 square meters for $30.
5. After the second sale, he has 30 square meters left.
6. He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter. So, he earns 30 * 3 = $90 from the final sale.
7. Adding up all the money he earned: $50 (first sale) + $30 (second sale) + $90 (final sale) = $170.

So, the total amount of money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[
\boxed{170}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Haley is 26 years old.
2. The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.
3. First, we need to find half of Haley's age:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]
4. Next, we subtract 10 from this result to find Geb's age:
   \[
   13 - 10 = 3
   \]

So, Geb is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we need to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days.

First, let's figure out how many face masks he uses in one day:
- He changes his mask 2 times per outing.
- He goes out 3 times a day.
So, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
\[ 2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days:
- He uses 6 face masks per day.
- We need to find out for 2 days.
So, the number of face masks he uses in 2 days is:
\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.
2. Lamar found 5 eggs.
3. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
4. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
5. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes each have 200 apartments.
   - Combined, they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than 400 apartments.
   - 60% of 400 is \(0.60 \times 400 = 240\).
   - So, the third complex has \(400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\).

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections = \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\).

4. **Calculate the total money made in a week:**
   - He gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Total money = \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{1248}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's say a 10-year-old tree produces \(x\) fruits. So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can say:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up the fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{1650}

"Jack originally had $100. Sophia gave him \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100. 

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of $100:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, add this to the $100 Jack originally had:
\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

\[
\boxed{120}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. If we let the length of the blue rope be \( B \), then the length of the red rope is \( 4B \).

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. If the length of the yellow rope is \( Y \), then \( B = Y - 7 \).

3. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]
   Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   4B + B + B + 7 = 37
   \]
   \[
   6B + 7 = 37
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   6B = 30
   \]
   Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   B = 5
   \]
   Now we know the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. To find the length of the red rope, we use \( R = 4B \):
   \[
   R = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa was given:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie.
   - So, Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Find out how much money Rissa gave to her little sister:**
   - After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money.
   - Let the amount given to the little sister be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - So, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5.
   - He gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The mural uses a total of 12 pints of paint. Half of the mural is yellow, so that's 6 pints of yellow paint. The remaining paint is used for red, white, and purple. That means the remaining paint is \(12 - 6 = 6\) pints. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the 6 pints by 3. So, each color gets \(6 \div 3 = 2\) pints.

Therefore, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

\[
\boxed{2}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find the area of one bedroom. Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so:
   \[
   20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
   \[
   4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:
   \[
   5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

5. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
   \[
   960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}
   \]

So, the total area of the house is:
\[
\boxed{3160}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
2. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box. So, we need to find out how many pods are in the special size box.

To find 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special size box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

3. The special size box costs $12 and has 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

4. Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, for $1, you can buy:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods} \]

Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."

   - After 5 days: \(1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since the chalk is less than 2 inches after 5 days, the teacher will have to recycle it.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. 

First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Now, let's add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. James has 30 teeth in total.
2. The dentist drills 4 of them.
3. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.
4. The total number of teeth fixed (drilled and capped) is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
5. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers, we get:
   \[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much Mr. Marcellus paid for the milk. He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000
   \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how much of the milk was sour. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk was sour, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. The refund is based on the cost of the sour milk. So, we calculate the refund as:
   \[
   \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600
   \]

So, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is \(\boxed{5600}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Wendy's current age is \( W \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

- Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
- In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

First, let's write these as equations:

1. Wendy's age is five times Colin's age in 7 years:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

2. In 25 years, Colin's age will be a third of Wendy's current age:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, let's solve these equations.

From the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange to solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To check:
- In 7 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \) years old.
- Wendy's age is \( 5 \times 27 = 135 \) years old.
- In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old.
- A third of Wendy's current age is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \).

Everything checks out. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27,000. We know that each set of 100 books costs $500. So, we divide $27,000 by $500:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

This means Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Since each set contains 100 books, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400
\]

Now, we need to divide these 5400 books equally among the 3 schools. So, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

Therefore, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
   - Newton now has 2 apples.

2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. He picked up these 5 apples.
   - Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
   - He picks up the 5 apples, so he now has 1 + 5 = 6 apples in total.

3. Newton put all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. He picked up all 6 of these apples.
   - Newton now has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground.
   - He picks up the 6 apples, so he now has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat in total.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, for 6 friends:
- Total cheese pizza slices = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Total pepperoni pizza slices = \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Next, we need to figure out how many whole pizza pies are required for these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Number of cheese pizza pies needed = \(\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}\)

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- Number of pepperoni pizza pies needed = \(\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}\)

So, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 5 miles each day for 2 days, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

Adding these together, Sam ran \(9 + 10 = 19\) miles this week.

So, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour. Since there are 4 fifteen-minute intervals in an hour, he builds 5 snowballs every 15 minutes (20 snowballs divided by 4 intervals).

However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. So, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \(5 - 2 = 3\) snowballs.

To find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate how many 15-minute intervals are needed. Since he gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we divide 60 by 3 to find the number of intervals:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ intervals} \]

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes into hours:

\[ \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Digimon is celebrating its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
2. John is currently 28 years old. So, 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
3. The problem states that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8 years old, Jim must have been half of that age, which is \(8 \div 2 = 4\) years old.
4. Since 20 years have passed since Digimon came out, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

So, Jim is now 24 years old."

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."

   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - At the end of the second day, they had \(12 - 28 = -16\). Since they can't have negative bandages, they ordered 50 more to cover the deficit.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - They ordered 2 packs, which is 100 bandages.
   - At the end of the third day, they had \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\) bandages.
   - But the problem states they had 78 bandages left. So, they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than 109.
   - Therefore, they started with \(109 - 31 = 78 - 31 = 34\) bandages.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

So, the final amount Jen will receive is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Emptying the Dishwasher**: Jason did this 6 times and earns $0.50 each time.
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]
   So, he earned $3.00 from emptying the dishwasher.

2. **Doing Laundry**: Jason did his laundry once and earns $3.00.
   \[
   1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]
   So, he earned $3.00 from doing laundry.

3. **Taking the Trash Out**: Jason took the trash out twice and earns $0.75 each time.
   \[
   2 \times 0.75 = 1.50

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
2. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, we calculate the amount of blood in one shark:
   \[
   40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by ten:
   \[
   120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:
\[
\boxed{1200}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
2. Each pack contains 5 pens.
3. So, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens}\).

4. She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
5. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is \(2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pens}\).

6. To find the total number of pens, we add the red pens and the black pens together.
7. So, the total number of pens is \(25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}\).

"John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600. This means each bottle of scotch costs:

\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 20 bottles. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of a bottle of scotch. So, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the 20 bottles of cognac is:

\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac together, we get:

\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends is:

\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees. He also planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up all the trees:
- Total White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
- Total Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

The problem states: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.""

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs as \( x \).

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

First, we need to isolate the term with \( x \). We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know there are 66 fish in total. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, we calculate one-third of 66:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

This means 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the 22 fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we know that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate \( \frac{5}{11} \) of 44:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

This means 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - So, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
```
19

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. His house is 7 times as tall as he is, so the height of the house is:
   \[
   60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. The height from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 3 times Mattison's height, so:
   \[
   60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. The total height of the house is the sum of the first floor height and the second floor height. Let's call the height of the second floor \( h \). So:
   \[
   180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
5. Solving for \( h \):
   \[
   h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is \(\boxed{240}\) inches."

   So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

2. This means the remaining shells are:
   \[
   700 - 280 = 420
   \]

3. Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   \[
   0.60 \times 420 = 252
   \]
   So, team The finders found 252 shells.

4. The remaining shells for team Gogetters are:

So, team Gogetters found \(\boxed{168}\) shells."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Bernie has 4 dogs and the average miles they need to walk per day is 3 miles. This means the total miles for all 4 dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."

- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

First, let's add up the weights of the tunas:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he will earn by selling these tunas. The price per kilogram of tuna is $0.50. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the buying price.

First, we need to find out the selling price:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
\]

To make it easier, we can simplify:
\[
72 \div 8 = 9
\]
So,
\[
9 \times 11 = 99
\]

The selling price is $99.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

So, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the low setting is \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the medium setting is \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the high setting is \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, let's add up the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

   The jar is a cube with a base of 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for packing jelly beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar:**

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people.
2. At the first stop, 40 more people get on the bus. So, the total number of people now is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on again. So, the number of people getting on at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30

   Adding these to the 60 people already on the bus, the total becomes:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So, the total number of people now is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the bus capacity:

1. **Initial Cost of One Visit**: The cost of one visit is $2.
2. **Increase in Cost**: After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. An increase of 150% means the cost is tripled (100% + 150% = 250% of the original cost).

   \[
   \text{New Cost} = 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Number of Visits**: Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - In 5 years, she visits:
     \[
     5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits}
     \]
   - In the next 3 years, she visits:

Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He makes a cut so he has two pieces. The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

Let's say the shorter piece is \(x\) feet long. Then the longer piece would be \(4x\) feet long.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[x + 4x = 40\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[5x = 40\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 5:
\[x = \frac{40}{5} = 8\]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece:
\[4 \times 8 = 32\]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To figure out how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning is needed for 80 meatballs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Find out how many meatballs come from one pound of ground beef:**
   - We know that 1 pound of ground beef makes 16 meatballs.

2. **Calculate how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs:**
   - If 1 pound makes 16 meatballs, then to make 80 meatballs, we need:
     \[
     \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Determine how much of the secret seasoning is needed for 5 pounds of ground beef:**
   - Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - So, for 5 pounds, he will need:
     \[
     5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]

Therefore, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. The problem states that she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. We need to find out how many cupcakes she made.

Let's say the number of cupcakes Carly makes is \( c \).

According to the problem, the number of brownies she makes is \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. So, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation:
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Next, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."

   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

So, the number of paintings Kim has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
   \[
   \text{Decrease} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this number is 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the number of novels she wrote this year. Let's call the number of novels she wrote this year \( x \).

So, we can write the equation:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

"Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week. Here's how we can figure out how much he spends in a year:

1. **Pasta Cost:**
   - Bud uses 1 box of pasta each week.
   - Each box of pasta costs $1.00.
   - So, the weekly cost for pasta is $1.00.

2. **Cheese Cost:**
   - He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese each week.
   - He spends twice that amount on gruyere cheese.
   - So, the cost for gruyere cheese is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars each week.

3. **Total Weekly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs: $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00 per week.

4. **Annual Cost:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

   - Convert this to a percentage: \( 0.5 \times 100\% = 50\% \).

So, on average, the custodian spends **50%** of their day cleaning classrooms."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's find out the total capacity of one bookcase:
- The middle 2 shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- Adding the bottom and top shelves, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Rose spent on the eggs. She bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many eggs she has. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's see how much she will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. So, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Out of these remaining hats, \( \frac{3}{5} \) are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

The rest of the hats are white. Therefore, the number of white hats is:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes in bags of 30 sticks and costs $18.00 per bag. There's a $3.00 discount, so the price per bag after the discount is:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Now, we need to find the cost per stick. Since one bag has 30 sticks and costs $15.00, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

To convert $0.50 to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them for a party. She makes some strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. The total number of ice cubes is 116.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Now, substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.
- The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. Since she has 20 plants in total, and 4 + 8 = 12 plants are already accounted for, the remaining plants are \(20 - 12 = 8\). So, \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) cups.

Adding all the water needed: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

So, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"Phineas Frog needs to travel 200 yards to get back home. Half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water. So, he needs to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes him to hop 100 yards, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
So, the time to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

In the water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To find out how long it takes him to swim 100 yards, we use the same formula:
\[ \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

To find the total time it takes Phineas to return home, we add the time spent on land and in water:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To find out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to figure out how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs and then calculate the total cost.

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. He needs 56 popsicle sticks, and each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. So, we divide 56 by 8:
   \[
   \frac{56}{8} = 7
   \]
   This means Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

2. Next, we need to find out the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, and Bob needs 7 boxes. So, we multiply 7 by $2.00:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"The main phone plan costs $20, and each additional phone costs half of that, which is $10. Since there are 4 additional phones, the total cost for the additional phones is 4 * $10 = $40. Adding the cost of the main phone, the total cost of the phone plan is $20 + $40 = $60.

So, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen is 12 doughnuts, we calculate:
   \[
   10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many doughnuts he makes in June. June has 30 days, so:
   \[
   120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts}
   \]

3. Finally, we need to find out how much money he makes by selling all these doughnuts. He sells each doughnut for $2, so:
   \[
   3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars}

"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were there than on the first day, so:
\[50 + 20 = 70\]

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number from the second day, so:
\[2 \times 70 = 140\]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, the total for these days is:
\[60 \times 4 = 240\]

Adding up all the people Conor saw:
\[50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480\]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Now, let's add all the popped kernels together:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much food the German Shepherds eat in a day. Since each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day and there are 3 German Shepherds, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
   \[
   5 \text{ kg/day/shepherd} \times 3 \text{ shepherds} = 15 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the daily food consumption for the Bulldogs. Each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day and there are 2 Bulldogs, so the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
   \[
   3 \text{ kg/day/dog} \times 2 \text{ dogs} = 6 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. Now, we add the daily consumption of both types of dogs to find the total daily food consumption:
   \[
   15 \text{ kg/day} + 6 \text{ kg/day} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

4. Finally, to find out how much food they need in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
   \[
   21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

So, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 10 animals that have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs from these animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.
2. We also have 15 animals that have 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs from these animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.
3. Adding these together, the total number of legs on the farm is \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.
4. Since we want to know the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2. So, \(80 \div 2 = 40\) pairs of legs.

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 blue blocks.
2. The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
3. Let's call the number of red blocks \(R\).
4. The total number of blocks is 32.

Now, we can write an equation to represent the total number of blocks:
\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides:
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

The final answer is:

1. **Red Candies**: There are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: The problem says there are twice as many orange candies as red candies. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: The problem states there are half as many yellow candies as red candies. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

So, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs during Nate's 14-day vacation. The dog digs 6 holes each day, so:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many holes are filled each day when Nate is home. Nate fills 9 holes each day, but the dog digs 6 holes each night, so the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to figure out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of oranges she can peel by dividing 60 by 3:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   So, Ana can peel 20 oranges in an hour.

2. Next, we need to find out how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour. Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange. Again, since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the number of oranges she can peel by dividing 60 by 4:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The radiator originally costs $400, but Mark gets it at 80% off. This means he only pays 20% of the original price.
2. To find out how much he pays for the radiator, we calculate 20% of $400:
   \[
   400 \times 0.20 = 80
   \]
   So, the radiator costs him $80.

3. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. So, the cost for labor is:
   \[
   50 \times 3 = 150
   \]
   Therefore, the labor costs $150.

4. To find the total amount Mark paid, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost:

So, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals, which are either chickens or cows. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 70.

Let's use some variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of animals: \( c + k = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To find \( k \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
