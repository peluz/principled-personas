"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs each day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. That means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell. She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 each day at the farmers' market.

The answer is $18."
"A robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber. Half of 2 is 1, so it needs 1 bolt of white fiber.

In total, it needs:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

So, the total bolts needed is 3."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Josh bought a house for $80,000.
2. He spent $50,000 on repairs.
3. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.

First, we need to find out how much the repairs increased the value of the house. To do this, we calculate 150% of $80,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much Josh spent in total:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

So, Josh made a profit of $70,000.

The answer is: \boxed{70000}"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session, he runs:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ meters} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \times 3 = 540 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Wendi has 20 chickens.
2. Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed a day.
3. So, the total feed for all chickens is \(20 \times 3 = 60\) cups a day.

Now, let's see how much feed Wendi has already given:
4. In the morning, she gives 15 cups.
5. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups.
6. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is \(15 + 25 = 40\) cups.

To find out how much more feed she needs to give:
7. We subtract the feed already given from the total feed needed: \(60 - 40 = 20\) cups.

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. One glass costs $5.
2. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. If we divide 16 by 2, we get 8 pairs of glasses.

For 8 pairs, the total cost is \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:**
$64"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - So, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - So, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - Now, we add up all the sheep.
   - Total sheep = Seattle's sheep + Charleston's sheep + Toulouse's sheep
   - Total sheep = \(20 + 80 + 160 = 260\)

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The file is 200 GB.
2. Carla can download 2 GB per minute.
3. At 40% of the file, that's 80 GB.
4. To download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute, it takes 40 minutes.
5. Then, Windows restarts for 20 minutes.
6. After the restart, she has to download the remaining 120 GB.
7. To download 120 GB at 2 GB per minute, it takes 60 minutes.

So, the total time is 40 minutes (first part) + 20 minutes (restart) + 60 minutes (second part) = 120 minutes.

The answer is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. That means he covers 180 miles (60 mph × 3 hours).

On his way back, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph, covering 15 miles (30 mph × 0.5 hours). After that, he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering 120 miles (80 mph × 1.5 hours).

So, the total distance he covers on his way back is 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

He was 180 miles away from home initially. After covering 135 miles on his way back, he is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles away from home.

So, the answer is 45 miles."
"Eliza works 40 hours at $10 per hour, so her regular pay is:
40 hours * $10/hour = $400

She worked 5 extra hours, which is overtime. Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular pay, so:
1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour for overtime

For the 5 overtime hours, she earns:
5 hours * $12/hour = $60

So, her total pay for the week is:
$400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460

The answer is $460."
"In the first month, the program got 60 downloads.

In the second month, it got three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads went down by 30%, so it kept 70% of the second month's downloads. That means:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total downloads over the three months, we add them all up:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"Toula bought some pastries from the bakery. She bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen. Let's calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Donuts:**
   - 3 dozen at $68 each.
   - Total cost for donuts = 3 × $68 = $204.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - 2 dozen at $80 each.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = 2 × $80 = $160.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - 6 dozen at $55 each.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = 6 × $55 = $330.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $204 (donuts) + $160 (mini cupcakes) + $330 (mini cheesecakes) = $694.

So, the total cost is $694."
"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money.

First, let's see how much money Carlos makes each year from selling lemons:
- He gets 7 lemons each year.
- He sells each lemon for $1.5.
- So, he makes $10.5 each year from selling lemons.

Next, we need to see how much it costs him each year to water and feed the tree:
- It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree.

Now, let's find out how much money he makes each year after paying for the water and food:
- He makes $10.5 each year from selling lemons.
- He spends $3 each year on water and food.
- So, he makes $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 each year after expenses.

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to earn back the $90 he spent on planting the tree:
- He needs to earn $90.
- He makes $7.5 each year.
- So, it will take $90 ÷ $7.5 = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house. So, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) at the orange house. After that, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.

The answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we have 20 students in total.
2. 20% of these students are in contemporary dance. So, we calculate 20% of 20:
   \[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \text{ students} \]
3. Now, we subtract the 4 students from the total to find out how many are left:
   \[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]
4. Of these 16 students, 25% are in jazz dance. So, we calculate 25% of 16:
   \[ 16 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \text{ students} \]
5. Now, we subtract the 4 students from the 16 to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:
   \[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]
6. To find out what percentage 12 students are of the total 20 students, we use:
   \[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - The jewelry is worth $5,000.
   - The market is expected to go up by 2.5%.
   - To find the new value, we calculate: \(5000 \times 1.025 = 5125\).
   - So, the new value of the jewelry is $5125.
   - The profit from jewelry is: \(5125 - 5000 = 125\).

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000.
   - The market is expected to go up by 1.2%.
   - To find the new value, we calculate: \(8000 \times 1.012 = 8096\).
   - So, the new value of the electronic gadgets is $8096.
   - The profit from electronic gadgets is: \(8096 - 8000 = 96\).

Comparing the profits:
- Jewelry profit: $125
- Electronic gadgets profit: $96

The merchant should buy the jewelry to make more profit.

**Final Answer:**
The maximum profit the merchant can achieve is $125."
"Each train travels 80 miles westward and then 150 miles northward over the two days.

To find the total distance each train travels, we add the two distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"Jill works 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach. She gets paid $20 per hour for teaching and $30 per hour for coaching. She works 50 weeks a year.

First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week and gets $20 per hour.
- So, she earns \(35 \times 20 = \$700\) per week from teaching.
- In a year, she works 50 weeks, so her annual earnings from teaching are \(700 \times 50 = \$35,000\).

Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week and gets $30 per hour.
- So, she earns \(15 \times 30 = \$450\) per week from coaching.
- In a year, she works 50 weeks, so her annual earnings from coaching are \(450 \times 50 = \$22,500\).

Now, let's add her annual earnings from both jobs:
- Her total annual salary is \(35,000 + 22,500 = \$57,500\).

So, Jill's annual salary is \(\$57,500\)."
"Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

In 4 weeks, she eats:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks is:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks."
"Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 more miles in another hour. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

First, let's find out how long it should take her to hike the whole 12 miles at 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

She has already spent 2 hours hiking, so the time left is:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The distance left to hike is:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use:
\[ \text{Required speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. You start with 10 liters of orange drink, and it's two-thirds water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. You spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so you have 9 liters left. The amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. You have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and it's three-fifths water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:

   6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink is \boxed{15} liters."
"Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31 years old, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, let's find out how old Raymond is now. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had his son when he was 23 years old. So, the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]

This means Raymond's son is currently:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract his current age from Samantha's current age:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, Raymond's son was born \(\boxed{2}\) years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to 8 customers on Tuesday. Let's count how many DVDs he sold:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, let's add them up:
3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. It melts 2 centimeters every hour. So, in 4 hours, it will melt:

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter."
"Sure, let's solve this together!

Kyle bought a book for $19.50 after getting a 25% discount. This means the $19.50 is 75% of the original price. To find the original price, we need to figure out what 100% would be.

If 75% of the original price is $19.50, then we can find 1% by dividing $19.50 by 75. 

\[ 1\% = \frac{19.50}{75} = 0.26 \]

Now, to find 100%, we multiply 0.26 by 100.

\[ 100\% = 0.26 \times 100 = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.

The answer is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Marie bought a chicken meal for $12.
2. She bought 5 packs of milk at $3 each, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. She bought 4 apples at $1.50 each, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:
\[12 + 15 + 6 = 33\] dollars.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[50 - 33 = 17\] dollars.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
\[\frac{17}{8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered \(\boxed{2}\) boxes of pizza."

"Henry went on a 60-mile bike trip. He stopped after riding 20 miles, and then he stopped again 15 miles before he finished his trip.

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to figure out how far he had left to go when he made his second stop.

First, we find out how far he had left to go after his first stop:
60 miles (total trip) - 20 miles (first stop) = 40 miles

Then, since he stopped 15 miles before the end, we subtract 15 miles from the 40 miles:
40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The answer is: 25 miles."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know one pair of high heels costs $33.
2. The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.
4. The problem says that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots. So, if we add $5 to the total cost of the high heels, we get the cost of the boots.
5. Therefore, the cost of the boots is \(99 + 5 = 104\) dollars.

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell is, Allen is 11 years.
2. Their total age now is 162 years. So, if we let Darrell's age be 7 parts and Allen's age be 11 parts, the total parts are 7 + 11 = 18 parts.
3. Each part is then \( \frac{162}{18} = 9 \) years.
4. Allen's age is 11 parts, so his current age is \( 11 \times 9 = 99 \) years.
5. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: \( 99 + 10 = 109 \) years.

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. To do that, we add them up and then divide by the number of guesses.

So, 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

There are 3 guesses, so we divide 240 by 3:

240 ÷ 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has 10 dogs.

3. So, for 10 dogs, the total time per day is:
   \[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]
4. There are 7 days in a week, so the total time per week is:
   \[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.
2. She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Then the number of gold coins would be \( S + 30 \).

So, the total number of coins can be written as:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Now, divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
\[ G = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 divided by 2, which is 20. So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.
3. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. He wants to know how much he spends on yogurt over 30 days when the yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00.

First, let's find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Next, we need to see how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost. Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:

"John sold his lego sets to buy video games. He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each. So, the total money he got is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then bought 8 video games for $20 each, which cost:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he had $5 left. So, the money he spent on video games and the leftover money is:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

The money he had left after selling the lego sets and buying the video games is:

\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set was sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day.

Let's find out how far he runs each day:
- On the first day, he runs 3 hours. If we call his speed \( v \) miles per hour, then he runs \( 3v \) miles.
- On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, so he runs for \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day. So, on each of these days, he runs \( 1.5v \) miles.

Now, let's add up all the miles he runs in a week:
- First day: \( 3v \) miles
- Second day: \( 1.5v \) miles
- Third day: \( 1.5v \) miles

So, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 3v + 1.5v + 1.5v = 6v \text{ miles} \]

We know he runs 60 miles a week, so:
\[ 6v = 60 \]
\[ v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step!

1. Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
2. Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so:
   \[ 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]
3. Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so:
   \[ \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, let's see how much time she spends running and walking in 6 hours:
- She runs for one-third of 6 hours:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
- She walks for two-thirds of 6 hours:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance she covers:
- Running distance:
   \[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
- Walking distance:
   \[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. So, Ben's iPhone is:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. So, Brandon's iPhone is:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. But when she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{200}\)"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

The answer is 26 pieces."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many calories are in one gram of chips. We know that a 300g bag has 1250 calories (5 servings * 250 calories per serving). So, 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories per gram.

2. Next, we need to see how many calories you can still eat. Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you have already eaten 1800 calories. So, 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

3. Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since 1 gram of chips has 4.17 calories, we divide 200 calories by 4.17 calories per gram. So, 200 / 4.17 ≈ 48 grams.

So, you can eat about 48 grams of chips."
"Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. He can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. He needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles. The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00, so for 2 pounds, it will be $20.00. He sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, he will get $40.00. 

To find out his net profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics. She writes 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she writes \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, she writes \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she writes twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's add up the articles she wrote each day:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 7 articles
- Wednesday: 14 articles

Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

Each article takes 4 hours to write. So, the total hours spent writing articles is:
26 articles \(\times\) 4 hours/article = 104 hours

The total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104."
"Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used some notes and had 23 left after using 220 notes at work. We need to find out how many notes were in the package she bought.

Let's break it down:
1. Candice had 80 notes initially.
2. She used 220 notes at work.
3. She had 23 notes left.

So, the notes she had after buying the package minus the 220 she used equals the 23 she had left. We can write this as:
\[ 80 + \text{notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for the notes in the package:
\[ 80 + \text{notes in the package} - 220 = 23 \]
\[ \text{notes in the package} - 140 = 23 \]
\[ \text{notes in the package} = 23 + 140 \]
\[ \text{notes in the package} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, let's find out how many blue ties he bought:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, the cost of each red tie is:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the total inches in 4 feet by multiplying:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces we can get from 48 inches. We do this by dividing 48 inches by 6 inches per piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

The final answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The building has 15 floors.
2. Each floor has 8 units.
3. So, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

Now, 3/4 of the building is occupied, which means:

4. The number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\).

To find the unoccupied units, we subtract the occupied units from the total units:

5. The number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Lloyd has chickens that produce 252 eggs every day. He sells these eggs at $2 per dozen. To find out how much he makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many dozens of eggs he has each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 252 by 12:
   \[
   252 \div 12 = 21 \text{ dozen}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate how much he makes each day by selling 21 dozen eggs at $2 per dozen:
   \[
   21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Finally, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
   \[
   42 \times 7 = 294 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. So, the distance he travels is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

On his way back, he travels at 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to travel 30 miles at 6 miles per hour, we use:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back."
"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. So, the weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys he needs to remove is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove \(\boxed{15}\) toys."
"On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Each truck tire costs $60 to repair, and each car tire costs $40 to repair.

For the truck tires on Thursday:
\[ 6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360 \]

For the car tires on Thursday:
\[ 4 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$160 \]

So, the total revenue on Thursday is:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. Each car tire costs $40 to repair.

For the car tires on Friday:
\[ 12 \text{ tires} \times \$40/\text{tire} = \$480 \]

So, the total revenue on Friday is:
\[ \$480 \]

To find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue, we subtract the lower revenue from the higher revenue:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

So, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The Doubtfire sisters have 7 adopted kittens.
2. Patchy, the first cat, has 3 times the number of adopted kittens. So, \(7 \times 3 = 21\) kittens from Patchy.
3. Trixie, the other cat, has 12 kittens.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Adopted kittens: 7
- Kittens from Patchy: 21
- Kittens from Trixie: 12

So, \(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\).

The total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is \(\boxed{40}\)."

"Sure, let's figure this out together!

Peter wants to go to the movies. Each time he goes, he spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn. So, each movie outing costs him $7 + $7 = $14.

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we need to see how many times $14 fits into $42.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times.

The answer is 3."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.
2. The truck and the driver together weigh 3755 pounds.
3. So, the remaining weight the truck can carry is:
   \[
   5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Each box weighs 15 pounds.
5. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:
   \[
   \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} = 83 \text{ boxes}
   \]

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is \(\boxed{83}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Stephen's initial bill for groceries is $40.00.
2. The delivery company adds a 25% fee on the $40.00. To find 25% of $40.00, we can do:
   \[ 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]
3. Now, we add this 25% fee to the initial bill:
   \[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]
4. The delivery company also charges $3.00 for delivery:
   \[ 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]
5. Stephen adds a $4.00 tip:
   \[ 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"Sure, let's count the raspberries together!

First, we have 6 clusters of raspberries, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we multiply 6 by 20:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]
This means there are 120 raspberries in the clusters.

Next, we have 67 individual raspberries scattered around.

Now, we add the raspberries from the clusters and the individual raspberries:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

So, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ \boxed{187} \]"
"Okay, let's count the oranges step by step:

- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25 is 5 (because 20% means 20 out of 100, so 20 out of 100 is 0.20, and 0.20 times 25 is 5)
- Sour oranges: 2

Now, let's subtract the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:

25 (total) - 1 (bad) - 5 (unripe) - 2 (sour) = 17

So, the number of good oranges is 17.

The answer is 17."

"Aleena pays $140 every month for a streaming service. For the first half of the year, she pays this amount for 6 months. So, the total for the first half is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half of the year, the company charges 10% less. So, the new amount per month is:
\[ 140 - (140 \times 0.10) = 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half, she pays this new amount for 6 months. So, the total for the second half is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount she paid by the end of the year, we add the amounts from both halves:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank of gas, we need to know how many miles her car can go with one gallon of gas. We know that with 4 gallons of gas, she drove 100 miles. So, we can find out how many miles she can drive with one gallon by dividing 100 miles by 4 gallons:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know her car can go 25 miles for each gallon of gas. Since her tank can hold 12 gallons of gas, we can find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank by multiplying 25 miles per gallon by 12 gallons:

\[ 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."
"Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So each time, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on both activities.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know there are 175 diamonds.
2. There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from 175 to find the number of rubies:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. There are twice as many emeralds as rubies. So, we multiply the number of rubies by 2:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280
   \]
   So, there are 280 emeralds.
4. Now, we add up all the gems:
   \[
   175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 595
   \]

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 595.

The final answer is: \boxed{595}"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know there are 60 girls at the school.
2. The number of boys is twice the number of girls, so we calculate:

"Shiela bought five cell phones, each costing $150. So, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \]

There is a 2% interest on each cell phone. So, the interest for one cell phone is:

\[ 150 \times 0.02 = 3 \]

Since there are five cell phones, the total interest is:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela will pay is:

\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \]

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, so each month she will pay:

First, we need to round the prices of the flowers to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2

Next, we calculate how much Artie makes from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: 12 pots × $3 = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots × $2 = $18
- Begonias: 17 pots × $2 = $34

Now, we add up all the money:
$36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The top level of the sandcastle has 16 square feet.
2. The next level down has half of 16, which is 8 square feet.
3. The next level down has half of 8, which is 4 square feet.
4. The bottom level has half of 4, which is 2 square feet.

Now, let's add up all the square feet:
16 (top level) + 8 (second level) + 4 (third level) + 2 (bottom level) = 30 square feet

Since there are 4 levels, we divide the total square feet by 4 to find the average:
30 ÷ 4 = 7.5

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5.

The answer is: \boxed{7.5}"
"Cecilia's puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. That means for 180 days, the puppy will need 180 cups of dog food.

One bag of dog food has 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia needs, we divide the total cups needed by the number of cups in a bag:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 1.636 \text{ bags} \]

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she needs to round up to the next whole number. So, she needs 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds.
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, if Sarah does 400 pounds, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds.
4. Now, we need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. Raymond does 200 pounds and David does 100 pounds. So, the difference is \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."
"Vincent can buy flowers in two ways:
- Packages of 3 flowers for $2.50
- Packages of 2 flowers for $1.00

To buy 18 flowers, let's see which way is cheaper.

If he buys in packages of 3:
- He needs 6 packages (18 ÷ 3 = 6)
- Total cost is $15.00 (6 × $2.50 = $15.00)

If he buys in packages of 2:
- He needs 9 packages (18 ÷ 2 = 9)
- Total cost is $9.00 (9 × $1.00 = $9.00)

The cheaper way is to buy in packages of 2. So, he saves:
- $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

The money Vincent saves is $6.00."
"John takes his dog to the groomer, which costs $100. The groomer gives him a 30% discount because he is a new customer. 

First, we need to find out how much the discount is. We do this by taking 30% of $100:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original cost to find the final cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the grooming cost after the discount is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters} \]
   Since there are two girls, they together got:
   \[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

2. The boy got 6 liters of water.

3. Now, we add the water the girls and the boy got:
   \[ 8 + 6 = 14 \text{ liters} \]

4. We started with 24 liters, so the water left is:
   \[ 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water left is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Charlie started with 10 stickers. Then he bought 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. For his birthday, he got 23 more, making it 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. He gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers left. He used 28 stickers to make a card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.

The final number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

First, we find out how much 4 times Grace's weight is:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Then, we subtract 2 pounds to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \]

So, Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together to find their combined weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \]

Their combined weights are 623 pounds."

1. Dan plants 3 rose bushes.
2. Each rose bush has 25 roses.
3. Each rose has 8 thorns.

First, we need to find out how many roses Dan has in total:
\[ 3 \text{ rose bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we need to find out how many thorns there are in total:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

So, the total number of thorns is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this together!

The football team played 22 games in total. We know they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's use some simple math to find out how many games they won.

First, let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \). Then the number of games they won would be \( L + 8 \).

We know the total number of games is 22, so we can write:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:
\[ W = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"

11 years × 4 vacations per year = 44 quilt blocks

So, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is 44."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first alarm rang 4 times.
2. The second alarm rang for three times as long as the first one, so it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third alarm rang for half as long as the second one, so it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's add them up:
\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sylvie starts with a monthly salary of $600.
2. After 5 years, her salary increases by 10%. So, her new monthly salary is:
   \[
   600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Now, her annual salary is:
   \[
   660 \times 12 = 7920 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. After another 3 years, her salary increases by 10% each year. Let's calculate it:
   - After the 6th year:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Let's say Harald sold \( H \) copies of his record.
2. Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so she sold \( 10H \) copies.
3. Together, they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can write the equation: \( H + 10H = 88,000 \).
4. Combining the terms on the left side, we get \( 11H = 88,000 \).
5. To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11: \( H = \frac{88,000}{11} \).
6. When we do the division, we get \( H = 8,000 \).

So, Harald sold \(\boxed{8000}\) copies."
"Christina is planning a birthday party. She invited 16 friends, but she knows that 1 out of every 4 friends might not come. So, 3 out of every 4 friends will come. 

To find out how many friends will come, we do:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Christina wants to give 0.75 gift bags to each friend who comes. So, for 12 friends, she needs:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

There are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 child dinosaurs at the picnic.

For the adults:
20 dinosaurs × 10 pounds = 200 pounds

For the children:
5 dinosaurs × 5 pounds = 25 pounds

To find the total amount of potato salad needed:
200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is: 225 pounds."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cindy's pets: 4
- Marcia's pets: 6
- Jan's pets: 18

So, the total number of pets is \(4 + 6 + 18 = 28\).

The total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know James is 10 years old and he is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 11 years old.
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
3. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
3. So, Gerald's original time was 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.
4. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means he can now run 90% of his original time.
5. To find 90% of 40 seconds, we calculate: \(40 \times 0.90 = 36\) seconds.

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in \(\boxed{36}\) seconds."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know there are 60 dogs.
2. For every dog, there are 2 cats. So, if there are 60 dogs, then there are \(60 \times 2 = 120\) cats.
3. Now, we add the number of dogs and cats together: \(60 + 120 = 180\).
4. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).
5. To find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The answer is: \(\boxed{348}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many boys there are. We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 200 students are boys. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
   \]
   So, there are 80 boys.

2. Now, we need to find out how many girls there are. Since the total number of students is 200 and there are 80 boys, the number of girls is:
   \[
   200 - 80 = 120
   \]
   So, there are 120 girls.

3. Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
   \]
   So, 80 girls are in the girl scout.

4. Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
   \[
   120 - 80 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 girls are not in the girl scout.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces.
2. When Freda makes sauce, the volume of tomatoes is halved. So, 16 ounces of tomatoes become 8 ounces of sauce.
3. Freda made 32 ounces of sauce. To find out how many cans she used, we divide 32 by 8:
   \[
   \frac{32}{8} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]
4. Each can has 3 tomatoes. So, to find out how many tomatoes she used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We start with 30 cars on the motorway. During the traffic jam, some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes, and then 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes. Also, 5 cars take an exit and don't have to drive through the traffic jam.

So, if we take away the 5 cars that took an exit, we have:
30 cars - 5 cars = 25 cars

These 25 cars are the ones that actually drove through the traffic jam. We know that 20 cars drove through in the second 15 minutes, so the rest must have driven through in the first 15 minutes. 

To find out how many cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, we subtract the 20 cars from the 25 cars:
25 cars - 20 cars = 5 cars

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary got 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. She already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, she had 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants before.

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. That means she will give away 1 * 40 = 40 potted plants.

After giving away 40 potted plants, she will have 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants left.

But then, she gets 18 more potted plants. So, she will have 40 + 18 = 58 potted plants in total.

The final number of potted plants Mary will have is 58.

So, the answer is: 58."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, we need to add 1/4 of 20 to 20:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, we need to add 10 to 60:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]
   So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 70 times.

Now, let's add all the doorbell rings together:
\[
20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 175."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Solo needs to read:
   - 4 pages from his Science textbook
   - 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook
   - 7 pages from his History textbook
   - 8 pages from his Geography textbook

2. Total pages to read = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

3. Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so the remaining pages are:
   39 - 15 = 24 pages

4. Solo has 4 more days to read the remaining pages. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
   24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. Now, the city is 42 miles wide.

First, we need to find out how many 3-mile sections are in 42 miles. We do this by dividing 42 by 3:
\[ 42 \div 3 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 sections of 3 miles in 42 miles.

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover each section:
\[ 14 \times 10 = 140 \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

The answer is \(\boxed{140}\) minutes."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Poppy starts with 1000 pieces.
2. She places a quarter of them on the board. A quarter means 1 out of 4, so:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]
   So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

3. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left:
   \[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]
   So, 750 pieces are left.

4. Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. A third means 1 out of 3, so:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]
   So, her mom places 250 pieces.

5. Now, we need to find out how many pieces are left after her mom places her pieces:
   \[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]
   So, 500 pieces are left to be placed.

The final number of pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\)."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find the inner dimensions of one box. The walls are 1 inch thick, so we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box.

- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Now, we calculate the volume of one box using these inner dimensions:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

John has 3 boxes, so we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"

Frankie watches TV after doing his homework. Here's how much he watched each day:
- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each day, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours because he got to stay up late.

Now, let's add up what we know:
- Monday and Tuesday: 2 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

So, 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours.

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours. So, the time he watched on Wednesday is:
7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours.

Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours. So, to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday, we divide 1.5 by 0.5:
1.5 ÷ 0.5 = 3.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"Henry is making cookies for a baking competition. He wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. But he ended up making 15 more cookies than he planned. After that, he dropped 5 cookies and now has 110 cookies.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. If Henry now has 110 cookies after dropping 5, he must have had 115 cookies before dropping them.
2. He made 15 more cookies than he planned, so before making those extra 15, he had 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.
3. He wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so last year he made 100 / 2 = 50 cookies.

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without any cashback. Since gas costs $3.00 per gallon, for 10 gallons, it would be:
   \[ 10 \times 3 = \$30.00 \]

2. Next, calculate the cashback. The app gives $0.20 cashback per gallon. For 10 gallons, the cashback would be:
   \[ 10 \times 0.20 = \$2.00 \]

3. Now, subtract the cashback from the total cost to find out how much you have to pay:
   \[ 30 - 2 = \$28.00 \]

So, after the cashback, the gas will cost:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate. Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, we multiply 2 by 24:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
So, Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups.

Next, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, we multiply 3 by 14:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]
So, Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups both of them ate:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]
So, together they ate 90 fruit roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2 (since there are two of them):
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Julia's boat had a problem while she was on the lake. For every 10 feet she rowed, 2 liters of water came into the boat. It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, and the shore was 64 seconds away.

First, let's find out how far Julia needs to row to reach the shore:
- If 16 seconds is for 20 feet, then 64 seconds is for:
  \[
  \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much water came into the boat for 80 feet:
- For every 10 feet, 2 liters of water come in. So for 80 feet:
  \[
  \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters}
  \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore. The answer is:

The final number of flowers that grew is 25."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - So, if we divide 1800 by 6, we get the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - \( 1800 \div 6 = 300 \)
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

3. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - If Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, then the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \( 300 \div 50 \).
   - \( 300 \div 50 = 6 \)

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sasha bought some lumber and the price went up by 50%. She has 10 boards that cost $10 each and 5 boards that cost $16 each. She wants to sell them all.

First, let's find out how much she paid for all the boards:
- For the 10 boards at $10 each: 10 * $10 = $100
- For the 5 boards at $16 each: 5 * $16 = $80
- Total cost: $100 + $80 = $180

Now, let's find out how much she can sell them for:
- The new price for the 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each
- The new price for the 5 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each
- Total selling price for the 10 boards: 10 * $15 = $150
- Total selling price for the 5 boards: 5 * $24 = $120
- Total selling price: $150 + $120 = $270

To find out how much profit she makes, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90

So, Sasha makes a profit of $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, she uses 13 parts of water. The total parts used are 7 + 13 = 20 parts. She used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water combined.

To find out how much one part is, we divide 120 by 20:
\[ \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since the sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 6 by 7 to find out how much sugar she used:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:
\[ 42 \]"
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Each pair of shoes costs $60. To find out how much he paid, we need to do some simple math.

First, we find out how many pairs of shoes John bought in total:
2 pairs/child × 3 children = 6 pairs

Next, we calculate the total cost:
6 pairs × $60/pair = $360

So, John paid $360."
"On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles in each container. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day was \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary was \( L \), then:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
   \]

4. Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92
   \]

5. The total salary the two were receiving four years later is:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
   \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper each week. Each pad has 30 sheets. So, in one week, he uses:

\[2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}\]

Since there are about 4 weeks in a month, the number of sheets he uses every month is:

\[60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}\]

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges as Morisette.

So, Kael brought:
- \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's count the total number of fruits:
- Morisette's total: \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits
- Kael's total: \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits

Adding these together:
- Total fruits: \(13 + 14 = 27\)

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   Sadie slept 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday:**
   She slept 2 hours less than Monday each day.
   So, on Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours each day}
   \]
   For two days, the total is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:**
   She slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   So, on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she slept:
   \[
   6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours each day}
   \]
   For four days, the total is:
   \[
   7 \times 4 = 28 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total sleep for the week:**
   Adding up all the hours:
   \[
   8 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday and Wednesday)} + 28 \text{ (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday)} = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, Sadie slept a total of 48 hours throughout the week."
"Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, in 3 hours, she runs:
10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

After that, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours. So, in 4 hours, she runs:
5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles.

To find the total distance she runs in 7 hours, we add the two distances together:
30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.

The answer is 50 miles."
"Jennie is helping at her mom's office. She has 60 letters that need stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters. One-third of 60 is 20. So, she put stamps on 20 letters. Now, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before she added the 20 letters, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters already in the pile.

So, the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began was 10.

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Julia bought a package of spoons for her dinner party. Her husband gave her another package with 5 spoons. She used 3 spoons to taste the stew. After setting the table, she had 12 spoons.

Let's think about it step by step:
1. Julia's husband gave her 5 spoons.
2. She used 3 spoons, so she had \(5 - 3 = 2\) spoons from her husband left.
3. She had a total of 12 spoons after setting the table. This means the spoons she bought plus the 2 spoons from her husband equal 12.

So, if we let \(x\) be the number of spoons Julia bought, then:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \(x\), we subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

The answer is: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages and 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. So, he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. 

To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the chicken sausages and fish sausages together: 38 + 44 = 82.

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know Lily made 50 friends.
2. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so we add 20 to the number of friends Lily has:
   \[ 50 + 20 = 70 \]
   So, Amy made 70 friends.
3. Now, to find out how many friends they have together, we add the number of friends Amy has to the number of friends Lily has:
   \[ 50 + 70 = 120 \]

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for what Dillon needs to buy:

- Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the cost is \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- Dillon buys 20 peppers, so the cost is \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the cost is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Adding these up, the total cost is \(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(880\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Time Spent:**
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Each person takes 24 minutes.
   - So, \(500 \times 24 = 12000\) minutes.
   - Convert minutes to hours: \(12000 \div 60 = 200\) hours.

2. **Doctors' Charge:**
   - Doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - So, \(200 \times 150 = 30000\) dollars.

3. **Patients' Charge:**
   - Patients charge $200 per hour.
   - So, \(200 \times 200 = 40000\) dollars.

4. **Total Revenue:**
   - Total revenue from doctors and patients: \(30000 + 40000 = 70000\) dollars.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost is the doctors' charge: \(30000\) dollars.

6. **Profit:**
   - Profit is total revenue minus total cost: \(70000 - 30000 = 40000\) dollars.

So, the hospital's profit is **$40,000**."
"Nissa starts with 60 elves. Then, a third of them quit because kids vomited on them. So, we need to find a third of 60:

\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

This means 20 elves quit. So, the number of elves left is:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Then, 10 more elves quit because kids kicked their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves left:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than in May, so he spent $500 - $60 = $440. To find out how much he spent in total for both months, we add the amounts together: $500 + $440 = $940.

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times. Then, each of them rode the luge 2 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets.

First, let's count the roller coaster rides:
- Pam: 2 rides
- Fred: 4 rides
- Total roller coaster rides: 2 + 4 = 6 rides

Next, let's count the luge rides:
- Pam: 2 rides
- Fred: 2 rides
- Total luge rides: 2 + 2 = 4 rides

Now, let's find the total number of rides:
- Total rides: 6 (roller coaster) + 4 (luge) = 10 rides

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:
- Total tickets: 10 rides × 6 tickets/ride = 60 tickets

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is 60."
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as on Monday, so he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles. The total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total miles. So, \(41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\).

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

**13**"
"Tom washes his car 4 times a month, and each wash costs $15. To find out how much he pays in a year, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how much he pays each month:
\[ 4 \text{ washes} \times \$15 \text{ per wash} = \$60 \text{ per month} \]

Now, there are 12 months in a year, so we need to multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ \$60 \text{ per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = \$720 \text{ per year} \]

So, Tom pays \(\boxed{720}\) dollars in a year for car washes."
"Brian originally has 20 video games but loses 5, so he has:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate:

2. One third of these unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we need to find one third of 27:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]
   So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.
3. Two thirds of these 9 unicorns are female. So, we need to find two thirds of 9:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

The final answer is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Rory orders 2 subs at $7.50 each:
   - \(2 \times 7.50 = 15.00\)

2. Rory orders 2 bags of chips at $1.50 each:
   - \(2 \times 1.50 = 3.00\)

3. Rory orders 2 cookies at $1.00 each:
   - \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)

4. Now, add all these together:
   - \(15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00\)

5. Rory has to pay a 20% delivery fee on the total cost:
   - \(20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00\)

6. Add the delivery fee to the total cost:
   - \(20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00\)

7. Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip:
   - \(24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00\)

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\)."
"Mark took two tests. In the first test, he had 75 questions and completed 5 questions every hour. He had 8 hours to finish the test. So, in 8 hours, he completed:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]
The test had 75 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

In the second test, he had 100 questions and 6 hours to finish. He completed 5 questions every hour, so in 6 hours, he completed:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]
The test had 100 questions, so the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

The problem says there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. We know there are 12 blue gumballs.

First, we need to find four times the number of blue gumballs:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Next, we add 22 to this number to find the number of pink gumballs:
\[ 48 + 22 = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70.

The final answer is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

We know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these:
- 12 are automatic cars
- 4 are manual cars

To find out how many are semi-automatic, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

The final answer is:
20%"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know there are 700 bees in total.
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's use some simple numbers to understand this better:
- Let's say there are \( Q \) queens.
- Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, there are \( 2Q \) baby bees.
- Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \) worker bees.

Now, we know the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

To find \( Q \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens. Now we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
- Baby bees: \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
- Worker bees: \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \)

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. He could earn money if he worked instead. He earns $10 for each hour of work. 

First, let's find out how many hours he plays video games in one week:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, let's calculate how much money he would earn if he worked those 14 hours:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

So, Jordan would earn \(\$140\) in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

The answer is: \(\$140\)."
"John buys different things and we need to find out how much everything costs, including a little extra for some things.

- Milk costs $2
- Eggs cost $3
- Light bulbs cost $3
- Cups cost $3
- Roach traps cost $4

First, we add up the cost of the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps because these are not food items. So, we have:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to add 10% tax to these non-food items. To find 10% of $10, we do:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost for the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we add the cost of the food items (milk and eggs):
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the food items and the non-food items together:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Kim has a housekeeping business. He has 3 clients already and is talking to 5 more potential clients. So, the total number of clients will be:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for each client is:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles} \times \$2 = \$4 \]
\[ 1 \text{ pack} \times \$5 = \$5 \]
So, the total cost for each client is:
\[ \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Since Kim will have 8 clients, the total cost for all clients will be:
\[ 8 \times \$9 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

So, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"John has a pineapple field that covers 10 hectares. In each hectare, there are 100 pineapples. He can harvest these pineapples every 3 months. We need to find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a year.

First, let's find out how many pineapples are in the whole field:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

John can harvest these pineapples 4 times in a year because there are 12 months in a year and he harvests every 3 months:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

Now, let's find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests} = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.
2. Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if Dorothy has \(D\) friends, then \(3D = 12\).
3. To find out how many friends Dorothy has, we divide 12 by 3:
   \[D = \frac{12}{3} = 4\]
   So, Dorothy has 4 friends.
4. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Since Dorothy has 4 friends, James has:
   \[4 \times 4 = 16\]
   So, James has 16 friends.

Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is 16."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

First, we need to change the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve lives 3 miles away, and 1 mile is 5280 feet. So, 3 miles is \(3 \times 5280 = 15840\) feet.
- Tim lives 2 miles away, so 2 miles is \(2 \times 5280 = 10560\) feet.

Next, we calculate how long it takes for each of them to get home:
- Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute. So, the time it takes for Steve is \(15840 \div 440 = 36\) minutes.
- Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. So, the time it takes for Tim is \(10560 \div 264 = 40\) minutes.

Now, we find the difference in time:
- Tim takes 40 minutes and Steve takes 36 minutes. So, the difference is \(40 - 36 = 4\) minutes.

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Shawnda is helping kids in her neighborhood with their bike tires. She charges 25 cents for each tire.

- 5 people came with bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires. So, \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires. So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- 1 person came with a unicycle, and a unicycle has 1 tire. So, \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Now, let's add all the tires together:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500\] cents.

To find out how many dollars that is, we divide by 100:
\[500 \div 100 = 5\] dollars.

So, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. A seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants took the last fry, leaving 5 fries.

Now, let's work backwards:

- After the ants took the last fry, there were 5 fries left. So, before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon took two-thirds, the raccoon left one-third, which is 6 fries. So, before the raccoon, there were \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"Sure, let's figure out how many hours Kimo spends in classes in one semester.

First, let's look at how many hours he spends in classes each week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes, each 1 hour long. So, that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours each of those days. Since there are 3 such days, it's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes, each 2 hours long. So, that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours each of those days. Since there are 2 such days, it's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add the hours from both parts of the week:
- \(9\) hours from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- \(8\) hours from Tuesday and Thursday.

So, in one week, Kimo spends \(9 + 8 = 17\) hours in classes.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, we multiply the weekly hours by 16:
- \(17 \times 16 = 272\) hours.

So, Kimo spends 272 hours in classes in one semester.

The answer is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Rolls**: Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long.
   - So, the total length of rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - So, the total length of croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes**: Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - So, the total length of baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, let's add up all the lengths in inches:
- Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

Finally, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. Since 1 foot = 12 inches:
- Total length in feet = \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"Sure, let's figure out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas every month.
   - For 2 months, they need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas every month.
   - For 2 months, they need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas every month.
   - For 2 months, they need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, let's add up all the bananas needed for 2 months:
- Monkeys: 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 800 bananas
- Baboons: 200 bananas

Total bananas needed = \(400 + 800 + 200 = 1400\) bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how far Blake runs. The football field is 100 yards long, and Blake runs back and forth 15 times. So, he runs:
\[ 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, let's see how far Kelly runs. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so she runs:
\[ 80 \text{ yards} \times 2 \times 34 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly. We do this by subtracting the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 \text{ yards} - 2720 \text{ yards} = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. The answer is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Raphael bought some school supplies. He bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, 2 notebooks at $4 each, and a rim of bond paper for $20. Let's calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Pens:**
   - 4 pens at $1.5 each.
   - Total cost for pens = 4 × $1.5 = $6.

2. **Notebooks:**
   - 2 notebooks at $4 each.
   - Total cost for notebooks = 2 × $4 = $8.

3. **Bond Paper:**
   - 1 rim of bond paper at $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = $20.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
- Total cost = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34.

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything.

The final answer is: \boxed{34}"
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, so now he sees \(11 + 6 = 17\) tadpoles. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so he can now see \(17 - 2 = 15\) tadpoles.

The final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15."
"On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, it has 7 feet more, so the depth is:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \]"
"Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. That's a total of:
\[ 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \]

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish} \]

That's a total of:
\[ 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \]

So, the total number of fish they caught together is:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months.
3. We need to find the price after 36 months.

First, let's see how many times the price increases in 36 months:
- 36 months ÷ 2 months = 18 times

Now, each time the price increases by 20%, it means the new price is 120% of the old price. We can write 120% as 1.20.

So, the price after each increase is:
- New price = Old price × 1.20

We need to do this 18 times. We can use a simple formula for this:
- New price = Original price × (1.20)^number of increases

Plugging in the numbers:
- New price = 20 × (1.20)^18

Using a calculator to find (1.20)^18:
- (1.20)^18 ≈ 39.366

Now, multiply this by the original price:
- New price = 20 × 39.366 ≈ 787.32

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32.

The final answer is \boxed{787.32}."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We have 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
   - So, the total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = \$20\).

2. We have 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = \$15\).

3. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure costs $5, the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = \$15\).

4. Now, we add up the costs of all the toys:
   - Red cars: \$20
   - Action figures: \$15
   - Doll: \$15
   - Total: \(20 + 15 + 15 = \$50\)

So, the total worth of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Each hour of freelance work she loses means she loses $35. So, for 3 hours, she will lose \(3 \times 35 = 105\) dollars.

"Elvira bought a computer and some accessories. The computer costs €1090, and she also bought a screen for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Let's add up all the costs:

- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these together:

1. €1090 + €157 = €1247
2. €1247 + €74 = €1321
3. €1321 + €102 = €1423

So, the total cost is €1423. Elvira has a budget of €1500. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost from her budget:

€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The answer is: €77."
"Sandra needs eggs to make Spanish flans for a school fundraiser. Each flan needs 3 eggs, and she wants to make 15 flans. So, she needs:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Her neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times she needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, Seth is \( 2B \) years old.
2. In 2 years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old and Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old.
3. The problem says that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can write the equation:
   \[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]
4. Simplify the left side:
   \[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
   \[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
5. Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[ 3B = 24 \]
6. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[ B = 8 \]
7. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is:
   \[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Sure, let's count the legs step by step!

1. **Spiders:**
   - There are 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - So, \(80 \times 8 = 640\) legs from spiders.

2. **Insects:**
   - There are 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - So, \(90 \times 6 = 540\) legs from insects.

3. **Rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each has 10 legs.
   - So, \(3 \times 10 = 30\) legs from these.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Legs from spiders: 640
- Legs from insects: 540
- Legs from rare mutant invertebrates: 30

"Jessica needs to pay money each month for different things. Here's how much she needs to pay each month:

- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

First, we add these up to find the total minimum she needs to pay each month:
$300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this minimum. So, we need to find 50% of $1000 and add it to $1000:
50% of $1000 = $500
$1000 + $500 = $1500

This means Jessica pays $1500 each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply $1500 by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Cost of lemons and sugar per gallon:**
   - Lemons cost $3
   - Sugar costs $2
   - Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5

2. **Revenue from selling lemonade:**
   - They sell each glass for $0.50
   - They get 20 glasses per gallon
   - Revenue per gallon = 20 glasses * $0.50/glass = $10

3. **Profit per gallon:**
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5

4. **Number of gallons sold to make $25 in profit:**
   - Total profit = $25
   - Number of gallons sold = Total profit / Profit per gallon
   - Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

**Faster Team:**
Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are 4 runners, the total time is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
- The first runner takes 60 seconds.
- The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so he takes:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
- The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so he takes:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
- The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so he takes:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, add up the times for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The faster team takes 220 seconds, and the less well-rounded team takes 212 seconds. So, the difference is:
\[ 220 \text{ seconds} - 212 \text{ seconds} = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"Sure, let's break it down into simple steps!

1. **Rolling a Number Greater Than 3:**
   - A six-sided die has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
   - The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   - So, there are 3 chances out of 6 to roll a number greater than 3.
   - The chance is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.

2. **Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row:**
   - The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - So, there are 3 chances out of 6 to roll an even number.
   - The chance of rolling an even number is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50%.
   - Since the rolls are independent, the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%.

3. **Comparing the Chances:**
   - The chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%.
   - The chance of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.
   - To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we compare the two chances.
   - 50% is 2 times 25%, so it is 200% more likely.

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{200}\)"

4. So, the straw given to the rats is \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.
5. Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the number of rats is \(90 \div 6 = 15\).
6. These 15 rats are kept in 3 cages, so the number of rats per cage is \(15 \div 3 = 5\).

So, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Mandy owes Benedict $100.
2. Every month, the amount she owes increases by 2%.

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
- Total amount after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is $106.12.

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{106.12}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. The trader buys each bag of wheat for $20.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag to the warehouse.
3. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
4. The trader sells each bag for $30.
5. The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags.

Now, let's find out how many bags the trader sold.

- The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $30 - $22 = $8.
- The total profit is $400, so the number of bags sold is $400 ÷ $8 = 50.

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

The answer is: \boxed{50}"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The friends spent $20.25 on tickets.
2. They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets, so:
   \[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]
   So, they spent $15.75 on food.
3. They went on 2 rides, and each ride cost $33, so:
   \[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]
   So, they spent $66 on rides.
4. Now, let's add up all the costs:
   \[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]
   So, the total cost is $102.
5. Since there are 3 friends, they will split the cost evenly:
   \[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]
   So, each friend pays $34.

The answer is: \boxed{34}"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects each week.
2. There are 10 ducks in the flock.
3. So, for 10 ducks, the total amount of insects needed per week is:
   \[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]
4. There are 7 days in a week, so to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide the weekly total by 7:
   \[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Tom plants 10 trees each year and chops down 2 trees each year. So, he gains 8 trees each year (10 - 2 = 8).

He starts with 50 trees. Over 10 years, he gains 80 trees (8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees).

So, after 10 years, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

But then, 30% of the trees die. 30% of 130 trees is 39 trees (0.30 * 130 = 39).

So, he loses 39 trees. Therefore, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

The final number of trees Tom has left is 91.

**Answer: 91**"
"On Friday, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard. On Saturday, the neighbors took 6 pink flamingos and painted them white. So, now there are 12 pink flamingos and 6 white ones. On Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos. Now, there are 30 pink flamingos and 6 white ones. 

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white ones, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 

30 - 6 = 24

So, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

**Answer: 24**"
"Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors. Each crayon costs $2. She has $20 to spend.

First, we need to find out how much 5 crayons will cost. Since each crayon is $2, we multiply 5 by $2:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]
So, 5 crayons will cost $10.

Next, we need to find out how much change Violetta will get. She has $20 and the crayons cost $10, so we subtract $10 from $20:
\[ 20 - 10 = 10 \]
So, Violetta will get $10 in change.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. A pencil costs $1.20.
2. An eraser costs $0.30.
3. A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

So, to find the cost of one pen, we add the cost of the pencil and the eraser:
\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means one pen costs $1.50.

Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

The final answer is:

1. We have 200 pounds of carrots.
2. There are 40 restaurants.
3. Each restaurant is to get 2 pounds of carrots.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots will be given to all the restaurants:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the amount given to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

We know the total number of people in Soda is 23,786. Out of these, 8,417 are men and 9,092 are women. To find out how many children there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total number of people.

So, we do:
23,786 (total people) - 8,417 (men) - 9,092 (women)

Let's do the math:
23,786 - 8,417 = 15,369
15,369 - 9,092 = 6,277

So, there are 6,277 children in Soda.

The final answer is: 6277"
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times that number. So, she collected \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month. So, she collected \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months. The combined number of cards from the first and second months is \(60 + 40 = 100\). So, she collected \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

Now, let's add up all the cards:
- Initial cards: 20
- First month: 60
- Second month: 40
- Third month: 200

So, the total number of cards Elaine has now is \(20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. He edits an equal number for two publishers, so he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. So for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, Mark earns:
\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.

"Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. Each pail has 5 liters of water.

First, let's find out how many pails he gets in a day:
- Morning: 5 pails
- Afternoon: 6 pails
- Total pails per day: 5 + 6 = 11 pails

Now, each pail has 5 liters of water. So, we need to find out how many liters are in 11 pails:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl had a sandwich every day for lunch.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - So, for sandwiches, he used \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices of cheese.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl had an omelet for breakfast 3 days a week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - So, for omelets, he used \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices of cheese.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Sandwiches: 14 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and Cheese: 8 slices

So, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(14 + 9 + 8 = 31\).

"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know the total score she needs for an average of 93 over 6 tests. Since the average is the total score divided by the number of tests, we multiply 93 by 6:
   \[
   93 \times 6 = 558
   \]
   So, she needs a total of 558 points.

2. Next, we add up the scores of the first five tests:
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]
   So, she has 438 points from the first five tests.

3. To find out what score she needs on the sixth test, we subtract the total score she has from the score she needs:
   \[
   558 - 438 = 120
   \]
   But wait! She can remove the lowest score from the first five tests. The lowest score is 71. So, we subtract 71 from 438:
   \[
   438 - 71 = 367
   \]
   Now, we need to find out what score she needs on the sixth test to make the total 558:
   \[
   558 - 367 = 191
   \]

So, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{191}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."

\[ 5 \times 25 \times 4 = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

Then, for the next 3 weeks, he rode 2 times a week, but each time he rode 60 kilometers. So, for the second part, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 60 \times 3 = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

Now, we add the two parts together to get the total distance:
\[ 500 + 360 = 860 \text{ kilometers} \]

So, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
2. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. So, each candied apple weighs half of 40g, which is 20g.

Now, let's find the total weight of the chocolate bars:
- There are 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40g.
- So, the total weight of chocolate bars is \(25 \times 40 = 1000\) grams.

Next, let's find the total weight of the candied apples:
- There are 80 candied apples, and each weighs 20g.
- So, the total weight of candied apples is \(80 \times 20 = 1600\) grams.

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
- Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
- Total weight = 1000g + 1600g = 2600g

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{2600}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times as many cakes as she did on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, let's add up all the cakes she bought:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

So, the total number of cakes is \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know that half a dozen plates cost $6000.
2. The problem says that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
3. So, we subtract $1200 from $6000 to find the cost of twenty dozen cups:
   \[
   6000 - 1200 = 4800
   \]
   So, twenty dozen cups cost $4800.
4. Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups are 240 cups (because 20 dozen = 20 * 12 = 240), we divide $4800 by 240:
   \[
   4800 \div 240 = 20
   \]
   So, each cup costs $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"Sara wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes that cost $20 each. So, the total cost for the shoes is 2 times $20, which is $40. Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns 4 times $5 = $20 from babysitting. She also has $10 saved already.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we add what she has and what she earns from babysitting: $10 + $20 = $30. She needs $70 in total, so she needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40, we divide $40 by $4: $40 ÷ $4 = 10.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The answer is: \boxed{10}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that red chickens give 3 eggs each day and white chickens give 5 eggs each day.
2. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
3. He has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say the number of red chickens is \( r \). Then the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

The total eggs from red chickens is \( 3r \) and from white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).

So, the total eggs collected is:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Gary likes to walk around the edge of a park. The park is a rectangle that is 1.5 miles long and 6 miles wide. To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to know the perimeter of the park and how fast Gary walks.

First, let's find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we plug in the values:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, we plug in the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.

On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.

By the third day, the total number of customers was 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know both pools are losing water at 4 gallons per minute.
2. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's use some simple math:

- If the small pool has \( S \) gallons now, then 4 minutes ago it had \( S + 16 \) gallons (because it lost 4 gallons each minute for 4 minutes).
- The big pool now has \( B \) gallons, and 4 minutes ago it had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

From the problem:
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
  \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
  \[ B = 4S \]

Now, let's solve these:
- Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
  \[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
  \[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
  \[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
  \[ 2S = 16 \]
  \[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes that cost $320.00 and a belt that costs $32.00. First, we need to find out how much money she needs in total. 

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

So, Lori needs $352.00 to buy both the shoes and the belt. Her job pays her $8.00 for every hour she works. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total amount of money she needs by her hourly wage.

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn enough money to buy the shoes and the belt.

The answer is: \(\boxed{44}\)"
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to give back 10% more. First, we find 10% of $2000:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]
So, the total amount she needs to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is paying $165 each month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find out how much she will have left to pay, we subtract the amount she paid from the total amount she needs to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, let's find out their ages in three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

So, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 ÷ 2 = 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
4. The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, we need to find out how many points Jojo scored. We do this by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.

Let's do the subtraction:
251 - 68 (Naomi's points) - 44 (Yuri's points) - 85 (Brianna's points) = 54

So, Jojo scored 54 points.

The answer is \(\boxed{54}\)."

90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"The company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spend one-third of $15,000, which is $5,000. So, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is:

$15,000 (first year) + $5,000 (second year) = $20,000

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000."
"Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour, and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours, and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.

First, let's find out how much Carlos pays:
- Carlos pays $30 for each hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- So, Carlos pays \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much Benji pays:
- Benji pays $18 for each hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- So, Benji pays \(18 \times 5 = 90\) dollars.

Now, let's add the amounts they both pay:
- Carlos pays 90 dollars.
- Benji pays 90 dollars.
- So, together they pay \(90 + 90 = 180\) dollars.

The total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is 180 dollars."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, Andrew needs 6 days. 

To travel back from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it takes him half the time, which is 3 days.

So, if Andrew goes by bus to Rochester and returns by car, he will travel for a total of 6 + 3 = 9 days.

The answer is 9 days."
"James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards. He loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 more grass type cards.

First, let's find out how many water type cards he has now:
40 - 8 = 32 water type cards

Next, let's find out how many grass type cards he has now:
20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards

Now, let's add up all the cards he has:
30 fire type + 34 grass type + 32 water type = 96 cards in total

To find the chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiply by 100 to get a percentage:
(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest whole number, we get 33.

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Sure, let's figure out how much Chad owes for his lunch step by step.

1. The base burrito costs $6.50.
2. Extra meat costs $2.00.
3. Extra cheese costs $1.00.
4. Avocado costs $1.00.
5. Two sauces cost $0.25 each, so that's $0.50 in total.
6. Upgrading for chips and a drink costs $3.00.

Now, let's add all these costs together:

\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a $5.00 gift card, so we subtract this from the total:

\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, Chad still owes \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"Kalinda and her mom are working on a 360-piece puzzle. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take them to finish the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can place together per minute: 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The farm started with 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready and taken home by Ashlyn.
3. Now, we subtract the 36 watermelons from the total to find out how many are left:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
5. Now, we subtract the 63 watermelons that were harvested from the 84 that were left:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000.
   - So, the total cost of the cars is \(12 \times 20,000 = 240,000\).

2. He has to pay 10% tax on the cars.
   - 10% of $240,000 is \(0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000\).

3. He also has to pay $1,000 for registration on each car.
   - So, the total registration cost is \(12 \times 1,000 = 12,000\).

4. Now, we add up all the costs:
   - Total cost of cars: $240,000
   - Tax: $24,000
   - Registration: $12,000
   - So, the total amount he pays is \(240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000\).

The final amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[
\boxed{276000}

"On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected:

\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells} \]

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, she collected:

\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \text{ shells} \]

So, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 50 ants in the garden.
2. The number of bugs is half the number of ants. So, we divide the number of ants by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
3. Now, to find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and bugs together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75
   \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"There are 36 penguins sunbathing. One-third of them, which is 12 penguins, jump into the ocean. Another one-third, also 12 penguins, go into the cave to eat. So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins are not sunbathing anymore. 

To find out how many are still sunbathing, we subtract the 24 penguins from the original 36:
36 - 24 = 12

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day. In a week, they eat 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

The answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices of pizza.
2. So, the total number of slices needed is \(20 \times 4 = 80\) slices.
3. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
4. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza: \(80 \div 8 = 10\).

So, John needs to order \(\boxed{10}\) pizzas."
"Ram bought 25 pens. When he uses 5 pens, he can make 1 new pen. 

First, he uses 25 pens and makes:
\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens} \]

So now he has:
\[ 25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \text{ pens} \]

Next, he uses 5 pens again and makes:
\[ \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen} \]

So now he has:
\[ 5 - 5 + 1 = 1 \text{ pen} \]

He can't make any more pens because he needs 5 pens to make 1 new pen. 

So, the total number of pens Ram has is:
\[ 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}

"Jessa is 20 years old. Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. To find the sum of their ages, we add them together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68.

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know there were 1000 students in the hall.
2. After the meeting, 30% of the students went out through exit A. So, we calculate 30% of 1000:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.
3. Now, we subtract the 300 students who went out through exit A from the total number of students:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students are left.
4. Next, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B. So, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 700:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.
5. Now, we subtract the 420 students who went out through exit B from the remaining 700 students:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]
   So, 280 students went out through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. John has 54 candies.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert. So, if Robert has \( R \) candies, then \( 2R = 54 \).
3. Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \). So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has \( 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.
5. Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies. So, the difference is \( 54 - 33 = 21 \).

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is:

"Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book. If they both read each other's books as well as their own, we need to count all the books they read.

- Dolly reads her 2 books and Pandora's 1 book, so Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads her 1 book and Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads 3 books.

To find the total number of books read, we add the books read by Dolly and Pandora together: \(3 + 3 = 6\).

So, the total number of books they collectively read is 6.

Final answer:
\[
6

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mike had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.
2. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. So, Mike receives \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters a week.
3. Mike also sends 6 letters a week in response.
4. Each letter is 5 pages long. So, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.
5. Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. So, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.
6. There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

He also used 300 extra minutes for other calls. So, the total minutes he used is:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

His phone plan gives him 1000 minutes, so the minutes left are:

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, we know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. So, the difference in the number of snails is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem says that this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. If we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours each day.
3. So, each day she charges: $250 * 6 = $1500.
4. She needs to do this 4 times a week.
5. So, each week she charges: $1500 * 4 = $6000.
6. The movie lasts 5 weeks.
7. So, for 5 weeks, she charges: $6000 * 5 = $30000.
8. After the movie, she gives a 10% discount.
9. 10% of $30000 is: $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.
10. So, the final amount after the discount is: $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

So, Jean paid \(\boxed{27000}\)."

"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's add up the cookies:
- Sue's sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies in total.
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies in total.

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, the total calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The difference in calories is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, let's figure out how many cougars Rick killed today:
- He killed 15 cougars last night.
- Today, he killed 3 fewer cougars, so \(15 - 3 = 12\) cougars.

Now, let's find out how many wolves he killed today:
- He killed three times as many wolves as cougars today.
- Since he killed 12 cougars today, he killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves today.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)
- Cougars: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

"Sure, let's figure out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank.

1. **Pennies**: Brady has 100 pennies. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, he has $1 from pennies.
2. **Nickels**: He has 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 40 nickels are worth 40 * 5 = 200 cents. Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, 200 cents make 2 dollars.
3. **Dimes**: Brady has 20 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents. Again, 200 cents make 2 dollars.
4. **Dollar bills**: He has 40 dollar bills. Each dollar bill is worth $1, so 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, let's add it all up:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Andrea's Apples:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.

2. **Jamal's Apples:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - So, Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

3. **Jamal's Bananas:**
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Since Jamal has 44 apples, he has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

4. **Andrea's Bananas:**
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - So, Andrea has \(\frac{48}{2} = 24\) bananas.

5. **Total Fruits:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so she has \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
   - Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so he has \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.
   - The total number of fruits is \(76 + 92 = 168\).

So, the total number of fruits is \(\boxed{168}\)."

\[ 9300 \div 3 = 3100 \]

Now, multiply 3100 by 2:
\[ 3100 \times 2 = 6200 \]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies.

Next, we need to convert 6,200 pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100:
\[ 6200 \div 100 = 62 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:
\[ \boxed{62} \]"
"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each. So, she has \(5 \times 50 = 250\) marbles from the boxes. Then she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles she has now is \(250 + 20 = 270\).

The answer is 270."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has, so:
   \[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
   Ferdinand has 3 trees.
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, so:
   \[ 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]
   Harry has 11 trees.
4. To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract:
   \[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175. To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add up their money:

Carmen: $100
Samantha: $125
Daisy: $175

So, $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

The total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is $400."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The house costs $350,000.
2. There's a brokerage fee of 5% of $350,000. That means:
   \[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]
3. There's also a transfer fee of 12% of $350,000. That means:
   \[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]
4. So, the total extra cost is:
   \[ 17,500 + 42,000 = 59,500 \]
5. Adding this to the house price:
   \[ 350,000 + 59,500 = 409,500 \]
6. Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. So, the extra amount is:
   \[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The answer is \boxed{9500}."
"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and also paid back a part of his loan.

1. **Transfer Fees**: He paid 3% of $400,000 as transfer fees.
   \[
   3\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]
   So, the transfer fees are $12,000.

2. **Brokerage Fee**: He paid 5% of $400,000 as a brokerage fee.
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]
   So, the brokerage fee is $20,000.

3. **Total Deductions**: He had to pay $12,000 for transfer fees and $20,000 for brokerage fee.
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]
   So, the total deductions are $32,000.

4. **Remaining Loan Amount**: He also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

5. **Net Proceeds**: To find out how much Mr. Tan got after all these, we subtract the total deductions and the remaining loan amount from the selling price.
   \[
   400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000.

**Answer: $118,000**"
"To find out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to add up the time it takes to heat the oil to different temperatures and the time to cook the chicken.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat to 400 degrees.
   - So, the time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Add up all the times: \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

So, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much the real estate agent spent on newspaper ads. He spent $5 on each ad and bought 50 ads.
   - So, \(5 \times 50 = 250\) dollars.

2. Next, we need to find out how much he spent on television ads. He spent $75 on each ad and bought 15 ads.
   - So, \(75 \times 15 = 1125\) dollars.

3. Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total amount spent.
   - \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

So, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on buying all the ads."
"The juggler has 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so we divide 16 by 2 to find the number of golf balls:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]
So, there are 8 golf balls. Now, half of these golf balls are blue, so we divide 8 by 2 to find the number of blue golf balls:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]
Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, let's add them up:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. So, in one house, the number of bedroom windows is \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).
5. Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

6. Each house also has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.
7. So, the total number of additional windows in 2 houses is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

8. Now, to find the total number of windows, we add the bedroom windows and the additional windows together:
   \(12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

So, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Sure, let's figure out how much change the mother gets back.

First, we need to add up the cost of the things she bought:
- Cocoa costs $4.20
- Laundry costs $9.45
- Pasta costs $1.35

Adding these together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother paid with $20. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from what she paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes 1/10 of the body's stitches, so:
   \[
   \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]
4. Now, add the stitches for the collar and rosette:
   \[
   \text{Total collar and rosette stitches} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]
5. The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so subtract the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette to find the stitches for the sleeves:
   \[
   \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 900 - 270 = 630
   \]
6. Since there are two sleeves, divide the total sleeve stitches by 2:
   \[
   \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on the tomato seeds. She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, we multiply 20 by $40:
\[ 20 \times 40 = 800 \]
So, she spent $800 on tomato seeds.

Next, we need to find out how much she spent on the celery seeds. She bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, we multiply 80 by $30:
\[ 80 \times 30 = 2400 \]
So, she spent $2400 on celery seeds.

Now, we add the money spent on tomato seeds and celery seeds to find the total amount spent:
\[ 800 + 2400 = 3200 \]

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song.
   - So, \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has 6 more lines than the song.
   - So, \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - So, \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.

4. **Total Lines:**
   - Adding up all the lines:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Carly started with 80 cards.
2. She had 2/5 of the cards with the letter A. So, \( \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \) cards had the letter A.
3. That means \( 80 - 32 = 48 \) cards were left.
4. Then, 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \) cards had the letter B.
5. Now, \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) cards were left.
6. 5/8 of the rest had the letter C. So, \( \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \) cards had the letter C.
7. Finally, the rest of the cards had the letter D. So, \( 24 - 15 = 9 \) cards had the letter D.

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is \( \boxed{9} \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole. So, for 30 small holes, it will take:
   \[
   30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole. So, for 15 large holes, it will take:
   \[
   15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Now, we add the time for both small and large holes:
   \[
   90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. To convert 240 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

**Answer: 4 hours**"
"Sure, let's think about this together!

Mico and Marco are two friends who want to know each other better. We know that right now, the total of their ages is 20 years.

Now, imagine that both Mico and Marco grow up a bit more. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. So, that means their ages will each increase by 10 years.

If we think about it, when each of them is 10 years older, the total extra years added to their ages will be 10 (for Mico) plus 10 (for Marco), which makes 20 extra years in total.

So, if we add these 20 extra years to their current total age of 20, we get:

20 (current total age) + 20 (extra years) = 30

Therefore, in 10 years, the sum of their ages will be 30.

The answer is: 30."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if Sam is \( S \) years old, then Ruby is \( 6S \) years old.

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \) years old, and Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old.

3. The problem says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

4. Now, let's solve this equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]

5. Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]

6. Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   3S = 18
   \]

7. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   S = 6
   \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{6}\)."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. A cobra has 70 spots.
2. A mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, so a mamba has \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.
3. There are 40 cobras, so the total spots for cobras are \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \).
4. There are 60 mambas, so the total spots for mambas are \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \).
5. The total spots for all cobras and mambas combined is \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \).
6. Half of 4900 is \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \).

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, let's find out how much money she has in total:
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Now, add the value of the quarters and dimes together:
\[125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents}\]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, subtract the cost of the pop from her total:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many stars are in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.
   - For the 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
   - For the 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.
   - So, the total number of stars in these rows is \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars.

2. Now, we know the flag has 76 stars in total. So, we need to find out how many stars are left for the 5-star rows.
   - Stars left for 5-star rows: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars.

3. To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the remaining stars by 5.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars:
   \[
   8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

2. Next, we need to see how many chocolate bars the adults will get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars:
   \[
   4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

3. Now, we subtract the chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
   \[
   40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

4. Finally, we need to share these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:

"Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a break for half an hour. So, she works for 2.5 hours in total.

First, we need to find out how many minutes she works. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we calculate:
2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. To find out how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes, we divide:
150 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 15 intervals

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Mike has 21 points.
2. Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
3. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, let's see if they get an extra point in the fourth round:
- Mike has 21 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. His total is now \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not more than 20, so he does not get an extra point. His total stays at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is more than 20, so he gets an extra point. His total is now \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Finally, let's add up all their points:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

So, the total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

The total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:

1. Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
2. There are 5 people in the family, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner.
3. So, each meal, the family eats 5 people * 0.2 kg/person = 1 kg of rice.
4. Since they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), the family eats 1 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 2 kg of rice per day.
5. There are 7 days in a week, so the family eats 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg of rice per week.
6. We have a 42 kg bag of rice. To find out how many weeks it will last, we divide the total rice by the weekly consumption: 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"Sam has a goal to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. But he was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates.

Let's add up the crates he sold:
- Weekend: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, let's add these numbers:
20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's goal was 120 crates, but he only sold 65 crates. To find out how many crates he was short, we subtract:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

So, Sam was short by 55 crates from his goal.

The answer is: \boxed{55}"
"Carmen starts by bidding $200. Each time someone else bids, the price goes up by $50. There are 3 other people bidding, so Carmen bids 4 times in total.

1. First bid: $200
2. Second bid: $200 + $50 = $250
3. Third bid: $250 + $50 = $300
4. Fourth bid: $300 + $50 = $350

Now, we add all the bids together:
$200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100

So, the desk costs Carmen $1100. The answer is \boxed{1100}."
"John hires a driving service to get to work. His work is 30 miles away, and he goes there and back each day. So, he drives 60 miles each day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back).

He works 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year. So, the total miles he drives in a year is:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15000 \text{ miles/year} \]

He is charged $2 per mile. So, the cost for the miles driven in a year is:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

He also gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the total amount he pays annually for the driving service is:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ 31800 \]"
"On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes. On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. To find out how many minutes he needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first add the minutes from Monday and Sunday:

23 + 16 = 39 minutes

Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Monday and Sunday combined. So we multiply 39 by 2:

39 × 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter has to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday. The answer is 78 minutes."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, we need to figure out how many pieces of paper are used. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, makes 4 pages. So, we need to divide the total number of pages by 4.

"Annika brought $50 to the town fair. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is $25. Then she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, she spent a total of $25 + $10 = $35. 

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the money she brought:

$50 - $35 = $15

So, the amount of money left is $15.

The answer is: $15"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise has 250 books in total.
2. She has 50 books left unsold.
3. So, she sold \(250 - 50 = 200\) books in total.
4. This year, she sold 45 books.
5. Last year, she sold twice as many as this year, so \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books.
6. To find out how many books she sold the year before last, we subtract the books sold in the first and this year from the total sold: \(200 - 90 - 45 = 65\) books.
7. Each book sells for $20.
8. So, the money she earned last year is \(65 \times 20 = 1300\) dollars.

The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"Watson works 10 hours each day for 5 days a week. He earns $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:

\[ 10 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100 \]

For 5 days, his weekly earnings are:

\[ \$100 \times 5 = \$500 \]

If the company performs well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly earnings with the bonus are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800 \]

April usually has 4 weeks. So, his total earnings for April are:

\[ \$800 \times 4 = \$3200 \]

So, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."
"John arm wrestles 20 people. He beats 80% of them. 

First, we need to find out how many people he beat. To do this, we take 80% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he arm wrestled 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The answer is: 4"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. In the morning, two-thirds of the loaves are sold. So, we need to find two-thirds of 60:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After selling 40 loaves in the morning, the bakery has:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves left}
   \]
4. In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold. So, we need to find half of 20:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
5. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10.

So, the answer is:

"Sure, let's figure this out together!

Helena has a special juice that makes people grow extra arms and legs. Every 3 days, a person grows an extra arm, and every 5 days, they grow an extra leg. We want to know how many new arms and legs a person will grow after 15 days.

First, let's count the extra arms:
- In 15 days, if we divide 15 by 3, we get 5. So, a person will grow 5 extra arms.

Next, let's count the extra legs:
- In 15 days, if we divide 15 by 5, we get 3. So, a person will grow 3 extra legs.

Now, let's add the extra arms and legs together:
- Extra arms: 5
- Extra legs: 3
- Total new limbs: 5 + 3 = 8

So, after 15 days, a person will grow 8 new limbs.

**Final Answer:**

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each:
   \[ 6 \times 100 = 600 \]
   So, he spends $600 on suits.

2. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each:
   \[ 3 \times 50 = 150 \]
   So, he spends $150 on suitcases.

3. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. A business suit costs $100, so:
   \[ 5 \times 100 = 500 \]
   Adding $700 to this:
   \[ 500 + 700 = 1200 \]
   So, the flight ticket costs $1200.

4. Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the total he can spend is:
   \[ 6000 - 2000 = 4000 \]

5. Now, let's add up the costs of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
   \[ 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \]

6. The amount left for buying gifts is:
   \[ 4000 - 1950 = 1950 \]

So, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the family, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day. So, \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}\).
2. The rest of the family, which is 2 people, eat 2 eggs each day. So, \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}\).
3. The total number of eggs the family eats each day is \(9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}\).
4. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs the family eats in a week is \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\).

So, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we subtract 3 from 30:
   \[
   30 - 3 = 27
   \]
   So, Jane is 27 years old.
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to 27:
   \[
   27 + 5 = 32
   \]
   So, Trent is 32 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Cera's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - So, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - So, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - The population six years ago was half of what it is now.
   - So, the current population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).
2. The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's \( 2D \).
3. The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's \( \frac{D}{2} \).

Now, we know the total number of players is 105. So, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 2D + 4D + D = 210 \]

Now, add up the terms on the left side:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Martha invited some families to her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. So, the total number of people invited is:

- For the 2 families with 6 people: \(2 \times 6 = 12\)
- For the 3 families with 4 people: \(3 \times 4 = 12\)

Adding these together, \(12 + 12 = 24\) people were invited.

But some people couldn't come. 8 people couldn't come because they were sick, and 2 more people couldn't come because they had other plans. So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people came to the party, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\(24 - 10 = 14\)

So, the number of people who came to Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. The store already had 50 marbles. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles.

So, the total number of marbles Solomon has is:
20 (bought from Johanna) + 50 (already in the store) + 8 (from his father) = 78 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
78 marbles * 2 kgs/marble = 156 kgs.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs.

Answer: 156 kgs"
"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

   \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 30 boys in the classroom.
2. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys. So, we calculate:
   \[
   30 \times 3 = 90
   \]
   So, there are 90 girls.
3. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{30}{10} = 3
   \]
   So, there are 3 nongendered children.
4. To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
2. We are given that there are 45 electric wires.
3. Since the ratio is 1:3, we can set up a simple equation to find the number of poles. If 3 wires correspond to 1 pole, then 45 wires will correspond to \( \frac{45}{3} \) poles.
4. Calculating \( \frac{45}{3} \) gives us 15.

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The answer is: 15"
"At the start, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 10 people left because 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 30 people stayed. If 22 men stayed, then the number of women who stayed is \(30 - 22 = 8\).

So, the number of women left at the party is 8.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. Jam has 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together make 26 pencils.
2. If we take away the 2 loose pencils, we have 24 pencils in the 3 boxes.
3. So, each box has \(24 \div 3 = 8\) pencils.
4. Now, Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have \(26 + 46 = 72\) pencils.
5. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we need \(72 \div 8 = 9\) boxes to store all the pencils.

"Shannon makes iced coffee by adding ice cubes and cream. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. She wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and adds 15 milliliters of cream.

First, we need to find out how many ice cubes she needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
\[ \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Next, we calculate how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes:
\[ 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters} \]

Then, we add the weakening effect of the cream:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

So, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The company has 100 people working there.
2. Junior programmers make up \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total employees. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \text{ junior programmers}
   \]
3. The rest are senior programmers:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ senior programmers}
   \]
4. Each junior programmer gets $2000 per month. So, the total for junior programmers is:
   \[
   40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]
5. Senior programmers get $400 more than junior programmers, so they get:
   \[
   2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
   \]
6. The total for senior programmers is:
   \[
   60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]
7. Adding both totals together gives us the total amount the company pays:
   \[
   80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( x \).
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So now there are \( x + 5 \) people on the bus.
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So the number of people on the bus now is \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 \).
4. Simplifying that, we get \( x + 6 \) people on the bus.
5. We know that at the third bus stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So, \( x + 6 = 20 \).
6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation: \( x = 20 - 6 \).
7. So, \( x = 14 \).

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]

Then he gives 14 to his friends, so he has:
\[ 22 - 14 = 8 \]

He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \]

Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left:
\[ 8 + 28 = 36 \]

That night, he eats 3 more lollipops, so he has:
\[ 36 - 3 = 33 \]

In the morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, so he has:
\[ 33 - 2 = 31 \]

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To fully charge the phone, it needs to go from 60% to 100%, which is 40 percentage points.

The phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, for 40 percentage points, it will take:

\[ 40 \text{ points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To change minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mom gives her 10 more, so she has:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Last Shopping Trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they get $1 off the next purchase.
   - So, $80 ÷ $20 = 4.
   - This means they get $4 off their next purchase.

2. **This Shopping Trip:**
   - The customer spent $43.
   - They used the $4 reward from the last trip.
   - They also used a coupon that took twice the reward amount off the price.
   - Twice the reward amount is 2 × $4 = $8.
   - So, the total amount taken off is $4 (reward) + $8 (coupon) = $12.

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - The customer spent $43 and got $12 off.
   - So, $43 - $12 = $31.

"Nick is choosing between two jobs. 

For Job A:
- He gets $15 per hour.
- He works 2000 hours a year.
- There's a 20% tax on his pay.

So, his yearly pay is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
The tax is 20% of $30,000, which is 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000.
So, his net pay is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B:
- He gets $42,000 a year.
- There's a $6,000 property tax.
- There's a 10% tax on the remaining pay after property tax.

After property tax, he has $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
The tax on $36,000 is 10% of $36,000, which is 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600.
So, his net pay is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. To find 40 percent of 220, we do:
   \[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
   So, there are 88 ruined castles.

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. The problem says that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we take half of 88:
   \[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]
   So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:
\[ 44 \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

**Furniture United:**
- They want $1,350 upfront.
- Then, they want 6 payments of $350 each.
- So, 6 payments * $350 = $2,100.
- Total cost = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

**Cozy Homes:**
- They want $1,100 upfront.
- Then, they want 9 payments of $250 each.
- So, 9 payments * $250 = $2,250.
- Total cost = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

**Difference:**
- The difference between the two is $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

So, the cost difference between the two offers is $100."

First, we need to count all the paintball guns they have:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- Richard (or RJ, I think it's a typo) has 5 guns.
- Richard (the other one) has 5 guns.

Now, let's add them up:
8 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 28 guns in total.

Next, we need to share these 28 guns equally among the 4 of them. So, we divide 28 by 4:
28 ÷ 4 = 7

So, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 7 guns.

The answer is: 7 guns."
"Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers and 70 ounces for each batch of fudge. 

To find out how much sugar he needs for 8 batches of suckers:
- 30 ounces per batch × 8 batches = 240 ounces

For 1 batch of fudge:
- 70 ounces

Now, add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:
- 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   - So, the total cost is \(8 \times 8 = 64\) dollars.

2. The stock price goes up by 50% in the first year.
   - 50% of $8 is \(0.50 \times 8 = 4\) dollars.
   - So, the new price per share is \(8 + 4 = 12\) dollars.

3. In the second year, the stock price goes down by 25%.
   - 25% of $12 is \(0.25 \times 12 = 3\) dollars.
   - So, the new price per share is \(12 - 3 = 9\) dollars.

4. Maria has 8 shares, so the total value is \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs. To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We have a class of 200 students split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two larger groups has \( x \) students. Then the smallest group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we add 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group has:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total. These animals are either chickens or cows. We know that he has twice as many chickens as cows. 

Let's say the number of cows is \( C \). Then the number of chickens would be \( 2C \) because he has twice as many chickens as cows.

The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, so:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, there are 20 cows. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows:
\[ 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, let's count the legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So:
- The total number of legs from cows is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
- The total number of legs from chickens is \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)

Adding these together gives:
\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts by juggling 3 balls. Each week, he adds 1 more ball. After 4 weeks, he will have added 4 more balls (1 ball each week for 4 weeks).

So, the total number of balls he can juggle after 4 weeks is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ balls} \]

During the performance, he drops 3 balls. Out of these, 2 are caught and 1 is lost.

So, the number of balls he has left to juggle is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ balls} \]

Therefore, the number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."
"Laurel got 24 baby outfits from her friend. At her baby shower, she got twice that amount, which is 24 times 2, so that's 48 outfits. Her mom gave her 15 more outfits. 

To find the total, we add them all up:
24 (from her friend) + 48 (from the baby shower) + 15 (from her mom) = 87

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits in total."
"Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more. So, we first find 1/5 of 5000 meters:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Tyson runs 6000 meters every day. June has 30 days, so we multiply 6000 meters by 30 days:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Juice Box A costs $4.
2. Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, so it's $4 + $5 = $9.
3. Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A, so it's $4 + $7 = $11.

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

$11 - $9 = $2.

So, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

The final answer is: $2"
"Sure, let's count the legs of the tables in the restaurant.

First, we have 40 tables with 4 legs each. So, we multiply 40 by 4:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]
This means the 40 tables have 160 legs.

Next, we have 50 tables with 3 legs each. So, we multiply 50 by 3:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]
This means the 50 tables have 150 legs.

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
\[ 160 + 150 = 310 \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag has 36 cookies. Her son takes 4 cookies for his lunch 5 days a week, so that's \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's \(1 \times 7 = 7\) cookies. 

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the cookies her son and husband eat from the total cookies in the bag:
\[ 36 - (20 + 7) = 36 - 27 = 9 \]

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

The answer is: 9"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out the discount on one shirt. The shirt costs $30 and there's a 40% discount. To find 40% of $30, we do:
   \[ 30 \times \frac{40}{100} = 30 \times 0.40 = 12 \]
   So, the discount on one shirt is $12.

2. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the price after the discount:
   \[ 30 - 12 = 18 \]
   So, one shirt costs $18 after the discount.

3. Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we need to find the total cost for 2 shirts:
   \[ 18 \times 2 = 36 \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Tractors:**
   - They used to sell 10 tractors a day.
   - Each tractor was sold for $100.
   - So, the daily revenue from tractors was \(10 \times 100 = 1000\) dollars.

2. **Silos:**
   - Now they sell 5 silos a day.
   - Each silo is sold for $220.
   - So, the daily revenue from silos is \(5 \times 220 = 1100\) dollars.

3. **Difference in Revenue:**
   - The difference in daily revenue is \(1100 - 1000 = 100\) dollars.

4. **Percentage Increase:**
   - To find out how much more they are making, we use the formula: \(\frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Revenue}} \times 100\).
   - So, \(\frac{100}{1000} \times 100 = 10\%\).

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"Sure, let's figure out how many hours Peyton's after-work activities will take.

1. On Monday, Peyton has a yoga class that lasts 1 hour.
2. On Tuesday, the cooking class is three times as long as the yoga class, so it's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. On Wednesday, there's a cheese-tasting event that lasts 0.5 hours (which is 30 minutes).
4. On Thursday, the museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class, so it's \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) hours.
5. On Friday, Peyton does two hours of errands.

Now, let's add all these hours together:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

3. Then she gave her brother $4, so she had:
   \[
   25 - 4 = 21
   \]

So, Andrea saved \(\boxed{21}\)."
"John did a few activities on his vacation. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time for boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

He also watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long. So, the total time for watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. To find the total time, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30 \times \text{Total Time} = 15 \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:

"Morgan has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends can play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and the go-karts cost $10 each ride. 

First, let's see how much it costs for Morgan to do all these things:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Go-karts (2 rides): $10 x 2 = $20
- Arcade tokens: $5

So, the total cost for Morgan is:
- $5 (mini-golf) + $20 (go-karts) + $5 (arcade tokens) = $30

Now, we subtract this from her total budget:
- $90 (total budget) - $30 (Morgan's cost) = $60

This $60 is left for her friends. Each friend will need the same amount as Morgan for mini-golf and go-karts, which is $25.

So, we divide the remaining money by the cost per friend:
- $60 ÷ $25 = 2.4

Since Morgan can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

The answer is: \boxed{2}"
"Marisa gets $5 every day. She spends $1 on lollipops each day because 4 lollipops at 25 cents each cost $1. So, she saves $5 - $1 = $4 each day. If she saves for 5 days, she will have $4 \times 5 = $20 in her piggy bank.

So, the answer is: \boxed{20}"
"Billy has $10 to spend on candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. After buying candy, he spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much he spent on gumballs:
- Each gumball costs $0.05.
- He bought 40 gumballs.
- So, the total cost for gumballs is \(40 \times 0.05 = 2\) dollars.

Next, we need to find out how much money he had before buying gumballs:
- He spent $2 on gumballs.
- He initially had $10.
- So, the amount left after buying gumballs is \(10 - 2 = 8\) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much money he had before buying candy:
- He spent half of his remaining money on gumballs.
- Let's say he had \(x\) dollars before buying gumballs.
- According to the problem, \(\frac{x}{2} = 2\).
- So, \(x = 2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

Finally, we need to find out how much money he spent on candy:
- He initially had $10.
- He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
- So, the amount spent on candy is \(10 - 4 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we need to find out how many pounds of candy he bought:
- The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
- He spent $6 on candy.
- So, the number of pounds of candy is \(\frac{6}{1.5} = 4\) pounds.

"Carver just turned 45 years old. The problem says that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Let's figure out his son's age step by step.

1. If we let his son's age be \( x \), then twice his son's age would be \( 2x \).
2. Since Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, we can write the equation: \( 45 = 2x - 5 \).
3. To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation: \( 45 + 5 = 2x \), which gives us \( 50 = 2x \).
4. Now, we divide both sides by 2: \( x = \frac{50}{2} \), which gives us \( x = 25 \).

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
2. Then it travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
3. From the third city back to the first city, it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two trips. So, the distance is \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one full trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

The train does this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance it travels in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide 18,000 by 900:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

The answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
2. A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
3. A collie bed needs the average of the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds. So, we add 8 and 2, then divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, a collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing.

4. Now, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
   \[
   4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. We also need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 3 collie beds:
   \[
   3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

6. Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Mark needs \(\boxed{23}\) pounds of stuffing."
"John drives to his friend's house, which is 200 miles away, but he takes a detour that adds 10 miles. So, the total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. He drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by the speed: 210 miles ÷ 70 miles per hour = 3 hours.

After visiting his friend, John drives back home, which is 240 miles. He drives at a speed of 80 miles per hour. Again, we divide the distance by the speed: 240 miles ÷ 80 miles per hour = 3 hours.

To find the total time for the trip, we add the time for both parts: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

So, the total time the trip took is 6 hours."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the frames is \(44 \times 20 = 880\) dollars.
   - Each frame also needs to be etched, which costs an extra 20% of $20. So, the extra cost per frame is \(20 \times 0.20 = 4\) dollars.
   - The total extra cost for etching is \(44 \times 4 = 176\) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for the picture frames and etching is \(880 + 176 = 1056\) dollars.

2. **Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will get pins that cost $5 each.
   - So, the total cost for the pins is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.

3. **Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so \(44 \times \frac{1}{4} = 11\) seniors are officers.
   - Each officer gets a cord that costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for the cords is \(11 \times 12 = 132\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**

- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

So, the total pairs sold is \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs. Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is \(50 \times 2 = 100\).

The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Hallie had dance practice on different days of the week. Let's add up the hours she practiced each day:

- On Tuesday, she practiced for 1 hour.
- On Thursday, she practiced for 2 hours.
- On Saturday, she practiced for twice as long as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, let's add these hours together:

1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Thursday) + 2 (Saturday) = 5 hours.

So, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 5 hours a week.

**Answer: 5 hours**"
"The company bought equipment worth $400,000. But 40% of this equipment was faulty. To find out how much the faulty equipment is worth, we calculate 40% of $400,000:

\[ 40\% \times 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

So, the faulty equipment is worth $160,000. The functioning equipment is the total value minus the faulty value:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, give 2 kg of milk each day.

For the 15 sheep giving 1 kg each:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg

For the 15 sheep giving 2 kg each:
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, add the milk from both groups:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

**45**"
"Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She gave 1 roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of these 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

The answer is 48 pieces."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. There are 40 pupils in the class.
2. Half of the class likes blue, so \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) pupils like blue.
3. After removing the 20 pupils who like blue, we have \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils left.
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) pupils like green.
5. The rest of the pupils like yellow, so \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) pupils like yellow.

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"Lucy sells apples for $4 each. On Monday, she sold enough apples to get $56. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide $56 by $4:

\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, she picked:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Now, to find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day:

\[ 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

So, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs, which is 20 socks, and 15 more loose socks. So, she washed a total of \(20 + 15 = 35\) socks. 

To find out how many socks she missed, we subtract the socks she washed from the total socks she had:

\[50 - 35 = 15\]

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks. 

The answer is 15."
"Rachel started with 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, she had:
\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]
Then, her brother ate 44 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is:
\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

The number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. To find out how much she has to pay each month, we need to add the interest to the principal and then divide by the number of months.

First, let's find the interest:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{10}{100} \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = 3650 \times \frac{50}{1200} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount she has to pay is:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Now, we divide this total amount by 5 to find the monthly payment:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

So, Karan has to pay $760.42 each month.

The correct answer is: \boxed{760.42}"
"Cho hiked for 8 hours at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour. So, the distance Cho hiked is:
\[ 14 \text{ km/h} \times 8 \text{ h} = 112 \text{ km} \]

Chloe hiked for 5 hours at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:
\[ 9 \text{ km/h} \times 5 \text{ h} = 45 \text{ km} \]

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
\[ 112 \text{ km} - 45 \text{ km} = 67 \text{ km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together:
- Total silver pesos: Axel's 50 + Anna's 100 = 150 silver pesos.
- Total gold pesos: Axel's 80 + Anna's 120 = 200 gold pesos.

So, the total number of pesos they have together is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Millie makes lemonade and sells it to earn money. She spends $18 to make enough lemonade for 36 cups. She sells each cup for $1 and sells 4 cups every hour. To find out how much money she makes per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total money she makes from selling all the lemonade.
2. Subtract the cost of making the lemonade to find the profit.
3. Divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade.

First, she makes 36 cups of lemonade and sells each cup for $1, so she makes:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of making the lemonade:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. She sells 4 cups every hour, so:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, we find the profit per hour by dividing the total profit by the number of hours:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. We need to find out how much land he had at first.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. If Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, he has 2/5 of his land left.
2. We know that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares.
3. To find out how much 1 hectare is, we can set up a simple equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \text{ of the land} = 12.8 \text{ hectares}
   \]
4. To find the whole land, we need to find out what 1/5 of the land is, and then multiply by 5.
5. First, we find 1/5 of the land:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \text{ of the land} = \frac{12.8}{2} = 6.4 \text{ hectares}
   \]
6. Now, to find the whole land, we multiply 6.4 by 5:
   \[
   6.4 \times 5 = 32 \text{ hectares}
   \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

The answer is \boxed{32}."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The choir has 52 members, and half of them are girls. So, the number of girls is:
   \[
   \frac{52}{2} = 26

2. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]

3. The number of girls who perform is:
   \[
   26 - 13 = 13
   \]

4. Three teachers also decide to sing with them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:
   \[
   13 + 3 = 16
   \]

So, the final answer is 16."
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

His test scores are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, let's add them up:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much 6 erasers cost. Each eraser costs $2, so:
   \[
   6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2 \text{ per eraser} = \$12
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how much 8 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $3, so:
   \[
   8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3 \text{ per pencil} = \$24
   \]

3. Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together to get the total cost:
   \[
   \$12 + \$24 = \$36
   \]

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. He delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, which means he delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \) messages to Mr. Yu.

\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages delivered is 88."
"David and Dasha went to a carnival with 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket is $2. So, each ride costs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars. For 9 rides, Dasha would need \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars.

David bought a bracelet for $30 that lets him ride 9 times. So, David only spent $30.

To find out how much David saved, we need to see the difference between what Dasha spent and what David spent. Dasha spent $36, and David spent $30. So, David saved \(36 - 30 = 6\) dollars.

The answer is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Monica is wrapping gifts for Christmas. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. That makes a total of:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, she has 12 gifts to wrap. She has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for each gift. To find out how much ribbon she can use for each bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We know that the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.
2. Together, they have 165 popsicles.
3. To find out how many parts make up the total, we add the numbers in the ratio: 5 + 6 = 11.
4. Now, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts: 165 ÷ 11 = 15. This means each part is equal to 15 popsicles.
5. To find out how many popsicles Betty has, we multiply her part of the ratio by 15: 5 × 15 = 75.
6. To find out how many popsicles Sam has, we multiply his part of the ratio by 15: 6 × 15 = 90.
7. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is: \boxed{15}"
"Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and get streaming services instead. Netflix costs $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but if you get all three together, you save 20%. 

First, let's find out how much Hulu and Disney Plus cost together without the discount:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, with the 20% discount, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus together is:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for all three streaming services is:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Tim's old cable package cost $60 a month. So, the money he saves by cancelling his cable and getting the streaming services is:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

But the question asks how much he saves, and the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, which is half the time she spends recording it, so she spends 2 hours recording. She also spends 90 minutes editing, which is 1.5 hours.

To find the total time she spends, we add up all the time:
- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

So, the total time is:
\[ 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many slots there are in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so we multiply 6 by 6:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

This means there are 36 slots in total.

Next, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of slots. So, we need to double the number of slots and then add 20:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Erica started with 20 cards she made herself. Her dad gave her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 times 15, which is 30 cards. So, Erica had 20 + 30 = 50 cards in total.

She gave out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, which is 24 + 5 = 29 cards. She also received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica has now, we need to subtract the cards she gave out from her total and then add the cards she received. So, 50 - 29 + 17 = 38 cards.

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. First, let's find out how many slices that is.

For Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

For Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats and the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Mark has $50 in his bank account and he wants to buy a bike that costs $300. He earns $10 each day. To find out how many days he needs to save, we first need to see how much more money he needs. 

$300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (money he already has) = $250 (money he needs to save).

Now, since he earns $10 each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to save $250. 

$250 ÷ $10 per day = 25 days.

So, Mark needs to save for 25 days. The answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Nancy saw 90 spiders. She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, so she saw \( \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30 \) millipedes. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so she saw \( 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \) stink bugs. To find the total number of bugs, we add the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together: \( 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \).

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is \( \boxed{168} \)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know Erica is 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is \(30 + 5 = 35\) years old.
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is \(35 + 7 = 42\) years old.
4. To find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age: \(42 - 30 = 12\).

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

The answer is: \(\boxed{12}\)"
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk. Each glass is 8 ounces, so he drinks \(2 \times 8 = 16\) ounces of milk. If milk has 3 calories per ounce, then the total calories he consumes are \(16 \times 3 = 48\) calories.

2. There are 4 weeks in a month, so the builder works \(6 \times 4 = 24\) days in a month.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so the builder works \(24 \times 12 = 288\) days in a year.
4. The builder gets paid $50 every day, so in a year, he earns \(288 \times 50 = 14400\) dollars.

So, the builder earns \(\boxed{14400}\) dollars in a year."
"To make a quadruple batch of brownies, we need to use more flour and milk than the normal recipe calls for.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: 3 cups × 4 = 12 cups
- Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we need 12 cups ÷ 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour.

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: 1 cup × 4 = 4 cups
- Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need 4 cups ÷ 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk:
- Bags of flour: 6
- Bottles of milk: 2
- Difference: 6 - 2 = 4

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

**Final Answer: 4**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mel uses an air conditioner that uses 900 watts of energy each hour.
2. He uses it for 8 hours a day, so the energy used each day is:
   \[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]
3. Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is 1000 watts, we convert 7200 watts to kilowatts:
   \[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the energy used each day now is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Over 30 days, the total savings is:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each. So, that's \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes.
2. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes.
3. Another zebra has half the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes, so that's \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes.

Now, let's add all the stripes together:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[\frac{88}{4} = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Tyson is making muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Each sandwich serves 4 people, and there are 20 people watching the game. 

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make:
- 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Next, we need to find out how much meat and cheese he needs:
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat
- 5 sandwiches * 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese

Now, we need to find out how much the meat and cheese will cost:
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds * $7.00 = $35.00
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds * $3.00 = $15.00

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese together:
- $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

So, Tyson will spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so now he has \(40 + 60 = 100\) cannolis.
4. He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he buys \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
5. This means he now has \(80 - 20 = 60\) corns.
6. Now, we add the total number of cannolis and corns: \(100 + 60 = 160\).

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He walked half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

First, let's find out how many steps he had taken before his jog:
- Steps to and from school: 5,000
- Steps with his friend: 1,000
- Total steps before jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

He had 2,000 steps left after his jog, so the total steps he had taken before his jog plus the steps during his jog should be 10,000:
- Steps before jog: 6,000
- Steps left: 2,000
- Total steps: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000

So, the steps he took during his jog are:
- Steps taken during jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

The answer is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"Toby is reading a book that has 45 pages. On average, each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a speed of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After finishing the book, Toby needs 10 more minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time from the start of reading until he leaves for the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early he will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **May:**
   - They hired 40 employees.
   - Each employee gets $15 per hour.
   - They work 40 hours a week.
   - So, each employee gets \(15 \times 40 = 600\) dollars a week.
   - For 40 employees, the total is \(600 \times 40 = 24000\) dollars.

2. **June:**
   - In June, 1/4 of the employees left.
   - So, \(1/4 \times 40 = 10\) employees left.
   - That means \(40 - 10 = 30\) employees are left.
   - Each of these 30 employees still gets $600 a week.
   - So, for 30 employees, the total is \(600 \times 30 = 18000\) dollars.

3. **Total for both months:**
   - For May, they paid 24000 dollars.
   - For June, they paid 18000 dollars.
   - So, the total is \(24000 + 18000 = 42000\) dollars.

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is **42000** dollars."
"Sally went to the seashore and her parents gave her $10. She bought taffy, seashells, and magnets.

First, let's look at the taffy. The taffy was on sale: buy 1 pound for $3 and get 1 pound at half price. So, for 2 pounds, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (half of $3).

So, the taffy cost her:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

So, the seashells and magnets together cost:
\[ 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 2.50 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Tim buys two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much, so it costs $800. The total cost before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200. He gets a 20% discount on the fireworks, so he saves $1200 \times 0.20 = $240. After the discount, the fireworks cost $1200 - $240 = $960. He also buys a finale firework for $150. So, the total amount he spends is $960 + $150 = $1110.

The final answer is \boxed{1110}."
"Shannon eats 2 cookies every night. She wants enough cookies to last her for 30 days.

First, we need to find out how many cookies she eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we need to know how many dozens of cookies that is. Since 1 dozen is 12 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies.

The answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
2. 1% of these candles will explode. So, we need to find 1% of 50,000.
3. To find 1% of 50,000, we can divide 50,000 by 100 (since 1% is the same as 1/100).
4. \( 50,000 \div 100 = 500 \).

So, 500 candles will explode.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. The problem doesn't give us a specific number for this, but if we assume that the defects are independent, we can use the percentage of candles that smell like wet dog, which is 5%.

5. To find 5% of 500, we can multiply 500 by 5% (or 0.05).
6. \( 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \).

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is 25.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{25}\)"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find the price of one blouse after the discount. The original price is $20, and it's 30% off. So, we calculate 70% of $20 because 100% - 30% = 70%.

   \[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

   So, one blouse costs $14 after the discount.

2. Now, Misha picks 4 blouses. We need to find the total cost for 4 blouses at $14 each.

   \[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses is $56.

The final answer is: \boxed{56}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Joanne picks 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She picks half of that from the shortest trees, so that's \(30 \div 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let's say Joanne picks \(x\) apples from the average trees.

So, the total apples Joanne picks is \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

Now, her sister picks:
- Twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne, so \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
- Three times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne, so \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

So, the total apples her sister picks is \(60 + 45 = 105\).

Together, they picked 500 apples. So, we can write the equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne picked 350 apples from the average trees.

The answer is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know:
- Camels and dromedaries together have 180 heads.
- Camels and dromedaries together have 304 humps.

Since each animal has one head, the number of camels plus the number of dromedaries equals 180:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

Camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, so the total number of humps is:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now, let's use these two equations to find out how many dromedaries there are.

First, we can find the number of camels by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days. So, the total distance for the first 4 days is:
   \[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

2. Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, the distance for the next two days is:
   \[ 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \]

3. On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
   \[ 0 \text{ km} \]

4. During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance for the second week is:
   \[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

5. Now, we add up all the distances:
   \[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, to find Zack's locker size, we multiply Peter's size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, to find Timothy's locker size, we multiply Zack's size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to a ledge at 6,000 feet. Oliver is at 3,000 feet. To reach the comb, Oliver needs to climb from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.

So, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The answer is 3,000 feet."
"Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's $4000 \times 2 = $8000. He also had $5000 of his own money. So, to find out how much money he has now, we add all these amounts together:

$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) + $5000 (his own money) = $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. We start with 50 cats on a rock.
2. Four boats came and each boat took away 5 cats. So, \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away.
3. Now, we subtract the 20 cats from the initial 50 cats: \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats are left.
4. Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, \( \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\) cats ran after the mouse.
5. Finally, we subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left: \(30 - 18 = 12\) cats are left on the rock.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 each month. So, \(6 \times 8 = 48\). That's $48 for the first 6 months.
2. For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 each month. So, \(8 \times 12 = 96\). That's $96 for the next 8 months.
3. For the last 8 months, the cost is $14 each month. So, \(8 \times 14 = 112\). That's $112 for the last 8 months.

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[48 + 96 + 112 = 256\]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{256}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The tattered jeans cost $28.
2. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so:
   \[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]
   So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

3. Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of this from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
4. 1/3 of $6 is:
   \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
   So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans:
   \[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]
   So, he saved $4 from the tattered jeans.

5. The original price of the jogger jeans is $24 because:
   \[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]
   (The $2 is the savings from the jogger jeans.)

6. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.

7. The difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
   \[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Sure, let's figure out how many employees can go on the day trip.

First, we have 4 big buses. Each bus can hold 60 people. So, for the buses:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ people} \]

Next, we have 6 minibusses. Each minibus can hold 30 people. So, for the minibusses:
\[ 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ people} \]

Then, we have 10 minivans. Each minivan can hold 15 people. So, for the minivans:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add all these together to find out the total number of people that can go on the trip:
\[ 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian made 3 bird feeders herself and bought 3 more. The feeders she made attract 10 more birds than the ones she bought. The bought feeders attract 20 birds each, so the homemade ones attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each.

Now, let's count the total number of birds:
- For the 3 homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds = 90 birds
- For the 3 bought feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds = 60 birds

Adding these together:
90 birds + 60 birds = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see \boxed{150} birds in her garden each day."
"Sure, let's figure out how much Aleksandra paid for her dinner step by step.

1. The bagel costs $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find out how much more, we calculate 25% of $4, which is $1. So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Half of $4 is $2.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

So, the total cost is $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) dollars for her dinner."
"Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He also wants to have $50 in spending cash. So, he needs a total of $100 + $50 = $150.

Each card is sold for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money by the price per card: $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards.

Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest. If he sold 100 cards, which is 2/3 of his total cards, then we can find out the total number of cards he started with by solving the equation:

If 2/3 of the cards is 100, then 1/3 of the cards is 100 ÷ 2 = 50 cards.

So, the total number of cards he started with is 50 × 3 = 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The caterer was supposed to make enough hotdogs for 36 guests.
2. Half of the guests (18 guests) were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each. So, \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
3. The other half (18 guests) were supposed to have 1 hotdog each. So, \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
4. In total, the caterer prepared \(36 + 18 = 54\) hotdogs.

Now, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog:
5. The 18 guests who were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each already got their 2 hotdogs, so they used \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
6. The remaining 22 guests each want 1 more hotdog, so they need \(22 \times 1 = 22\) hotdogs.
7. In total, the guests need \(36 + 22 = 58\) hotdogs.

The caterer only prepared 54 hotdogs, so there are \(58 - 54 = 4\) hotdogs short.

Therefore, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. 

First, we find half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we add 4 more letters to this half:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters. 

Now, we add the letters in both names:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

The total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

The answer is: \boxed{13}"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The pot and pans cost $120.00.
2. The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
3. Each utensil costs $5.00, and there are 5 utensils, so \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars for the utensils.

Now, let's add these up:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

This is the total cost before the discount. The store is giving a 20% discount, which means Charlotte only pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we do:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"

So, the total cost is:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we need to see how much money Dora has:
- She saved $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

So, the total money Dora has is:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money Dora needs:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy all the items."
"Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Prince Arthur killed three quarters of what Prince Thaddeus killed. So, we calculate three quarters of 100:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons. Prince Walter killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we multiply 75 by 2:

\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \]

Prince Walter killed 150 dragons. Prince Bruce killed one-fifth of what Prince Walter killed. So, we divide 150 by 5:

\[ \frac{150}{5} = 30 \]

Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 15 gallons of gas and we need to divide it equally into 5 containers.
2. So, each container gets \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) gallons.
3. Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container.
4. So, she needs \( \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \) gallons.
5. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) pints.

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. George had $5.
2. He spent 1% of his money and had $0.05 left.
3. So, he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Next, we know he bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each:
4. 3 bags of chips cost 3 × $0.40 = $1.20.

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent:
5. $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:
6. $3.75 ÷ $0.75 = 5.

So, George bought 5 candy bars.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so he shared the rest with his friends. The number of lollipops he shared is:

25 - 5 = 20

He shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. So, each friend got:

20 ÷ 4 = 5

So, each friend received 5 lollipops. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cut the cake into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each had one piece, so they ate 2 pieces in total. Each piece weighs 2.5 ounces (because 20 divided by 8 is 2.5). So, they ate 2 times 2.5 ounces, which is 5 ounces. The cake originally weighed 20 ounces, and they ate 5 ounces, so the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces (because 20 minus 5 is 15).

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges. They are sharing these oranges equally with their 6 friends, so there are 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people in total. If we divide the 56 oranges by 8 people, each person will get 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Antoine is making French onion soup. His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he will use 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the onions will cost him 4 pounds times $2.00, which is $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is on sale for $2.00. So, the beef stock will cost him 2 boxes times $2.00, which is $4.00.

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock together. The total cost is $8.00 plus $4.00, which is $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people. To find out the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings. So, $12.00 divided by 6 servings is $2.00 per serving.

The cost per serving is $2.00.

So, the answer is: \boxed{2}"
"Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater. Bernadette's drive takes four times longer, so that's 4 times 4, which is 16 minutes. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes and Bernadette takes 16 minutes, she needs to leave 12 minutes earlier to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The answer is: 12 minutes."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to know how big the room is. The area of Billie's room is 360 square feet. We also know that the length of the room is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, the length in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet). To find the width, we use the area formula for a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
So,
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now we have the length (9 feet) and the width (40 feet). To find the perimeter, we use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
So,
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So:
- Margareth's beads: \(3 + 4 = 7\) packs
- \(7 \times 20 = 140\) beads

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
- \(140 - 60 = 80\)

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final answer is 80."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven makes the house 5 degrees warmer every hour. So, for 3 hours, the temperature goes up by:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial temperature:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window makes the house 2 degrees cooler every 10 minutes. So, for 30 minutes, the temperature goes down by:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

So, the final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jon's total time for the triathlon:
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes

   So, Jon's total time = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

2. James's time for the swim:
   - James is 10% faster, so he takes 90% of Jon's swim time.
   - 90% of 40 minutes = 0.90 × 40 = 36 minutes

3. James's time for the bike ride:
   - James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon.
   - Jon's bike ride time = 80 minutes
   - So, James's bike ride time = 80 + 5 = 85 minutes

4. Let's say James's run time is \( x \) minutes.

5. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time.
   - Jon's total time = 170 minutes
   - So, James's total time = 170 + 10 = 180 minutes

6. Now, we can write the equation for James's total time:
   - Swim + Bike ride + Run = 180 minutes
   - 36 + 85 + \( x \) = 180

7. Solve for \( x \):
   - 121 + \( x \) = 180
   - \( x \) = 180 - 121
   - \( x \) = 59

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer: \(\boxed{59}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:
   \[
   1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, the length of Movie B is:
   \[
   75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, the length of Movie A is:
   \[
   \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}

So, the length of Movie A is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
2. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the horse runs:
   \[ 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

3. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse eats:
   \[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

4. Each bail of hay costs $3, so for 8 bails, the cost is:
   \[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

5. Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
   \[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

6. The change Michael gets after buying the hay is:
   \[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Rozanne is making eggnog and needs to figure out how many trays she can put out. She uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 more eggs. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs are \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Adding the 2 extra eggs, she has \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs in total.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, with 50 eggs, she can make \(\frac{50}{5} = 10\) glasses of eggnog.

Each tray holds 5 glasses. So, with 10 glasses, she can put out \(\frac{10}{5} = 2\) trays.

The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Joey starts with 214 points and scores 26 more points.
   - So, Joey's new total is \(214 + 26 = 240\) points.

2. Marcy starts with 225 points and scores 10 more points.
   - So, Marcy's new total is \(225 + 10 = 235\) points.

3. To find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's total from Joey's total.
   - So, \(240 - 235 = 5\).

Joey is now winning by 5 points.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{5}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. To find out how much each sneaker cost, we divide $576 by 48:
   \[
   \frac{576}{48} = 12
   \]
   So, each sneaker cost $12.

2. On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each. To find out how much money he made from these sales, we multiply 17 by $20:
   \[
   17 \times 20 = 340
   \]
   So, he made $340 from the flash sale.

3. He had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left to sell to the department store. He sold each of these for $25. To find out how much money he made from these sales, we multiply 31 by $25:
   \[
   31 \times 25 = 775
   \]
   So, he made $775 from selling to the department store.

4. To find out the total money he made from all sales, we add the money from the flash sale and the money from the department store:
   \[
   340 + 775 = 1115
   \]
   So, he made $1115 in total.

5. To find out his profit, we subtract the cost of the sneakers from the total money he made:
   \[
   1115 - 576 = 539
   \]
   So, his profit is $539.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{539}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Beatrice bought 6 packets with 8 crayons each. So, we calculate:
   \[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]
   This means she has 48 crayons from these packets.

2. She also bought 4 packets with 16 crayons each. So, we calculate:
   \[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]
   This means she has 64 crayons from these packets.

3. Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total number of crayons:
   \[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

So, the total number of crayons Beatrice bought is \(\boxed{112}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's say the popcorn costs $P
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost: $12 + $P + $3 = $15 + $P

3. **Savings:**
   - You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - So, the regular ticket option should cost $2 less than the super ticket option.
   - $21 - ($15 + $P) = $2

4. **Find the Popcorn Price:**
   - $21 - $15 - $P = $2
   - $6 - $P = $2
   - $P = $6 - $2
   - $P = $4

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one helium balloon on the first day. We know that 20 balloons cost $900. So, we divide $900 by 20:
   \[
   \frac{900}{20} = 45
   \]
   So, one balloon costs $45 on the first day.

2. Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost for one balloon is:
   \[
   45 + 20 = 65
   \]
   So, one balloon now costs $65.

3. Now, we need to find out how much it costs to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost per balloon by 170:
   \[
   170 \times 65 = 11050
   \]

So, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is \(\boxed{11050}\)."
"To find out the car's average speed, we need to know the total distance it traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's find the distance for each part of the trip:
- For the first part, the car went 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance is \(60 \times 2 = 120\) miles.
- For the second part, the car went 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. So, the distance is \(30 \times 1 = 30\) miles.

Now, let's add these distances to get the total distance:
- Total distance = \(120 + 30 = 150\) miles.

Next, let's find the total time:
- Total time = \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = \(\frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}\).

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800 and each ruby is worth $1200.

First, let's see how many sapphires she has left:
- She starts with 8 sapphires and trades away 3, so she has \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires left.

Now, let's find out the value of the sapphires she has left:
- Each sapphire is worth $800, so 5 sapphires are worth \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.

Next, let's find out the value of the rubies she gets:
- She gets 2 rubies, and each ruby is worth $1200, so 2 rubies are worth \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value:
- The total value is \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars.

So, the total value of all her jewels is \(\boxed{6400}\) dollars."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much soil one raised bed needs. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one bed is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:
   \[
   10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

3. Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. So, the number of bags needed is:
   \[
   \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags}
   \]

4. Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
   \[
   160 \times 12 = 1920

So, the total cost of the potting soil is \(\boxed{1920}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 15 red cards.
2. Green cards are 60% more than the red cards. So, we need to find 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   - 60% of 15 is \(0.60 \times 15 = 9\).
   - So, the number of green cards is \(15 + 9 = 24\).
3. Yellow cards are the sum of red and green cards.
   - So, the number of yellow cards is \(15 + 24 = 39\).
4. Now, we add all the cards together to find the total.
   - Total cards = red cards + green cards + yellow cards
   - Total cards = \(15 + 24 + 39 = 78\).

So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Katelyn saw 50 fairies first. Then, 25 more fairies joined them. So, the total became 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. After that, 30 fairies flew away. So, 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remained.

The final number of fairies is 45."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find out how many puppies in total there are. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each 1 pound.
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Now, add all the weights together:
\[3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490 \text{ pounds}\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4490}{2250} \approx 2.0044

"Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth 2 cents, and a plastic bottle is worth 3 cents. She drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda and 5 plastic bottles of water a week.

First, let's find out how much she earns from the cans:
- She has 3 cans.
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, \(3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}\).

Next, let's find out how much she earns from the bottles:
- She has 5 bottles.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, \(5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}\).

Now, let's add the earnings from cans and bottles to find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\).

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings for four weeks = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

So, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room.

Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks. Then, the number of cookies he can have is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to know the length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is half a foot (0.5 feet).

2. Benny saw 2 remoras, so we need to find the total length of the remoras. We do this by multiplying the length of one remora by 2:
   \[ 0.5 \text{ feet} \times 2 = 1 \text{ foot} \]

3. The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find out what percentage the remoras make up of the shark's body length, we use this formula:
   \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

4. Plugging in the numbers:
   \[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know there are 32 kids in Gina's class.
2. Nine kids are allergic to dairy.
3. Six kids are allergic to peanuts.
4. Three kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

To find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of these things, we need to be careful not to count the three kids who are allergic to both twice. So, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and peanuts, and then subtract the number of kids allergic to both:

\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of these things. 

Now, to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Plane Tickets**: The cost for each plane ticket is $5000. Since there are two tickets, we need to multiply $5000 by 2.
   \[
   5000 \times 2 = 10000
   \]
   So, the plane tickets cost $10000.

2. **Hotel Cost**: The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. But it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. First, we find 20% of $1500.
   \[
   1500 \times 0.20 = 300
   \]
   So, the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day. Since they stay for 3 days, we multiply $1800 by 3.
   \[
   1800 \times 3 = 5400
   \]
   So, the hotel costs $5400.

3. **Total Cost**: Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel.
   \[
   10000 + 5400 = 15400
   \]

So, the total cost of the trip is $15400.

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"Keegan and Tashay are trying to raise money for a baseball camp. They need $200 in total. By 3 pm, Keegan had $83 and Tasha had $91. To find out how much more they need, we add what they have and then subtract from their goal.

Keegan and Tasha together have: $83 + $91 = $174

They need: $200 - $174 = $26

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal.

The answer is $26."
"Gabriel has 20 songs on his player, and Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. So, Luri has:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Each player can hold up to 100 songs. So, Gabriel can add:

\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

And Luri can add:

\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked. To find out how many oranges that is, we do:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. Since he agreed to give $10 for each orange he eats, the total amount of money he gave up is:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

The total amount of money Stetson gave up is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. Her shoes cost $80. 

First, we need to find 3 times the cost of her shoes:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.
2. Each horse is fed twice a day, so each horse eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) pounds of oats per day.
3. Uncle Ben has 4 horses, so all the horses together eat \(10 \times 4 = 40\) pounds of oats per day.
4. We need to feed the horses for 5 days, so they will eat \(40 \times 5 = 200\) pounds of oats in total.
5. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so Uncle Ben needs \(\frac{200}{50} = 4\) bags of oats.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians. To find out how many Pomeranians she has, we can do:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Cost of Razors:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - She gets 2 packs but only pays for 1 because of the ""buy one get one free"" sale.
   - So, she pays $4.00 for 2 packs.

2. **Using the Coupon:**
   - She has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After using the coupon, she pays $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack has 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, she gets 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - She paid $2.00 for 8 razors.
   - So, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.
   - In cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"The shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall. In a human pyramid, the shortest cheerleader is at the top. So, the height of the human pyramid is 60 inches.

"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. Each morning, he spends $6, and each afternoon, he spends $2.

First, let's find out how much he spends in the morning:
- He drives in the morning 14 days.
- Each morning, he spends $6.
- So, for the mornings, he spends \(14 \times 6 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much he spends in the afternoon:
- He drives in the afternoon 14 days.
- Each afternoon, he spends $2.
- So, for the afternoons, he spends \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.

"To find out how many guests make the two venues cost the same, we need to set up a simple equation.

For the first venue:
- It costs $200 no matter how many guests come.
- Plus, it costs $5 for each guest.

For the second venue:
- It costs $25 for each guest, and that includes food.

We want to know when these costs are the same. So, we set up the equation:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, let's solve this:
1. Subtract 5x from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests that makes the two venues cost the same is 10.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say David found \( D \) insects.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

Now, we know that together they found 43 insects. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found \(\boxed{16}\) insects."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. So, if the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So, if the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

**Final Answer:**

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We know that the house and the lot together cost $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \). Then the cost of the house would be \( 3L \).

So, the total cost is:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, the cost of the house is \( 3L \):
\[ 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

The final answer is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

"Heather has a big bag of 27 cups of raisins. She wants to use some of these raisins to make oatmeal cookies. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to see how many 3/4 cups fit into 27 cups. But first, we need to divide the raisins equally among the three things she is making: oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix.

So, we divide 27 cups by 3:
\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]
This means each of the three things gets 9 cups of raisins.

Now, we need to see how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins. Since each batch needs 3/4 of a cup, we divide 9 by 3/4:
\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour every day. If she uses electricity for 24 hours a day, her daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh} \]

In a week, she uses:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2016 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, so her weekly bill before adding the new device is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3024 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, if she adds a new device that uses 2 kilowatts per hour, her new daily consumption is:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh} + 48 \, \text{kWh} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \]

In a week, her new consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2352 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost of her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3528 \, \text{\$} \]

The difference between her old and new weekly bills is:
\[ 3528 \, \text{\$} - 3024 \, \text{\$} = 504 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house.
2. If 5 people work together, they can do the work faster.
3. Since 1 person takes 10 days for a whole house, 5 people can do it in 2 days (because 10 days divided by 5 people is 2 days).
4. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 2 days, it would be \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The answer is: \(\boxed{48}\)"
"Ophelia and Jenna live in the same apartment building. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, she has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ chairs} \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, Jenna has:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \text{ chairs} \]

Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has:
\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \text{ sofas} \]

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs:
Ophelia's sofas: 20
Ophelia's chairs: 22
Jenna's sofas: 64
Jenna's chairs: 66

Total number of sofas:
\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]

Total number of chairs:
\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"Tom bought a CD for $4 and paid $48 in total. To find out how much the headphone set cost, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount:

\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set cost $44. If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left to buy more CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs he could buy:

\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

So, Tom could buy 11 more CDs if he didn't buy the headphone set.

The answer is: \(\boxed{11}\)"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

Josh worked out for 4 hours every week, except for some weeks. He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and for 6 hours for 1 week.

First, let's find out how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours:
- Total weeks: 8
- Weeks he worked out for 5 hours: 2
- Weeks he worked out for 6 hours: 1
So, weeks he worked out for 4 hours: \(8 - 2 - 1 = 5\)

Now, let's calculate the total hours for each type of week:
- Hours for 4-hour weeks: \(5 \times 4 = 20\)
- Hours for 5-hour weeks: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- Hours for 6-hour week: \(1 \times 6 = 6\)

Finally, let's add all these hours together:
- Total hours: \(20 + 10 + 6 = 36\)

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, the number of people who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 people got off, the number of people who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of people riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, right now, Jame is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.

3. In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

4. If Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then right now, Jame's cousin is \(55 - 8 = 47\) years old.

5. The age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $400 less than the computer. So, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost and the cost of the computer and the printer. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600.

Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."

"Sure, let's figure out the total thickness of the four books step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, let's add up the thicknesses:
- First book: 31 mm
- Second book: 50 mm
- Third book: 45 mm
- Fourth book: 62 mm

Adding them together:
\[31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - There is $18 to be shared among 3 boys. So, each boy gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's break it down in a simple way!

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so it's split into two halves of 15 days each.

Let's say Elvis saves $x each day in the first half. In the second half, he saves twice as much, so he saves $2x each day.

For the first half:
- He saves $x each day for 15 days, so he saves \(15x\) in total.

For the second half:
- He saves $2x each day for 15 days, so he saves \(15 \times 2x = 30x\) in total.

So, the total savings for the month is:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know he wants to save $1125 in total, so:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, in the second half, he saves \(2x = 2 \times 25 = 50\) dollars each day.

The answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Verna bought some fruits. She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, 5 oranges at $0.80 each, and 6 peaches at $0.75 each. She gave $20 to the seller.

- For apples: \(3 \times 1.50 = 4.50\)
- For oranges: \(5 \times 0.80 = 4.00\)
- For peaches: \(6 \times 0.75 = 4.50\)

Now, let's add up the total cost:
\(4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00\)

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
\(20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\)

So, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jairus gets $0.8 for each task. If he did 20 tasks, he would get:
   \[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]
   So, Jairus gets $16.

2. Jenny gets $0.5 for each task. If she did 20 tasks, she would get:
   \[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]
   So, Jenny gets $10.

3. To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:
   \[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]
   So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this together! Jeff and Brad are sharing 100 dollars. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. 

The total amount is:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much Brad gets, we divide 100 by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written.

1. Writing the alphabet in full twice:
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. Writing half of the alphabet once:
   - Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing half of it once: 13 letters.

3. Re-writing everything she has already written:
   - The total number of letters written so far is \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything: 65 letters.

4. Calculating the total number of letters written:

"Mark lost 10 pounds every month for 3 months. That means he lost a total of 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds. If his final weight was 70 pounds, then his initial weight was 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"Jonathan wants to have a play set that is five times bigger than James's play set. James has 80 toys, so five times that is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. If we let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan has now, then:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find out how many toys Jonathan has now, we subtract 2 from 400:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Notebooks**: Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50.
   - So, \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)

2. **Pens**: He wants to buy 2 pens, and each pen costs $0.25.
   - So, \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)

3. **Calculator**: He wants to buy 1 calculator, and it costs $12.
   - So, \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)

4. **Geometry Set**: He wants to buy 1 geometry set, and it costs $10.
   - So, \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add all these amounts together:
- \(7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\)

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. So, we need to find 10% of $30.00:
- \(30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\)

He has 70 guests and wants to give each guest 2 bottles. So, he needs:

\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the bottles he already has from the total he needs:

\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

The answer is 92."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water.

First, let's find out how long it takes in warm water:
- Twice the time in cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes
- Adding 2 more minutes: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes

So, in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long it takes to swim 3 miles:
- In cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes
- In warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes

The difference in time between warm and cold water for 3 miles:
- \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final answer is 54 minutes."

\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Juan's doctor says he should drink 4 cups a day. So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups} \]

The answer is 16 cups."
"Okay, let's count the rodents step by step!

First, we have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each. So, we multiply 3 by 10:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]
This means there are 30 hamsters.

Next, we have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each. So, we multiply 3 by 5:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
This means there are 15 guinea pigs.

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents.

The final answer is 45."
"Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 × 130 = 260 pounds.

Now, let's add up their weights:
Mark: 150 pounds
Susan: 130 pounds
Bob: 260 pounds

Total weight = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends:
540 ÷ 3 = 180 pounds

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"The sun starts at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when it is at the tip of the pyramid. It moves 5 degrees every hour straight upward. If the sun moves for 10 hours, it will move \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees upward. So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

The final answer is \(\boxed{82}\) degrees."
"James has 2 sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

To find out how many candles James needs, we add the ages of his sons:
12 (for the first son) + 8 (for the second son) = 20 candles.

Each pack of candles has 5 candles, so we need to find out how many packs James needs to buy:
20 candles ÷ 5 candles per pack = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is:
4 packs × $3 per pack = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles. The answer is \boxed{12}."

   \[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

2. Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads per minute, we do:
   \[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

3. Now, we calculate how many pages she read in the first week:
   \[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

4. In the second week, she read 100 pages.

5. To find the total number of pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:
   \[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of them, which is 4 sandwiches (because 12 divided by 3 is 4). Trevor ate a quarter of them, which is 3 sandwiches (because 12 divided by 4 is 3). Together, they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. So, the number of sandwiches left is 12 - 7 = 5.

The answer is 5."
"Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old. At that time, he will be three times as old as his nephew.

Let's say his nephew is \( N \) years old now. In 7 years, his nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age (51) will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final answer: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half of $1.00, which is $0.50. So, for two teeth, that's \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's add it all up:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, Mark scored:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60 \text{ goals}
   \]
3. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, Anna scored:
   \[
   80 - 45 = 35 \text{ goals}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the goals:

"Liam said he made $63, and Mitchell said he sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. To find out how much Mitchell made, we multiply 21 by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, Mitchell made $84. Now, to find out how much more money Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Peter has $70 and wants to spend it equally over 7 days. From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $10 each day. So, for 4 days, he spends:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Each wooden action figure costs $5, so the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday to Saturday), each plastic action figure costs $2. So, the number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

"Ford grows 40 roses every week. He supplies roses to three flower shops. The first shop orders 20 roses, the second orders 15 roses, and the third orders 30 roses each week. 

First, let's find out how many roses he supplies in a week:
- First shop: 20 roses
- Second shop: 15 roses
- Third shop: 30 roses

So, in a week, he supplies:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses} \]

Now, let's see how many roses he grows in a month. We'll assume a month has 4 weeks:
\[ 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we calculate how many roses he needs to supply in a month:
\[ 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses} \]

Now, we find out how many roses he lacks:
\[ 260 \text{ roses} - 160 \text{ roses} = 100 \text{ roses} \]

So, Ford lacks \(\boxed{100}\) roses to supply all the flower shops every month."

"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up all the birds:
- Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

So, the total number of birds is:
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we need to divide the total number of birds by the number of days (7):
280 ÷ 7 = 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day.

The answer is 40."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Diane started with the number 20.
2. She added half of 20 to 20. Half of 20 is 10, so 20 + 10 = 30.
3. She then divided 30 by 5. 30 ÷ 5 = 6.
4. Finally, she multiplied 6 by the difference between 20 and 12. The difference is 20 - 12 = 8. So, 6 × 8 = 48.

"Maggie's oven is a bit off. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually gets to 468 degrees. That means it's 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after being 4% too hot.

To find this, we can use a simple calculation. We need to divide 520 by 1.04 (because 4% too hot means multiplying by 1.04).

So, we do:
\[ \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 500 degrees. The answer is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"Sure, let's figure out how long it will take Max to watch the two movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch both movies. The answer is:

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought \(24 + 20 = 44\) dishes.

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes:
- Total cups: \(12 + 40 = 52\)
- Total dishes: \(24 + 44 = 68\)

So, the total number of utensils brought by both is \(52 + 68 = 120\).

The answer is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts.
2. Each box costs $100.00, but there's a 10% discount.
3. The discount on one box is $100.00 × 10% = $10.00.
4. So, one box costs $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.
5. Two boxes will cost $90.00 × 2 = $180.00.
6. Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have 90 × 2 = 180 contacts.
7. The cost per contact is $180.00 ÷ 180 = $1.00.

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step!

First, we need to find out how many hours each person worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
So, Jill worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, let's calculate how much money each person earned. They get $10 for each hour they work.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.

Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

The final answer is: $40"
"Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. 

First, let's find out how many calories she burns from aerobics and running:
- Aerobics: 2 hours × 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories
- Running: 1 hour × 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, add the calories from both activities:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Next, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink:
- For every 200 calories, she needs 100 ml of water.
- So, for 1600 calories, she needs: (1600 calories ÷ 200 calories) × 100 ml = 8 × 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

1. We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500.
2. The note on the jar says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.
3. Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).
4. Then, the number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue).
5. And the number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).
6. The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans, so:
   \[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
7. Combining the terms, we get:
   \[ 3B = 4500 \]
8. Solving for \( B \):
   \[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]
9. Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
   - Red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
   - Green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)
10. The difference between green and red jelly beans is:

"John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. Each 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So, for 200 grams, we can calculate the protein like this:

1. First, find out how much protein is in 100 grams of mushrooms: 3 grams.
2. Since John eats 200 grams, we need to double the protein amount: \(3 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams}\).

So, John gets 6 grams of protein each day. Now, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams/week}\]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.
2. If we say Jerry is \( J \) years old now, then 5 years ago he was \( J - 5 \) years old.
3. According to the problem, \( J \) is twice \( J - 5 \). So, we can write:
   \[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]
4. Now, let's solve this:
   \[ J = 2J - 10 \]
5. If we move \( 2J \) to the left side, we get:
   \[ J - 2J = -10 \]
6. This simplifies to:
   \[ -J = -10 \]
7. If we multiply both sides by -1, we get:
   \[ J = 10 \]
8. So, Jerry is 10 years old now.
9. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
   \[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be \(\boxed{13}\) years old in 3 years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the total cost for the implants is:
   \[
   2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, we add this to the total:
   \[
   4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. George has already paid $600 as a deposit. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
   \[
   4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. George earns $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide $3900 by $15:
   \[

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's say the smallest angle is \(x\). According to the problem:
- One angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\).
- Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

So, the sum of the angles in the triangle is:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, we can find the other angles:
- The angle that is twice the smallest angle is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees.
- The angle that is three times the smallest angle is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

Colby has:
- 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is worth 5 nickels, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth 2 nickels, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so that's 14 nickels.
- 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is worth 5 pennies, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add all the nickels together:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**

"Okay, let's count the legs of the pets in the store step by step.

1. Dogs: There are 5 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. So, \(5 \times 4 = 20\) legs.
2. Cats: There are 2 cats, and each cat has 4 legs. So, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs.
3. Birds: There are 10 birds, and each bird has 2 legs. So, \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Now, let's add all the legs together:
\[20 \text{ (dog legs)} + 8 \text{ (cat legs)} + 20 \text{ (bird legs)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He makes it heavier by 50%, so we need to find 50% of 8 and add it to 8.

50% of 8 is 4 (because 8 divided by 2 is 4).

So, 8 pounds plus 4 pounds is 12 pounds.

But 12 pounds is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds.

12 pounds minus 2 pounds is 10 pounds.

So, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."

2. **First Year:**
   - He buys 1 game each month for 12 months.
   - So, \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.

3. **Second Year:**
   - He buys 2 games each month for 12 months.
   - So, \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.

4. **Third Year:**
   - He buys 4 games each month for 12 months.
   - So, \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

5. **Christmas Games:**
   - He gets 5 games each Christmas for 3 years.
   - So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) games.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Birthday games: 5
- First year games: 12
- Second year games: 24
- Third year games: 48
- Christmas games: 15

Total games: \(5 + 12 + 24 + 48 + 15 = 104\)

So, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 104."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find out how fast the plane is flying. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, we divide 1200 miles by 3 hours to find the speed:

\[ \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the plane flies at 400 miles per hour. Next, we need to find out how long it will take to fly an additional 2000 miles. We use the speed we just found:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 5 more hours to travel an additional 2000 miles.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\) hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, in 1 hour, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much as Ruiz in 1 hour. So, Marissa can make:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds in 2 hours}
   \]
   Therefore, in 1 hour, Marissa can make:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. If they work for 12 hours:
   - Ruiz can make:
     \[
     60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Marissa can make:
     \[
     45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. Together, they can make:
   \[
   720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is \(\boxed{1260}\)."
"Howard spends money at the arcade over three days. Let's see how much he spends each day and how much he has left.

On Monday, he spends $8.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spends:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. So, the money he has left is:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. For the first 4 hours:
   - Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
   - Each cup was sold for $0.50.
   - So, in one hour, he earned 15 * $0.50 = $7.50.
   - For 4 hours, he earned 4 * $7.50 = $30.

2. For the next 2 hours:
   - Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
   - Each cup was sold for $0.60.
   - So, in one hour, he earned 10 * $0.60 = $6.00.
   - For 2 hours, he earned 2 * $6.00 = $12.

3. Now, let's add the money he earned from both times:
   - Total money earned = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Find out how many rotations happen in a month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - So, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400}{2} \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Find out how many rotations happen in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, the number of rotations in a year is:
     \[
     145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Find out how many years the tire can last:**
   - Each tire can rotate 10,440,000 times.
   - So, the number of years the tire can last is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

So, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The big bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
2. It says 2 pumps give you 120 washes.
3. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to find out how many washes 1 pump gives:
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washes, 1 pump will give half of that, which is 60 washes.
4. Now, we need to find out how much each washing costs:
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and gives 120 washes, so each wash costs $24.00 ÷ 120 = $0.20.
5. Since 1 pump gives 60 washes, the cost for 60 washes is:
   - 60 washes × $0.20 per wash = $12.00.
6. Finally, we need to convert $12.00 to cents:
   - $12.00 = 1200 cents.

So, the cost per pump is 1200 cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy clothes. There's a 30% discount on the shirt, which costs $25. The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there's no discount, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe only has $50, so he doesn't have enough money to buy both items. He will not have any money left and will be short by:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

So, the answer is that Joe will have:
\[ \boxed{0} \]
Joe will have no money left."
"Juan wants to make croissants. He plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. To find out how many dozens he will make in a week, we multiply 4 by 7:

\[ 4 \times 7 = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Now, we know that making 1 dozen croissants needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter. So, to find out how much butter he needs for 28 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 by \(\frac{1}{4}\):

\[ 28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter.
- So, the total cost for Monica's street is 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100.

Next, let's find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- It also costs $194 per meter.
- So, the total cost for Lewis' street is 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060.

Now, we need to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street:
- The difference in cost is $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

The final answer is: $65,960."
"John is working on a program to find cancer cells. He gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. After that, it takes 10 times longer, so that's 45 months in total. The first 5 months cost $100,000 each, so for 5 months it's:

\[ 100,000 \times 5 = 500,000 \]

For the next 5 months, the cost is 50% more, so it's:

\[ 100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000 \]

For 5 months at $150,000 each, it's:

\[ 150,000 \times 5 = 750,000 \]

So, the total cost is:

\[ 500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000 \]

The total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each tip is 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players had vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

So, \(6 + 8 + 16 = 30\) ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many days are in March. March has 31 days.
2. Each person in the group posts 3 times a day.
3. There are 1000 people in the group.
4. So, each day, the group makes \(1000 \times 3 = 3000\) posts.
5. To find out how many posts are made in March, we multiply the daily posts by the number of days in March: \(3000 \times 31 = 93000\).

So, the total number of posts in March is \(93000\)."
"Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, and water costs $0.15 per gallon.

First, we find out how much water Gary uses each week:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Next, we find out how much water he uses in a year:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the water used in a year:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year."
"Sure, let's add up all the things Scarlett bought:

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each, so \(2 \times 2.50 = 5.00\)
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each, so \(3 \times 2.00 = 6.00\)
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each, so \(20 \times 0.50 = 10.00\)
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add all these up:
\[10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00\]

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00.

The final answer is: \boxed{33.00}"
"After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. In the second week, it grew to double that height, so it became 6 inches tall. In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, making it 10 inches tall.

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks."
"Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day. So, in one day, he sells:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Bill gives Prince a bull that weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight of the meat by the amount he sells each day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So, we multiply 4 by 18:
   \[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]
   So, there are 72 seats in total.

2. Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by them. So, we divide 72 by 4:
   \[ \frac{72}{4} = 18 \]
   So, 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.

3. Now, we need to find out how many seats are left after the administrators took their seats. We subtract the 18 seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats:
   \[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]
   So, 54 seats are left.

4. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, we divide 54 by 3:
   \[ \frac{54}{3} = 18 \]
   So, 18 seats were occupied by the parents.

5. The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. We subtract the 18 seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
   \[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]
   So, 36 seats were occupied by the students.

Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Each pole has 4 street lights.
2. There are 6 poles at each intersection.
3. So, at one intersection, the number of street lights is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).
4. There are 4 intersections, so the total number of street lights is \(24 \times 4 = 96\).
5. If 20 street lights are not working, then the number of functioning street lights is \(96 - 20 = 76\).

So, the total number of functioning street lights is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. The first DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. It has already been played 356 times. So, the remaining times it can be played are:
   \[
   1000 - 356 = 644
   \]

2. The second DVD can also be played 1000 times before it breaks. It has already been played 135 times. So, the remaining times it can be played are:
   \[
   1000 - 135 = 865
   \]

3. Now, we add the remaining play times of both DVDs to find out how many times they can be played in total:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509
   \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is:
\[
\boxed{1509}

"John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours each time. So, each week he spent \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours in therapy. Over 6 weeks, he spent \(6 \times 4 = 24\) hours in total.

The cost per hour is $125. So, the total cost is \(24 \times 125 = 3000\) dollars.

The total cost of John's physical therapy is \(\boxed{3000}\)."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours at school. Since his school day is 8 hours long, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, the total cost for the baseballs is:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, the total cost for the basketballs is:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract the cost of the baseballs from the cost of the basketballs:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the basketball coach spent \(\boxed{85}\) dollars more than the baseball coach."
"Arianna has a garden with 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Now, we know that \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out together!

First, we know Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. We need to find out how many Mb she can download in one hour.

1. We know that 1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb.
2. So, 20 kb is a small part of 1 Mb. To find out how many Mb 20 kb is, we divide 20 by 1000:
   \[
   \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb per second}
   \]

3. Now, we need to know how many seconds are in one hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:
   \[
   60 \times 60 = 3600 \, \text{seconds in one hour}
   \]

4. To find out how many Mb Ashley can download in one hour, we multiply the speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
   \[
   0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \, \text{Mb per hour}
   \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour. The answer is \(\boxed{72}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **First Three Days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - So, for three days, it would be \(10 \times 3 = 30\) cars.

2. **Remaining Four Days:**
   - On the remaining four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day.
   - So, it pulled \(10 - 4 = 6\) cars each day.
   - For four days, it would be \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cars.

3. **Total Cars:**
   - Now, we add the cars from the first three days and the remaining four days.
   - So, \(30 + 24 = 54\) cars.

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is \(\boxed{54}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Adam is 40 inches tall now.
2. We need to know how many feet that is. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
   \[
   40 \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. To ride the roller coaster, Adam needs to be 4 feet tall.
4. The difference in height is:
   \[
   4 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}
   \]
5. Adam grows 2 inches every year. We need to convert this to feet:
   \[
   2 \div 12 = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet per year}
   \]
6. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \div \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Adam needs 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. James sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000.
   - So, the total money he got from selling the cars is \(10 \times 25,000 = 250,000\).

2. The company paid 30% of the price to get each car.
   - So, the cost to get each car is \(25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500\).
   - For 10 cars, the total cost is \(10 \times 7,500 = 75,000\).

3. The profit is the total money from selling the cars minus the total cost to get the cars.
   - So, the profit is \(250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000\).

4. James gets 10% of the profit as his commission.
   - So, his commission is \(175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500\).

Therefore, the amount James made is \(\boxed{17500}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 100 surfers in total.
2. Only 25% of them can stay on the big wave without falling. So, we need to find 25% of 100:
   \[
   100 \times 0.25 = 25
   \]
   So, 25 surfers can stay on the wave.

3. Of these 25 surfers, 60% are women. This means 40% are men. So, we need to find 40% of 25:
   \[
   25 \times 0.40 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 men can stay on the wave.

The final answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]
4. Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
   \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"Max bought some stamps at the post office. He bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. To find the total number of stamps, we add them all up: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45. So, Max bought 45 stamps in all.

The answer is 45."
"Sure, let's think about this step by step.

Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. Tom is driving faster than Bob. Tom drives at 70 miles per hour, and Bob drives at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour

This means Tom is getting closer to Bob at a rate of 15 miles every hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we need to find out how many hours it will take for Tom to cover those 75 miles at the rate of 15 miles per hour.

So, we divide the distance by the speed Tom is closing the gap:

75 ÷ 15 = 5 hours

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so:
   \[
   17 - 6 = 11
   \]
   Darren caught 11 fish.
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so:
   \[
   11 + 3 = 14
   \]
   Tommy caught 14 fish.

So, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents said if the classes cost more than $10 each, they won't sign him up again. There are 10 classes in total.

To find out how many classes Manny can miss, we need to figure out how many classes he has to attend so that each class doesn't cost more than $10.

If he misses \(x\) classes, he will attend \(10 - x\) classes. The cost per class will be \(\frac{60}{10 - x}\).

We need this to be less than or equal to $10:
\[
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
\]

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by \(10 - x\):
\[
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
60 \leq 100 - 10x
\]

Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[
-40 \leq -10x
\]

Divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[
4 \geq x
\]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. Jewel processes 50 customers a day. So, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers a day.

Together, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers a day.

Since they work 7 days a week, they process \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers in a week.

So, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[
\boxed{1050}
\]"
"Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

The answer is 17 miles."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much one apple costs. If 4 apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
   \[
   \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, we find out how much one orange costs. If 3 oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
   \[
   \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we calculate the cost for 5 apples:
   \[
   5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Then, we calculate the cost for 5 oranges:
   \[
   5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to find the total cost:
   \[
   6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to know how much earth he has to shovel. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply:

\[ 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"Sure, let's add up the costs step by step:

1. The base price of the truck is $30,000.
2. The king cab upgrade costs $7,500.
3. The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab, so that's $7,500 ÷ 3 = $2,500.
4. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so that's $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
5. The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, let's add all these together:

$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (light package) = $43,500.

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Tim got a new job with a raise. His old job paid him $20,000 a month. Now, he gets a 5% raise, so we need to find out what 5% of $20,000 is. 

5% of $20,000 is:
\[ 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

But that's not all! He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. Half of $21,000 is:
\[ \frac{21000}{2} = 10500 \]

So, his new monthly salary with the bonus is:
\[ 21000 + 10500 = 31500 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly salary by 12:
\[ 31500 \times 12 = 378000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year.

The answer is: $378,000."
"James buys a new wardrobe. He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants. He also buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. 

- Each suit costs $750, so 10 suits cost \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.
- Each dress pant costs \(750 \div 5 = 150\) dollars, so 10 dress pants cost \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.
- Each dress shirt costs $60, and since he buys 3 shirts for each of the 10 suits, he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) shirts. So, 30 shirts cost \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Adding all these up:
- Suits: $7500
- Dress pants: $1500
- Dress shirts: $1800

Total cost: \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

So, the total cost is \(\boxed{10800}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's figure this out together!

The first website makes 20 news articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we can find out how many articles they make in February by multiplying 20 by 28. 

\[ 20 \times 28 = 560 \]

The second website makes 10 business news articles every day. Again, since February has 28 days, we can find out how many articles they make in February by multiplying 10 by 28.

\[ 10 \times 28 = 280 \]

Now, to find the total number of articles both websites make together in February, we add the two numbers we just found.

\[ 560 + 280 = 840 \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is:

\[ \boxed{840} \]"
"Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older, so she is 64 years old. Their son is half as old as his mom, so he is 32 years old. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than him, so she is 29 years old.

The answer is 29."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms.
2. To find out how much flour is in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:
   \[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]
3. Now, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since one bag has 16 kilograms, we multiply that by 3:
   \[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is \(\boxed{48}\) kilograms."
"Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find out how many miles she biked, we multiply her speed by the time she biked:
\[ 12 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. To find out how many miles he biked, we multiply his speed by the time he biked:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2.5 \text{ hours} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total miles biked by both Alisa and Stanley, we add the miles they each biked:
\[ 54 \text{ miles} + 25 \text{ miles} = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is:
\[ 79 \text{ miles} \]"
"Bill is digging a well. He can dig 4 feet in one hour through soil. He has 24 feet of soil to dig through. So, it will take him \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

For the clay, he digs half as fast as through soil. So, he digs \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \) through clay. He has 8 feet of clay to dig through. So, it will take him \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

To find the total time, we add the time for soil and clay: \( 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \).

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."
"Howie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class, including himself and his teacher. He thinks people might want vanilla or chocolate cupcakes, so he decides to get one of each for everyone. He has 25 classmates, so in total, he needs to buy cupcakes for:

- Himself: 1
- His teacher: 1
- His classmates: 25

That makes 27 people in total. Each person will get 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). So, the total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy is:

27 people × 2 cupcakes per person = 54 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Fishio started with 2000 likes.
2. After three weeks, she had 70 times the initial likes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she got 20000 more likes. So, we add this to the 140000 likes:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of likes is 160000. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{160000}
\]"
"Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday. So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara is:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

The next day, the price of pomegranates shot up to $30 each. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates, so the initial cost is:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final cost for Sheila is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Ariadne sells hats in her shop. In one month, she made $400 from selling red hats. This amount is half of what she made from selling green hats. So, she made $400 * 2 = $800 from selling green hats in that month.

The total amount she made in the first month is the sum of what she made from red and green hats, which is $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, she made \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month. So, she made \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

To find out how much she made in total over the two months, we add the amounts from both months: $1200 + $900 = $2100.

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2100}

"James hires a carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so each of the next two hours costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's add up the cost:
- First hour: $15
- Next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

So, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

James paid \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Sally's bank account went from $200 to $420 this week. She didn't get any other money, so the extra $220 must be from her wage. Her wage should be $300, but she only has $220. So, the money that was taken away from her wage is $300 - $220 = $80.

The amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"Lori is making deviled eggs for her party. Each guest will eat 3 halves of a deviled egg, and she is inviting 16 guests. So, the total number of egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Lori will need \(\boxed{2}\) dozens of eggs."
"Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She has already written one-third of it. To find out how many pages she has left, we can do the following:

1. First, we calculate how many pages she has already written:

"Mike has a 200-page book to read. He plans to read 10 pages each day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day.

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading in 20 days. Since the assignment is due in 30 days, he will finish 10 days before the deadline.

10 days"
"James buys a plane for $150,000. He pays $5,000 a month to rent a hanger and spends twice as much on fuel each month. 

First, let's find out how much he spends on fuel each month:
- He spends $5,000 on the hanger.
- He spends twice that on fuel, so $5,000 x 2 = $10,000 on fuel.

Now, let's find out his total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = cost of hanger + cost of fuel = $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.

Next, we need to find out how much he spends in a year:
- There are 12 months in a year, so $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

Finally, we add the initial cost of the plane to the yearly maintenance cost:
- Initial cost of the plane = $150,000.
- Yearly maintenance cost = $180,000.
- Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

So, the total cost for the first year is $330,000."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - So, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - So, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

First, we need to find out how much 1/2 pound of almonds costs. Since a pound of almonds costs $10, 1/2 pound will cost:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 1/3 pound of walnuts costs. Since a pound of walnuts costs $15, 1/3 pound will cost:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out the cost for the second mixture. For 1/5 pound of almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

And for 1/3 pound of walnuts, we already know it's $5.

So, the total cost for the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we need to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
- There are 20 heads in total.
- There are 70 legs in total.

Let's say:
- \( S \) is the number of sheep.
- \( G \) is the number of geese.

From the heads, we know:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

From the legs, we know:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the legs equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To find \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( \boxed{15} \)."
"Roger wants to buy coffee and a donut. The coffee he usually buys costs $5 per pound, but now he has to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

First, let's find out how much the new coffee costs:
- 20% of $5 is \(5 \times 0.20 = 1\) dollar.
- So, the new coffee costs \(5 + 1 = 6\) dollars per pound.

Roger needs coffee for a week, and he uses 1 pound per day. That means he needs 7 pounds of coffee:
- 7 pounds of the new coffee will cost \(7 \times 6 = 42\) dollars.

He also buys a donut for $2.

So, the total cost is:
- Coffee: $42
- Donut: $2
- Total: \(42 + 2 = 44\) dollars.

The final answer is \(\boxed{44}\)."
"Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

First, let's add up the cost of the chips:
2 bags of chips × $2.00 each = $4.00

Next, add the cost of the fried chicken:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) = $12.00

Then, add the cost of the soda:
$12.00 + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Now, subtract the total cost of the chips, chicken, and soda from the total amount Gus spent:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.

The answer is: $7.00"
"James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day. He delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C. To find out how many newspapers he delivers to District B, we need to subtract the newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total.

So, we do:
600 (total newspapers) - 198 (District A) - 209 (District C)

Let's do the math:
600 - 198 = 402
402 - 209 = 193

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

The answer is 193."

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 150 teachers on the basketball court.
2. 60% of these teachers are history teachers. To find out how many that is, we do:
   \[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \]
   So, there are 90 history teachers.
3. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find out how many math teachers there are, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
   \[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]
   So, there are 60 math teachers.
4. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep together, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each sleeps:

"Christina recorded her mood for 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Her first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Let's count the good days:
- First 8 days were good.
- Next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, so 2 more good days.

So, the total good days are:
8 (first 8 days) + 2 (next 3 days) = 10 good days.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

We know that Janey has 21 books. The problem says that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. 

Let's say Sally has \( S \) books. Then, Janey has \( 2S + 3 \) books.

Since Janey has 21 books, we can write:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \):
1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
2. Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bamboo is currently 20 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we need to convert 20 feet to inches:
   \[
   20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The target height is 600 inches. So, we need to find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow:
   \[
   600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide 360 by 30:
   \[
   \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

\[
\boxed{12}

"James needs to get more toys for his doggie shelter. Each dog needs one toy.

1. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs, so now there are \(4 + 8 = 12\) dogs.
3. James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

After buying the toys, there are twice as many dogs as before:
4. The number of dogs doubles, so now there are \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dogs.
5. James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs leave:
6. The number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
7. James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer: 20**"

"If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns 96 potatoes can make by setting it up like this:

First, we see that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. So, for 96 potatoes, we can set up a simple multiplication:

\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

This means that 96 potatoes are 16 times the amount of 6 potatoes. Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we multiply 36 by 16:

\[ 36 \times 16 = 576 \]

So, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

The answer is 576."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out the total weight of the 8 adults. Each adult weighs 80 kg, so:
   \[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

2. Now, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults. Jack also weighs 80 kg, so:
   \[ 640 + 80 = 720 \text{ kg} \]

3. The elevator can only hold up to 700 kg. So, we need to see how much more they have than the limit:
   \[ 720 - 700 = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

The answer is 20 kg."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Total cookies = \(68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\)

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Shania is making a dress longer. She makes it 50% longer and then adds 20 cm of lace. The final dress is 140 cm long.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. If the dress is 50% longer, it means the new length is 150% of the original length.
2. So, if the original length is \( x \) cm, the new length before adding the lace is \( 1.5x \) cm.
3. Then she adds 20 cm of lace, so the total length is \( 1.5x + 20 \) cm.
4. We know the final length is 140 cm, so we can write the equation: \( 1.5x + 20 = 140 \).
5. To find \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides: \( 1.5x = 120 \).
6. Then we divide both sides by 1.5: \( x = 80 \).

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The answer is: \(\boxed{80}\)"

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets.
2. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
3. The combined ages of one twin and one triplet is 44.

Let's say the age of the triplet is \( T \) and the age of the twin is \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( W = T + 7 \)
- \( W + T = 44 \)

Now, let's put the first equation into the second one:
- \( (T + 7) + T = 44 \)
- \( 2T + 7 = 44 \)

Subtract 7 from both sides:
- \( 2T = 37 \)

Divide both sides by 2:
- \( T = 18.5 \)

Now, we know the triplet is 18.5 years old. So, the twin's age is:
- \( W = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \)

So, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."
"John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner. First, we need to change that to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

So, John has \(\boxed{100}\) minutes to nap."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

First, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. So, for 10 lollipops, the cost would be:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

Next, we know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 1 candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]

Now, for 10 candies, the cost would be:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the lollipops and the candies together:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
   \[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

2. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's say the total bill is \( x \) dollars. So, the cost of the heartworm check is:
   \[ 0.6x \]

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

4. To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
   \[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
   \[ 0.4x = 40 \]
   \[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
   \[ x = 100 \]

5. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - So, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - So, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's figure out how many squares are in Brittany's quilted comforter step by step.

1. **Red Squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue Squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18 \text{ blue squares}
   \]
3. **Green Squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24 \text{ green squares}
   \]
4. **White Squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12 \text{ white squares}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know there are 8 high chairs.
2. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, we multiply 8 by 5:
   \[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
   This means there are 40 regular chairs.
3. Now, we add the high chairs and regular chairs to find out how many chairs are there in total:
   \[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]
   So, there are 48 chairs in total.
4. For the function, we need chairs for 42 adults and 15 babies. So, we add these numbers:
   \[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]
   This means we need 57 chairs in total.
5. To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs we already have from the number of chairs needed:
   \[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know there are 50 deer in the field.
2. We are told that 50 percent of these deer are bucks. So, we need to find 50 percent of 50.
3. To find 50 percent of 50, we can do \(50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \times 0.5 = 25\). So, there are 25 bucks.
4. Next, we are told that 20 percent of these bucks are 8 points. So, we need to find 20 percent of 25.
5. To find 20 percent of 25, we can do \(25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.2 = 5\).

So, the number of 8 point bucks is 5.

The final answer is 5."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Adam has 50 points.
2. Betty has 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate 30% of 50 and add it to 50:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]
3. Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, we subtract 30 from 65:
   \[
   65 - 30 = 35 \text{ points}
   \]
4. Marta has 3 times the points of Tom. So, we multiply 35 by 3:
   \[
   35 \times 3 = 105 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the points:
\[
50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \text{ points}
\]

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. So, we subtract the points they have from 400:

So, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts half of it into her retirement account, which is:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account. Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment, which is:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

So, she uses $480 for her car payment. Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amounts she spent from her total paycheck:

\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is:

"Sure, let's figure this out together!

Erin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream. The ice cream parlor has a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's see how much 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free) cost:
- 2 scoops cost \(2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00\)
- So, 3 scoops cost \$3.00.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can buy with $6.00:
- \( \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00} = 2 \text{ sets} \)

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
- \(2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops}\)

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

**Final Answer:**

"Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's see how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces in two weeks.

Now, let's see how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces in two weeks.

Next, we calculate how much candy each has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- So, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

"Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. He needs 24 tiles for every square foot. His bathroom is 36 square feet, but he only wants to cover two-thirds of it. 

First, we find out how much area he wants to cover:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, since he needs 24 tiles for each square foot, we calculate the total number of tiles:
\[ 24 \, \text{square feet} \times 24 \, \text{tiles per square foot} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden needs 576 tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.

The answer is: \boxed{576}"
"James went to pick blueberries. It cost him $20 to go there and $1.5 for each pound of blueberries. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. 

First, we need to find out how much it cost him to pick the blueberries. He paid $20 to go and $1.5 for each pound. So for 30 pounds, it would be:
\[ 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]
Adding the initial cost:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \]
So, it cost him $65 to pick the blueberries.

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost him to buy the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries for $2.5 per pound. So for 30 pounds, it would be:
\[ 2.5 \times 30 = 75 \]
So, it would cost him $75 to buy the blueberries at the store.

Now, we need to find out how much he saved by picking the blueberries instead of buying them. We subtract the cost of picking from the cost of buying:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]
So, James saved $10.

The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The company planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each.
2. But the price went up by 10%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 10% of $700.
   - 10% of $700 is $70 (because 10% is the same as multiplying by 0.10, so $700 * 0.10 = $70).
3. So, the new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770.
4. Now, to find the total cost for 500 computers at $770 each, we multiply $770 by 500.
   - $770 * 500 = $385,000.

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000.

The answer is: \boxed{385000}"
"Okay, let's count the calories step by step:

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs. Each egg has 75 calories.
   - So, \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories from eggs.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 ounces of cheese. Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
   - So, \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories from cheese.

3. **Ham**: John uses 2 ounces of ham. Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
   - So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories from ham.

Now, let's add all the calories together:
- Total calories = 450 (from eggs) + 240 (from cheese) + 80 (from ham)
- Total calories = 770

So, the omelet has 770 calories."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Helga taps her right foot 300 times per minute when her arms are down.
2. She taps her left foot 250 times per minute when her arms are down.
3. When her arms are raised, she taps each foot 200 times per minute.

Now, let's calculate the taps:

- For 3 minutes with her arms down:
  - Right foot: \(300 \times 3 = 900\) taps
  - Left foot: \(250 \times 3 = 750\) taps

- For 2 minutes with her arms raised:
  - Right foot: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) taps
  - Left foot: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) taps

Now, let's add them up:

- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we add the right and left foot taps together:

- Total taps: \(1300 + 1150 = 2450\)

So, the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"Ron has a pothole in front of his house. If the city doesn't fix it, it could cost him $450 to fix his car. But if he fixes it himself, the city will fine him $120 and he needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that cost $25 each.

First, let's find out how much it will cost Ron if he fixes the pothole himself:
- Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets × $25 per bucket = $75
- Fine for fixing the pothole: $120
- Total cost: $75 + $120 = $195

Now, let's see how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself:
- Potential damage to his car: $450
- Cost of fixing the pothole: $195
- Savings: $450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

The answer is: $255"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.
2. 20 normal chairs were sent for repair, so we subtract 20 from 170:
   \[
   170 - 20 = 150
   \]
   So, there are 150 normal chairs left.
3. 13 baby chairs were sent for repair, so we subtract 13 from 23:
   \[
   23 - 13 = 10
   \]
   So, there are 10 baby chairs left.
4. Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together:
   \[
   150 + 10 = 160
   \]

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left. The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza there are in total. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
   \[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

2. Next, we need to figure out how many slices Bryce and his two friends ate. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
   So, the three friends together ate:
   \[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many slices the other two friends ate. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
   So, the two friends together ate:
   \[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

4. Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
   \[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

5. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
   \[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages.
2. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   This means the dog takes 20 minutes to eat the same 9 sausages.

3. Now, to find the average time, we add the times together and divide by 2:
   \[
   \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.

The answer is: \(\boxed{25}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to know how long Topher's shoe is in inches. The problem says Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches:

\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Now, add the 4 inches:

\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

The problem also says that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. If we let the length of Bobby's shoe be \( x \) inches, then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( \boxed{10} \) inches."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Students' Cars:**
   - There are 64 students' cars.
   - Each car has 4 windows.
   - Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in students' cars is \(64 \times 4 = 256\).
   - A quarter of 256 is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \).

2. **Teachers' Cars:**
   - There are 32 teachers' cars.
   - Each car has 2 windows.
   - Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
   - So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is \(32 \times 2 = 64\).
   - Three-quarters of 64 is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \).

3. **Total Windows Smashed:**
   - Add the windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars.
   - \(64 + 48 = 112\).

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is \( \boxed{112} \)."

First, we need to know how many spools of thread Candy has in total. She has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

To find the total number of spools, we add these numbers together:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. She has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools

So, the total number of blue spools is:
15 + 45 = 60

Now, to find out what percentage of her spools are blue, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.

The final answer is:

So, Parker will need \(\boxed{8}\) packs of gum to last him 30 days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each sleeve of graham crackers can make 8 large smores.
2. There are 3 sleeves in a box.
3. 9 kids want 2 smores each, so that's \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
4. 6 adults want 1 smore each, so that's \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
5. Total smores needed = \(18 + 6 = 24\).
6. To find out how many sleeves are needed, we divide the total smores by the smores each sleeve can make: \(24 \div 8 = 3\) sleeves.
7. Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we need \(3 \div 3 = 1\) box.

So, they will need \(\boxed{1}\) box of graham crackers."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
   \]

2. Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A. So, we need to find 50% more than 20:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{50}{100} \times 20 = 10
   \]
   Adding this to candidate A's votes:
   \[
   20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
   \]

3. The rest of the votes went to candidate C. So, we subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

Now, he sells 500 tomatoes a day, so his daily savings are:
$0.1 * 500 = $50

There are 7 days in a week, so his weekly savings are:
$50 * 7 = $350

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we know Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we multiply Sean's marbles by 4:
   \[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \]
   So, Carl has 224 marbles.
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, to find out how many marbles Cal has, we multiply Sean's marbles by 2:
   \[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \]
   So, Cal has 112 marbles.
4. Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:
   \[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is 336.

The final answer is: \boxed{336}"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 54 students in total.
2. We need to divide these students into 6 equal groups.
3. So, each group will have \( \frac{54}{6} = 9 \) students.
4. Now, the activity requires 12 groups.
5. To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the groups we already have from the total required groups: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \).

So, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Weekends:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - So, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total in one 4-week month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total in two 4-week months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The total electricity bill each month is $100.
2. There are 5 people sharing the bill (Jenna and her 4 roommates).
3. To find out how much each person pays each month, we divide the total bill by the number of people:
   \[
   \text{Monthly share} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Now, to find out how much each person pays in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
   \[
   \text{Annual share} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, she trades \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers. Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. So, she trades \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers. Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

She has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons from the remaining large stickers.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has:
- Small buttons: 27
- Large buttons: 20
- Small buttons from large stickers: 60

Total buttons = \(27 + 20 + 60 = 107\).

"Okay, let's solve this together! Imagine there's a group of 33 people who are voting on a new rule. The rule passed, and there were twice as many people who said ""yes"" compared to those who said ""no"".

Let's say the number of people who said ""no"" is \( x \). Then, the number of people who said ""yes"" would be \( 2x \) because it's twice as many.

Now, if we add the ""yes"" votes and the ""no"" votes together, it should equal the total number of people, which is 33. So, we can write it as:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of people who said ""no"" is 11. Since the number of ""yes"" votes is twice that, we have:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - So, \(2 \times 11 = 22\) students need size small.

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - So, \(22 - 4 = 18\) students need size medium.

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) students need size large.

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - So, \(9 + 6 = 15\) students need size extra-large.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Extra-small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts = \(11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75\)

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we find out how many people think horse #2 will win. We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. So, we calculate:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \text{ people}
   \]

2. Now, we need to find out how many people are left after those who think horse #2 will win:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people}
   \]

3. Next, we find out how many of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. So, we calculate:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \text{ people}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
2. If one third of the Pomeranians are girls, then the total number of Pomeranians is 3 times the number of Pomeranian girls.
3. So, the total number of Pomeranians is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

Now, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and we have 18 Pomeranians.
4. If two thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, then the total number of puppies is 1.5 times the number of Pomeranians (because \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total is 18, so the whole is \( 18 \div \frac{2}{3} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \)).

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

1. We know the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
2. Let's say the first house needs \( x \) cases.
3. The second house needs \( 2x \) cases (twice as much as the first house).
4. The third house needs \( 2x \) cases (twice as much as the first house).

So, the total cases can be written as:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

First, let's find 45% of 200:
45% of 200 = 0.45 * 200 = 90

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Since he has 200 bananas, he has:
200 + 90 = 290 pears

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the number of pears and bananas:
290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies.
2. A third of these movies are in series. So, \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) movies are in series.
3. Each series movie costs $6, so \( 200 \times 6 = 1200 \) dollars for the series movies.
4. The remaining movies are \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).
5. 40% of these remaining movies are older movies. So, \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \) older movies.
6. Each older movie costs $5, so \( 160 \times 5 = 800 \) dollars for the older movies.
7. The rest of the movies are normal movies. So, \( 400 - 160 = 240 \) normal movies.
8. Each normal movie costs $10, so \( 240 \times 10 = 2400 \) dollars for the normal movies.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
2. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
3. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now, let's calculate the points:

- For enemies: Ava gets 10 points for each enemy, so if Emma jumps on \(E_e\) enemies, Ava jumps on \(E_e + 8\) enemies. So, Ava gets \(10 \times (E_e + 8) = 10E_e + 80\) points from enemies.
- For berries: Ava gets 5 points for each berry, so if Emma collects \(E_b\) berries, Ava collects \(E_b + 3\) berries. So, Ava gets \(5 \times (E_b + 3) = 5E_b + 15\) points from berries.
- For time: Ava gets 30 points for each second left on the timer, so if Emma has \(E_t\) seconds left, Ava has \(E_t + 4\) seconds left. So, Ava gets \(30 \times (E_t + 4) = 30E_t + 120\) points from time.

Now, let's add up all the points for Ava:
\[ 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

Emma's total points are:
\[ 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) = 215 \]

So, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 together.
3. So, the cost of the other two pizzas is $64 - $30 = $34.
4. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2.
5. $34 ÷ 2 = $17.

So, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.

The answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much, so that's:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding both parts together:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.
2. He bought some more fish from the pet store, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
3. Let's say he bought \(O\) orange fish and \(W\) white fish.
4. So, after buying, he has \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish.
5. According to the problem, \(3 + O = 2 \times (4 + W)\).

Now, let's solve this:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Also, we know he bought a total of 17 fish:
\[O + W = 17\]

From \(O + W = 17\), we can say:
\[O = 17 - W\]

Now, substitute \(O = 17 - W\) into \(O - 2W = 5\):
\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]
\[17 - 3W = 5\]
\[-3W = 5 - 17\]
\[-3W = -12\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish.

The answer is: \(\boxed{4}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Andy drives 5 miles one way to work.
2. So, a round trip is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles.
3. Andy works 5 days a week, so he drives 10 miles * 5 = 50 miles in a week.
4. His car uses 10 miles per gallon of gas.
5. So, he uses 50 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 5 gallons of gas in a week.
6. The gas costs $3 per gallon.
7. So, he spends 5 gallons * $3 = $15 on gas each week.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Carrie got ten twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. 

First, let's find out how much money she got from the twenties:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much money she got from the quarters:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she got is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Carrie spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters. 

The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:

"Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

To find out how many fruits he gets, we need to do some simple math.

For tomatoes:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

For eggplants:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the tomatoes and eggplants together:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

So, Ricardo gets 142 fruits from his plants.

The answer is: \boxed{142}"
"Samwell's store sold TVs this week. Out of 40 TVs sold, one-fourth were smart TVs and one-eighth were analog TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how many smart TVs were sold:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]
So, 10 smart TVs were sold.

Next, let's find out how many analog TVs were sold:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]
So, 5 analog TVs were sold.

Now, to find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total number of TVs sold:
\[ 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is:

"John is raising money for a school trip. The trip costs $300, and the school will cover half of that cost. So, the school will give John $150. John already has $50. 

To find out how much more John needs, we add what he has and what the school will give:
\[ 50 + 150 = 200 \]

The total cost of the trip is $300, so the amount John still needs is:
\[ 300 - 200 = 100 \]

So, John is missing $100. 

The answer is: \(\boxed{100}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. During the day, it was 45 degrees.
2. At night, it's 33 degrees colder than during the day, so we subtract 33 from 45:
   \[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]
3. The pipes will freeze if the temperature is below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees:
   \[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]
4. Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide 20 by 5:
   \[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn \(\boxed{4}\) logs to prevent the pipes from freezing."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 90 people and each group has 9 people. So, we divide 90 by 9 to find out how many groups there are:
   \[
   \frac{90}{9} = 10
   \]
   So, there are 10 groups.

2. Now, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. The problem says \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
   \]
   This means 6 groups brought back seashells.

3. Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The train starts with 172 people.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
   \[
   172 - 47 = 125
   \]
3. Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
   \[
   125 + 13 = 138
   \]
4. At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
   \[
   138 - 38 = 100
   \]

So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is \(\boxed{100}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Jamie earns $20 for each hour she works. On a regular day, she works 8 hours. So, her regular pay is:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

On Tuesday, she worked 11 hours. That means she worked 3 extra hours beyond her regular 8 hours. For these extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate. First, let's find out what 150% of $20 is:

\[ 150\% \times \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30 \]

So, for each of the 3 extra hours, she gets $30. Now, let's calculate her pay for the 3 extra hours:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Now, we add her regular pay and the extra pay to find out how much she earned on Tuesday:

\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."

The total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"Mike wanted to buy a pair of jeans that were on sale for 25% off. The jeans originally cost $40. 

First, we need to find out how much the discount is. To do this, we take 25% of $40:
\[ 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]
So, the discount is $10.

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]
So, the jeans now cost $30.

Mike pays with a $50 bill. To find out how much money he has left over, we subtract the sale price from $50:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over. The answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The company hires 20 new employees every month.
2. Over 3 months, the company hires \(20 \times 3 = 60\) new employees.
3. The company started with 200 employees. After hiring 60 new ones, the total number of employees is \(200 + 60 = 260\).
4. Each employee gets paid $4000 per month.
5. So, for 260 employees, the monthly salary is \(260 \times 4000 = 1040000\) dollars.
6. For 3 months, the total salary is \(1040000 \times 3 = 3120000\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how long the choir will sing ""Deck the Halls"". They are going to sing it twice, and each time it takes 150 seconds.
   - So, \(150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds}\).

2. Next, we need to find out how long they will sing ""Jingle Bells"". They are going to sing it once, and it takes 240 seconds.
   - So, \(240 \text{ seconds} \times 1 = 240 \text{ seconds}\).

3. Now, we add the time for both songs to find the total caroling time.
   - \(300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}\).

So, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many students there are in total. There are 40 classes and each class has 25 students. So, the total number of students is:
   \[
   40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students}
   \]
   Each student plants 1 tree, so the students plant:
   \[
   1000 \text{ trees}

Let's say she needs to buy \( x \) stuffed goats. After buying the goats, she will have 14 + \( x \) stuffed animals in total. We want the goats to be 30% of this total, so we can write:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve this:

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

"Kris wants to play a total of 30 hours to get an achievement. 

First, she plays half an hour every day for 2 weeks. 
- There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 14 days.
- Half an hour each day for 14 days means she plays \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, she plays 2 hours every day for a week. 
- There are 7 days in a week, so she plays \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, we add the hours from both parts:
- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs 30 hours to get the achievement. So, the hours she still needs to play are:
- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

1. The first car is going 60 miles per hour.
2. The second car is going 70 miles per hour.
3. Both cars are driving for 2 hours.

Now, let's find out how far each car travels in 2 hours.

For the first car:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 × 2 = 120 miles

For the second car:
- Speed = 70 miles per hour
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 70 × 2 = 140 miles

Now, we need to find out how much farther the second car has gone compared to the first car.

Difference in distance = Distance of second car - Distance of first car
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find out how much tea the students drank in total.

Four students each drank 1.5 quarts:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, we add the amounts together to find the total tea consumed:

   - Since there are two friends, they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters in total.

3. **Better Friend's Playing Time:**
   - The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours (240 minutes), the better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

4. **Total Quarters Used:**
   - Jack uses 12 quarters.
   - The two friends use 48 quarters.
   - The better friend uses 8 quarters.
   - Total quarters used: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\) quarters.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - So, the total cost is \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars.

The final answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Tanya makes a salt scrub and uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt.
4. She uses twice as much salt as citrus zest.

Let's say the amount of citrus zest is \( z \) ounces. Then:
- The amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- The amount of salt is \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces. So, we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]

We can divide the whole equation by 2:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

Now, we need to find out how much oil she uses. Oil is \( 2s \). From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can see that if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This works because it fits the total of 10 ounces.

So, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. Let's figure out how much money he spent.

First, we calculate the cost of the goats:
- He buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- So, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the cows:
- He buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- So, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the money John spent is:
\[
\boxed{4500}
\]"
"Paul needs 63 cupcakes for his party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. Let's add the cupcakes he already has: 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes.

Now, we need to find out how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy. We do this by subtracting the cupcakes he already has from the total he needs: 63 - 48 = 15 cupcakes.

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes.

The answer is 15."
"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Robert has 20 cars, so Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we do:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold. So, he gives away:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Now, to find out how many cars Joe has left, we subtract the cars he sold and gave away from his original number of cars:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, Joe remains with:

\[ \boxed{16} \text{ cars} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The charity raised a total of $175,000.
2. $50,000 came from organizations.
3. So, the amount raised by the students is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.
4. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount.
5. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students: $125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250.

So, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked for half of that time, which is 4 hours. So, the total time she walked over the two days is 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find the total time in minutes by multiplying 12 by 60. 

\[12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."
"Hunter saw 50 cars in the school parking lot when he arrived. During the first break, 20 more cars came, so the total became:

\[50 + 20 = 70\]

At lunchtime, half of the cars left. So, the number of cars that left is:

\[70 \div 2 = 35\]

This means the number of cars left in the parking lot during lunchtime is:

\[70 - 35 = 35\]

So, the total number of cars he counted during lunchtime is:

\[\boxed{35}\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. John does 30 cycles of work each day.
2. Each cycle has 5 tasks.
3. So, the number of tasks John does each day is \(30 \times 5 = 150\).
4. John works 7 days a week.
5. So, the number of tasks he does in a week is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).
6. Each task pays $1.20.
7. So, his total earnings for the week are \(1050 \times 1.20 = 1260\).

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{1260}

"Sasha and Julie played in two practice games. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 points less than Sasha, so she scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 points less than Julie's score from the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add her points from both games:
\[14 + 4 = 18\]

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games. The answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and each package has 11 tins. So, the total tins of cat food are:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

She also bought 6 packages of dog food and each package has 6 tins. So, the total tins of dog food are:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the tins of dog food from the tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

**Final Answer:**
52"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say PJ has \(P\) cards.
2. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards.
3. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.
4. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation: \(P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\).
5. Combining like terms, we get: \(7P + 12 = 341\).
6. Subtract 12 from both sides: \(7P = 329\).
7. Divide both sides by 7: \(P = 47\).

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, let's find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \(3 \times 47 = 141\) cards.
- Becca has \(141 + 12 = 153\) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"Cindy went to the park for the Easter Egg Hunt. She found 5 green eggs. She found twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so she found \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs. She found one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she found \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs. She found one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she found \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

So, the total number of eggs Cindy found is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

The answer is 27."
"Milly needs to return a book that weighs 4 pounds and costs $32. She needs to send it 20 miles to a distribution center. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. Amazon will only give her back 75% of the book's price.

First, let's find out how much the shipping will cost:
- For the weight: \(4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40\)
- For the distance: \(20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60\)
- Total shipping cost: \(\$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00\)

Next, let's see how much of the book's price she will get back:
- Refund amount: \(32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00\)

Now, let's find out how much money Milly will lose:
- Original cost: \$32
- Refund: \$24
- Shipping: \$3
- Net loss: \(\$32 - \$24 + \$3 = \$11\)

So, the money Milly will lose is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Mulan starts with $40. Her father gives her $100 more. So, she now has $40 + $100 = $140.

She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 * $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20.

The total she spends is $60 + $20 = $80.

So, the money she has left is $140 - $80 = $60.

The final amount of money Mulan has left is $60."
"Boris owns a chocolate factory. He makes 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. 

In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars.
In the second week, he makes half of what he made in the first week, which is 4,000 bars.
In the third week, he makes three times what he made in the first week, which is 24,000 bars.

To find out how many bars he makes in the fourth week, we need to add up the bars he made in the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

First, let's add the bars made in the first three weeks:
8,000 (first week) + 4,000 (second week) + 24,000 (third week) = 36,000 bars

Now, we subtract this from the total monthly production:
50,000 (total monthly production) - 36,000 (bars made in first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

The answer is: 14,000 bars."
"Britany does a few things for her TikTok videos each week. Let's add up the time she spends on all these activities in a month with four weeks.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - She records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, in one week, she spends \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes recording videos.
   - In four weeks, she spends \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - 2 hours is the same as 120 minutes.
   - In four weeks, she spends \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - So, in one week, she spends \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - In four weeks, she spends \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, let's add all the time together:
- Recording videos: 288 minutes
- Writing songs: 480 minutes
- Doing makeup: 360 minutes

So, the total time she spends on TikTok in a month is \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

**Final Answer:**

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The base cost for installing 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures is $129.00.
2. Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. The base already includes 4 mirrors and 1 chandelier.
3. So, she needs 2 more mirrors, 1 more chandelier, and 10 more pictures.
4. Each additional item costs $15.00.
5. For 2 more mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
6. For 1 more chandelier: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars.
7. For 10 more pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars.
8. The total cost for the additional items is \(30 + 15 + 150 = 195\) dollars.

So, the total cost for Angela is $324.00."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's $20.00:
   \[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
   So, Anthony has saved $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we take 40% of $30.00:
   \[ 0.40 \times 30 = 12 \]
4. Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find out how much Roy has:
   \[ 30 + 12 = 42 \]

So, Roy has saved $42.00.

The answer is: \boxed{42}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.**
2. **Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei.**
   - So, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.
3. **Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay.**
   - So, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.
4. **Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami.**
   - So, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

Now, we need to convert inches to feet:
- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- So, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

"Mason is riding his bike at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours, then takes a rest, and rides for another 6 hours.

First part:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Second part:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours
- Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance:
- Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

First, we know that three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. This means the distance they cover is the speed of one kangaroo times 18 hours times 3 kangaroos.

Now, if each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, then four turtles together will travel at twice the speed of one kangaroo. This is because four turtles at half speed each is the same as two full-speed kangaroos.

Since the distance is the same, and the four turtles together are like two full-speed kangaroos, it will take them longer than 18 hours but not as long as three times 18 hours (which would be 54 hours if they were only half-speed).

To find the exact time, we can use a simple calculation. If three kangaroos take 18 hours, then one kangaroo would take 3 times longer, which is 54 hours. Since four turtles are like two full-speed kangaroos, they will take half the time of one kangaroo, so:

\[ \text{Time for four turtles} = \frac{54 \text{ hours}}{2} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to cross the highway.

The answer is: \boxed{27}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

Now, let's add up all the dishes:
- Kora: 20 dishes
- Rory: 40 dishes
- Jada: 80 dishes

So, \(20 + 40 + 80 = 140\).

The total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"Erika wants to buy a laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the new one will cost her $200 less, so the new laptop will cost her $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has some money in her purse, got $150 from her part-time job, and her mom gave her $80. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's add up the money Erika has:
- Money in her purse: \( x \)
- Money from her part-time job: $150
- Money from her mom: $80

So, the total money Erika has is \( x + 150 + 80 \).

We know that \( x + 150 + 80 = 400 - 50 \) because she needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

So, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The answer is: \(\boxed{120}\)"

2. Adam also has 5 small apples. Each small apple can be cut into 3 pieces. So, for 5 small apples, he gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) pieces.
3. Now, we add the pieces from the large and small apples together: \(15 + 15 = 30\) pieces.
4. Adam eats 15 pieces. So, the number of pieces left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

So, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer gets 5 liters of milk from one cow each day. He has 3 cows, so he gets:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

He wants to get 25 liters of milk a day. So, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow gives 5 liters a day, he needs:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to get 25 liters of milk a day.

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each glue stick is 12 millimeters long.
2. The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \) not used. So, the unused part is \( 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \) millimeters.
3. The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \) not used. So, the unused part is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \) millimeters.
4. The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so it has \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \) not used. So, the unused part is \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \) millimeters.

Now, we add up all the unused parts:

"James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. In a year, which has 12 months, he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Cost of Green Food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost is \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of Red Food with Discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket, so each basket now costs \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - If you buy 3 baskets, the total cost is \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Add the cost of the green food and the red food together.
   - So, \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{123}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many rooms are in half of the motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, half of them would be:
   \[
   \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. Next, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean one room:
   \[
   45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
   \[
   \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"In the first year, they will build 12 homes.
In the second year, they will build three times as many homes as the first year, so that's \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
By the end of the second year, they will have built \(12 + 36 = 48\) homes.
In the third year, they will build double the number of homes they have built so far, which is \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.
So, the total number of homes built over the three years is \(12 + 36 + 96 = 144\).

The answer is 144."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. You are three years younger than your brother. So if your brother is \( B \) years old, you are \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. You are two years older than your sister. So if your sister is \( S \) years old, you are \( S + 2 \) years old.
3. Since you are the same age in both cases, we can say \( B - 3 = S + 2 \). This means \( S = B - 5 \).
4. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
5. The sum of all your ages is 87. So we have:
   \[
   (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87
   \]
6. Combine like terms:
   \[
   B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87
   \]
   \[
   6B - 9 = 87
   \]
7. Add 9 to both sides:
   \[
   6B = 96
   \]
8. Divide by 6:
   \[
   B = 16
   \]
9. Now, find your age:
   \[
   Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
   \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mr. Jackson has 27 students in his class.
2. Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
3. So, we need to find out how many glue sticks are needed in total:
   \[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

4. The glue sticks come in packs of 8.
5. We need to find out how many packs are needed to get at least 54 glue sticks. We divide 54 by 8:
   \[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

6. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the next whole number. This means we need 7 packs to have enough glue sticks.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   The river starts with 4000 gallons of water.

2. **After Heavy Rain:**
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, we need to multiply 4000 by 2:
   \[
   4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add 6000 to 8000:
   \[
   8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[
\boxed{14000}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Day 0**: We start with 10 people infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of these 10 people infects 6 others. So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people get infected. Now, the total number of infected people is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of these 70 people infects 6 others. So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people get infected. Now, the total number of infected people is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of these 490 people infects 6 others. So, \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people get infected. Now, the total number of infected people is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of people infected is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers, so we need to multiply 40 by 20 to find out how much she got in total:
\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]
So, Rafaela got $800 in tips.

Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of $800, we can calculate:
\[ 10 \times 800 = 80 \]
So, 10% of $800 is $80. Since Julieta got 10% less, we subtract $80 from $800:
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]
So, Julieta got $720 in tips.

To find out how much money they got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

So, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:
\[ \$1520 \]"
"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. She also gave 3 oranges to her son. So, she gave away a total of \(6 + 3 = 9\) oranges. Therefore, she remained with \(12 - 9 = 3\) oranges.

The answer is 3."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
   \[
   1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
   \]

2. Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
   \]

3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
   \[
   3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[
36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
\]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour. She baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. So, she baked:

\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is:

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. So, the total amount raised is:

\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount raised is \(\boxed{40}\) dollars."
"Gretchen has 70 gold coins. She has 30 fewer silver coins than gold coins, so she has \(70 - 30 = 40\) silver coins.

2. Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
3. So, the total number of burritos eaten is \(500 + 20 = 520\).
4. Mr. George ordered 600 burritos in total.
5. To find out how many burritos are left, we subtract the number of burritos eaten from the total number ordered: \(600 - 520 = 80\).

So, the total number of leftover burritos is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. Green cars are 2 fewer than red cars, so we have \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. Blue cars are 3 times the number of green cars, so we have \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. So, to find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(23\).

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books.
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's use some simple letters to represent the number of books each person has:
- Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books.
- Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has \( F - 12 \) books.
- Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \) books.

Now, we know that the total number of books is 85, so we can write:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Let's add these up:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Now, let's solve for \( F \):
\[ 3F = 85 - 1 \]
\[ 3F = 84 \]
\[ F = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The total cost of groceries for Madeline and Keenan is $400 per month.
2. Madeline pays 60% of this cost. So, we need to find 60% of $400.
3. To find 60% of $400, we do:
   \[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]
   So, Madeline pays $240 per month.
4. This means Keenan pays the rest, which is:
   \[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]
   So, Keenan pays $160 per month.
5. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4 to find out how much he pays per week:
   \[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \]
   So, Keenan spends $40 per week.

The final answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out how old she is now, we subtract 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
So, we need to find out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old. We already know she is 8 now, so we subtract 8 from 24:
\[ 24 - 8 = 16 \]
So, in 16 years, Melanie will be 24 years old, which is three times her current age.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, each pack of bacon costs $10 ÷ 5 = $2.
2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs $2 × 2 = $4. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is $4 × 6 = $24.
3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, so the total cost for strawberries is $4 × 3 = $12.
4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is $2 × 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the money she has left is $65 - $60 = $5.

"Sure, let's solve this together!

Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, plus a 15-minute encore. The total time for the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's say her usual concert is \( x \) minutes long. Then, the final concert would be \( 2x + 15 \) minutes long.

We know that:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

The answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number he started with.

First, let's add up the toys he gave away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the original number:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jerry sees 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He sees \(\frac{2}{3}\) of 6 birds flying overhead. So, \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) birds are flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, \(3 \times 8 = 24\) birds are feeding.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[6 + 4 + 24 = 34\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34.

The answer is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 of them. So, she had \(55 - 5 = 50\) cookies left. She then put these 50 cookies into 5 jars equally. To find out how many cookies are in each jar, we divide 50 by 5, which is \(50 \div 5 = 10\).

So, the number of cookies in each jar is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals.
2. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

3. Joelle also has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals.
4. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

5. Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids.
6. We do this by subtracting the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals: \(40 - 25 = 15\).

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is: 15"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in total.
2. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]
   This means there are 25 indoor plants.
3. Now, we need to find out how many plants are left after taking away the indoor plants:
   \[ 100 - 25 = 75 \]
   So, there are 75 plants left.
4. Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]
   This means there are 50 outdoor plants.
5. The rest of the plants are flowering plants. So, we subtract the indoor and outdoor plants from the total:
   \[ 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]
   This means there are 25 flowering plants.
6. To find out what percentage of the plants are flowering plants, we use:
   \[ \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is \(\boxed{25\%}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob.
2. The whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.
3. So, if we divide 121 by 11, we can find out how fast a thingamabob spins:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11 \text{ meters per second}
   \]
4. Now, a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob.
5. Since a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, a whirligig spins:
   \[
   5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second}
   \]

So, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The salad costs $6.
3. The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $3.
4. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
5. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods.
6. So, the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
7. Since Ellen eats 2 carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We need to find out how much she made from lemonade sales.

First, let's understand how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns:
- Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.
- Kamala's lawn was mowed thrice as many times as Joe's.
- Alba's lawn was mowed five times as many times as Joe's.

Let's say Tasha mowed Joe's lawn \( J \) times. Then:
- She mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
- She mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.

The total money she earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

So, the total money from mowing lawns is \( 54J \).

We know Tasha made $80 in total. So, the money from lemonade sales \( L \) can be found by:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to know \( J \). The simplest way is to assume \( J = 1 \):
\[ L + 54 \times 1 = 80 \]
\[ L + 54 = 80 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54 \]
\[ L = 26 \]

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales.

The answer is: \(\boxed{26}\)"

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages.
2. Yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages.
3. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
4. Daniel did not read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.

Now, let's add up the pages they read:

- Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much material is needed for one small mask. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. So, for one small mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to make 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one small mask by 20:
\[ 0.5 \text{ yards} \times 20 = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we need to find out how much material is needed for one large mask. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, for one large mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to make 8 large masks, we multiply the material needed for one large mask by 8:
\[ 0.75 \text{ yards} \times 8 = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Finally, we add the material needed for the small masks and the large masks to get the total amount of material needed:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

"The bus travels 60 miles every hour and it travels for 5 hours. So, the bus travels \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles.

The car travels 30 miles every hour and it travels for 8 hours. So, the car travels \(30 \times 8 = 240\) miles.

To find out how much farther the bus went than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled. So, \(300 - 240 = 60\) miles.

The bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

So, the answer is 60 miles."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we know Sophie has:
- 31 building blocks
- 8 stuffed animals
- 9 stacking rings

Now, let's add these up:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. So, to find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the number of other toys from the total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean together are 100 years old. So, if we add their ages, it should be 100.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean. So, if Jean is \( J \) years old, then Paul is \( J + 10 \) years old.
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages. So, Peter is \( (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \) years old.

Now, let's put it all together:
- Peter's age: \( 2J + 10 \)
- Paul's age: \( J + 10 \)
- Jean's age: \( J \)

Adding these up, we get:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now we can find the ages:
- Jean is 20 years old.
- Paul is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) years old.
- Peter is \( 2(20) + 10 = 50 \) years old.

So, Peter is 50 years old.

The answer is: \(\boxed{50}\)"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, for her 4 friends, that's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, Maria's mom gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) more balloons.

Now, let's add everything up:
- Balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Balloons given by mom: 15

So, the total number of balloons is \(8 + 1 + 15 = 24\).

The total number of balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total.
2. 10 people each donate 5 boxes, so that's \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
3. They already have 10 boxes.
4. So, the total number of boxes is \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to figure out how many tables they need:

5. Each table can hold 2 boxes.
6. So, for 60 boxes, they need \(60 \div 2 = 30\) tables.

Now, we know they already have 15 tables:

7. So, the number of new tables they need is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how far Zoey spits all her seeds. Zoey has 40 seeds and each seed goes 10 feet. So, we multiply 40 by 10:
   \[
   40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. Next, we find out how far Sydney spits all her seeds. Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed goes 12 feet. So, we multiply 35 by 12:
   \[
   35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. Now, we add the distances together to find the total distance spat by both:
   \[
   400 + 420 = 820 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2 (since there are two people):
   \[
   \frac{820}{2} = 410 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Widgeteer 3000:**
   - Makes 60 widgets per hour.
   - Runs 24 hours a day.
   - For 30 days in a month.
   - So, in a month, it makes \(60 \times 24 \times 30 = 43,200\) widgets.

2. **WidgetMaster 9000:**
   - Makes 45 widgets per hour.
   - Runs 24 hours a day.
   - For 30 days in a month.
   - So, in a month, it makes \(45 \times 24 \times 30 = 32,400\) widgets.

3. **Revenue Calculation:**
   - Each widget sells for $6.
   - Revenue from Widgeteer 3000: \(43,200 \times 6 = 259,200\) dollars.
   - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000: \(32,400 \times 6 = 194,400\) dollars.

4. **Difference in Revenue:**
   - The difference is \(259,200 - 194,400 = 64,800\) dollars.

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000.

**Answer: $64,800**"
"Cameron stays at the hotel from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours in total.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For the extra hours, it charges 70 pesos per hour.

Cameron stays for 5 extra hours (17 hours - 12 hours). So, the cost for the extra hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

The total cost for Cameron is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron paid for a 24-hour stay, it would cost 1600 pesos.

The money Cameron saves by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

So, Cameron saves 250 pesos."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
2. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, twice the amount for a goat is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) pounds. Then, 3 pounds less than that is \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds for each sheep.
3. There are 15 goats, so the total hay for goats is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds.
4. There are 12 sheep, so the total hay for sheep is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds.
5. To find the total hay needed, we add the hay for goats and sheep: \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

So, the total amount of hay Nate needs is \(\boxed{159}\) pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. John earns 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours.
   - So, he earned \(50 \times 6 = 300\) dollars.

2. He spends 50 dollars on gas.
   - After buying gas, he has \(300 - 50 = 250\) dollars left.

3. He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.
   - After depositing, he has \(250 - 100 = 150\) dollars left.

4. He buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each.
   - The cost of 5 pencils is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
   - After buying pencils, he has \(150 - 50 = 100\) dollars left.

5. He wants to buy pens that cost 25 dollars each.
   - With 100 dollars, he can buy \(100 \div 25 = 4\) pens.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word had 15 letters.
2. To find out how many letters Craig spelled, we multiply 20 by 15:
   \[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]
   So, Craig spelled 300 letters.

3. Craig's brother spelled 50 more letters than Craig.
4. To find out how many letters Craig's brother spelled, we add 50 to 300:
   \[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]
   So, Craig's brother spelled 350 letters.

5. To find the total number of letters they both spelled, we add the letters Craig spelled to the letters his brother spelled:
   \[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. So, for one school, the number of children is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).
4. There are 5 different schools.
5. Therefore, the total number of children is \(56 \times 5 = 280\).

So, the total number of children in the drill is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be exchanged for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:
   \[ 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

2. There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
   \[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

3. To find out how many bottles are left for the teacher, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:
   \[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house, plus $35 for each hour of work, and extra for parts. For this job, it took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts.

First, we calculate the labor cost:
- 2.25 hours at $35 per hour is \(2.25 \times 35 = 78.75\).

Now, we add all the costs together:
- Visit charge: $40
- Labor charge: $78.75
- Parts charge: $60

So, the total cost is \(40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75\).

The total charge for the job is $178.75."
"James buys 10 CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost before any discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = \$150 \]

He gets a 40% discount, so he saves 40% of $150:

\[ 0.40 \times 150 = \$60 \]

So, the cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 - 60 = \$90 \]

James doesn't like 5 of the CDs and sells them for $40 each. So, the money he gets from selling 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \times 40 = \$200 \]

Since he only spent $90 and got $200 from selling the CDs, he actually made money. But the question asks how much money he was out, which is the initial cost:

\[ \boxed{\$90} \]"
"Jen has some root crops to sell. She has 6 yams at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each, and 4 carrots at $1.25 each. Let's calculate how much she will earn from each type of root crop.

For the yams:
6 yams × $1.5 per yam = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes × $2 per sweet potato = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots × $1.25 per carrot = $5

Now, let's add up all the earnings:
$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

So, if Jen sells everything, she will earn $34."
"James swims across a 20-mile lake. He swims 60% of the distance first. 

1. Calculate the distance he swims first:
   - 60% of 20 miles = \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles

2. Calculate the time it takes to swim 12 miles:
   - Speed = 2 miles per hour
   - Time = \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \) hours

3. He rests for half the time he swam:
   - Rest time = \( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \) hours

4. The remaining distance is:
   - Total distance - Distance swum = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles

5. His new speed is half of his original speed:
   - New speed = \( \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \)

6. Calculate the time to swim the remaining 8 miles:
   - Time = \( \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \) hours

7. Add up all the times:
   - Time to swim first part + Rest time + Time to swim remaining part = \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
2. Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is \(7 \times 70 = 490\).
3. The bakery has 40 less than 490, so we do \(490 - 40 = 450\).

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The answer is 450."
"Jasmine starts with no stickers. She gets 15 stickers for participating in class, so she has 15 stickers. Then she loses 7 stickers during playtime, so she has 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left. Her teacher gives her 5 more stickers for helping classmates, so she ends up with 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

The final number of stickers Jasmine has is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **New York Times:**
   - Each copy costs $5.
   - Cayley gets 10% commission.
   - Commission per copy = $5 × 10% = $5 × 0.10 = $0.50.
   - He sold 6 copies.
   - Total commission from New York Times = $0.50 × 6 = $3.00.

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Each copy costs $15.
   - Cayley gets 8% commission.
   - Commission per copy = $15 × 8% = $15 × 0.08 = $1.20.
   - He sold 10 copies.
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal = $1.20 × 10 = $12.00.

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal.
   - Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, so we subtract 5 from 26:
   \[
   26 - 5 = 21
   \]
   So, Marcus is 21 years old.
3. Marcus is also half of Leo’s age. This means if we double Marcus's age, we get Leo’s age:
   \[
   21 \times 2 = 42
   \]

So, Leo is 42 years old.

The answer is 42."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points.
2. Bahati scored the most points. He scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's use some simple math to find out how many points Azibo scored.

If we say Azibo scored \( A \) points, then:
- Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points.
- Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

Now, we know the total points:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that 100 pages of paper stack up to 1 inch.
2. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
3. So, if 1 inch has 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will have:
   \[
   1.5 \times 100 = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]
4. But remember, each piece of paper is printed on both sides. So, each piece of paper actually gives us 2 pages.
5. To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to divide the total number of pages by 2:
   \[
   \frac{150}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
   \]

So, the book has 75 pages."
"Vince can staple 30 reports in 15 minutes. He was stapling from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. That's 15 hours in total.

First, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 hours, there are:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide 900 minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many 15-minute intervals there are:
\[ 900 \div 15 = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 30 reports:
\[ 60 \times 30 = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports.

The final answer is 1800 reports."
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. That's 480 minutes (8 hours × 60 minutes).

One day, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes of sleepwalking.

From 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes, which is 220 minutes.

So, the total time she was awake that night is 220 minutes (awake before getting out of bed) + 23 minutes (sleepwalking) = 243 minutes.

Her usual sleep time is 480 minutes, so the time she actually slept is 480 minutes - 243 minutes = 237 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 24 measuring cups because two dozen is 24.

He has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) measuring spoons.

Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so he has \(16 - 6 = 10\) measuring spoons left.

Now, we add the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons: \(24 + 10 = 34\).

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has left is 34.

The answer is: \(\boxed{34}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The hospital can hold 1000 patients.
2. At first, 1 out of every 5 beds is occupied. So, \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds are occupied.
3. This means \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds are not occupied.
4. Every day, 50 more patients come to the hospital. Over 2 weeks (14 days), \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) more patients come.
5. So, the total number of patients now is \( 200 + 700 = 900 \).
6. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds is \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \).

The total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is **100**."
"Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

16 - 7 = 9

Now, two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to family. So, the number of emails sent to family is:

(2/3) × 9 = 6

This means the remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

9 - 6 = 3

But the problem also says that one-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

(1/3) × 3 = 1

So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so:
   \[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so:
   \[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. But Kelly said Courtney was wrong and that number was 20% more than the real number of people.

If the real number of people is \( x \), then 20% more than \( x \) is \( x + 0.2x = 1.2x \).

So, \( 1.2x = 48 \).

To find \( x \), we need to divide 48 by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]

Let's do the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 40.

The answer is 40."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

1. We know that Jason carried 2 balls.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. So, Jeffrey carried half as many as Jason. That means Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. So, Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls.

Now, let's add up all the balls:
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried 4 balls.

So, the total number of balls is \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

We know that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, they had 10 holes, so:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. Collins got 15 more than each of them. So, Collins got:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

"Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. 

First, we find 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{50}{100} \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the cost of the tickets is:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

The total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon.
2. Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught. So, Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
3. Alex caught 5 more than what Stan caught. So, Alex caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.
4. Together, they caught 339 Pokemon. So, we can write the equation: \( A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \).

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]
\[ 9A = 360 \]
\[ A = 40 \]

So, Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, let's find out how many Pokemon Stan caught:

\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

The answer is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes in one episode. So, we have:

- Minutes per episode: 20
- Number of episodes: 20 ÷ 2 = 10

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the minutes per episode:

- Total minutes: 10 episodes × 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

So, the answer is:

\[

"The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so it travels:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Then, it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so it travels:
\[ 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, it flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so it travels:
\[ 5 \times 22 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

To find the total distance south, we add the first and third legs:
\[ 300 + 110 = 410 \text{ miles} \]

We then subtract the distance flown north:
\[ 410 - 36 = 374 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta made 12 brownies for herself. At her office party, she got 6 more brownies (which is half a dozen). When her friends threw her a surprise party, they gave her 48 brownies (which is 4 dozen). During the surprise party, 18 brownies were eaten (which is one and a half dozen).

Let's add up all the brownies Greta had:
- 12 brownies from herself
- 6 brownies from the office party
- 48 brownies from her friends

So, \(12 + 6 + 48 = 66\) brownies in total.

Then, we subtract the 18 brownies that were eaten:
\(66 - 18 = 48\)

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over.

The final answer is 48."
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice Nani's age, so his brother is 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 6 years old. The total age of all three family members is 30 years.

So, the answer is 30."
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to do some simple math.

Andy has 12 racquets to string. He needs to string:
- 3 racquets with synthetic gut, which takes 15 minutes each.
- 5 racquets with polyester string, which takes 22 minutes each.
- 4 racquets with a hybrid set, which takes 18 minutes each.

First, let's calculate the time for each type of string:
- For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut: \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.
- For the 5 racquets with polyester string: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.
- For the 4 racquets with a hybrid set: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
\(45 + 110 + 72 = 227\) minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets.

The final answer is 227 minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, so he needs 4 phones in total.

The first two phones cost $600 each, so:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The next two phones are half price, so each costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

So, the cost for the next two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, John paid a total of $1800 for all the phones. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. First, we know that Carlton's team has 13 players.
2. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we add 7 to the number of players on Carlton's team to find out how many players are on Zeke's team.
3. That means Zeke's team has \(13 + 7 = 20\) players.
4. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team.
5. So, \(13 + 20 = 33\).

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is \(\boxed{33}\)."
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to figure out the total length of the fence he is building. The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, so we need to add these two measurements together and then double the result because a rectangle has two lengths and two widths.

So, we do:
\[ 15 + 10 = 25 \]
Then we double it:
\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \]
This means the total length of the fence is 50 feet.

Now, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of the fence. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2:
\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

The answer is: \boxed{100}"
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 4 boxes in total. That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes. She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes, which is 8 / 4 = 2 boxes. So, she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 120."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. The USA has 50 states.
2. India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
3. Half of the USA's states is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
4. So, India has \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.
5. Now, to find the total number of states in both countries, we add the states of the USA and India together: \( 50 + 29 = 79 \).

So, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"Tyler wants to buy some books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. He has $14 saved from his allowance. He earns $5 for every hour he works.

First, let's add up the cost of the books:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Now, let's see how much more money Tyler needs:
Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Robert has 30 cherries.
2. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
3. The total number of cherries is 60. So, if we subtract the cherries that Robert and Richard have, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has:
   \[60 - 30 - 20 = 10\]
   So, Jerry has 10 cherries.
4. Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has:
   \[30 - 10 = 20\]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

**Saturday:**
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold \(10 - 4 = 6\) boxes of apple pie.

**Sunday:**
- Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

**Costs:**
- Gingerbread costs $6 per box.
- Apple pie costs $15 per box.

**Calculating earnings for Saturday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(10 \times 6 = 60\) dollars.
- Apple pie earnings: \(6 \times 15 = 90\) dollars.
- Total earnings for Saturday: \(60 + 90 = 150\) dollars.

**Calculating earnings for Sunday:**
- Gingerbread earnings: \(15 \times 6 = 90\) dollars.
- Apple pie earnings: \(15 \times 15 = 225\) dollars.
- Total earnings for Sunday: \(90 + 225 = 315\) dollars.

**Total earnings for both days:**
- Total earnings: \(150 + 315 = 465\) dollars.

So, Sunny earned a total of 465 dollars for the two days.

"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. She will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days. 

First, let's find out how much sunscreen she uses each day:
1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces/day

Now, let's find out how much sunscreen she uses over 8 days:
4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces

Each bottle of sunscreen has 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount in each bottle:
32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. The answer is \boxed{4}."
"The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find out how much the red car costs, we need to calculate 40% of $100 and then subtract that from $100.

40% of $100 is:
\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

So, the red car costs:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the blue car and the red car:
\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

So, both cars cost a total of $160."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When Emil turns 24, that will be in 5 years.
3. At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
4. At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

Now, let's find their current ages:

- If Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his dad will be 48 in 5 years. So, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- If Emil will be 24 in 5 years, his brother will be 12 in 5 years. So, his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

Finally, we add their current ages together:

- Dad's age: 43
- Brother's age: 7
- Sum: \(43 + 7 = 50\)

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
```
50

"Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 beads. 

Now, let's add them all up:
- From her mother: 20 beads
- From her sister: 30 beads
- From her friend: 40 beads

So, 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
   \[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
   \[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]
4. Now, let's add up all the crawfish he caught:
   \[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]
5. Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we divide the total pounds by 3 to find the number of servings:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:
   \[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players:
   \[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

3. Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate:
   \[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

4. Now, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

"Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Length of the Flower Bed**: The flower bed is 111 feet long.
2. **Space Each Plant Needs**: Each plant needs 1 foot to grow and 1.5 feet of space between each plant. So, each plant needs 2.5 feet of space.
3. **Number of Plants That Can Fit**: We divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs:
   \[
   \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \text{ plants}
   \]
   Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we take the whole number, which is 44 plants.
4. **Plants Already Owned**: Pat already has 17 plants.
5. **Plants to Buy**: We need to find out how many more plants Pat needs to buy:
   \[
   44 \text{ plants} - 17 \text{ plants} = 27 \text{ plants}

So, the answer is 63 pretzels."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each basket needs 3 petunias, and Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - So, \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

2. Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines, and Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - So, \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

3. Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - So, \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

4. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - So, \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to know how much soil is used for the sunflowers. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds, and they planted 4 sunflowers. So, \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds of soil for sunflowers.

2. Next, we need to know how much soil is used for the carnations. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and they planted 10 carnations. So, \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds of soil for carnations.

3. Now, we add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations: \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds.

4. They started with 30 pounds of soil. So, the soil left for planting roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds.

5. Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. So, with 3 pounds left, they can plant \(3 \div 1 = 3\) roses.

"Jessica makes $2,000.00 each month. She saves 25% of her money for fancy shoes. So, she saves:
\[ 2000 \times 0.25 = 500 \]
This means she saves $500.00 each month for shoes.

In a year, there are 12 months, so she saves:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]
This means she saves $6,000.00 in a year.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. So, the number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year is:
\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

"Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute and sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

First, let's find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp:
- She peels 6 shrimp in 1 minute.
- So, to peel 90 shrimp, it will take:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, let's find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp:
- She sautés 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she sautés 3 shrimp in 1 minute.
- So, to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Since she needs to do both tasks one after the other, we add the times together:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. It cools the room by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 3 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. It cools the room by 3 degrees each hour. So, in 4 hours, it cools the room by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. During this time, the room warms up by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's find out the total change in temperature:
- The room cooled by 6 degrees and 12 degrees, so it cooled by \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- The room warmed up by 4 degrees.

So, the net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"Sure, let's break it down in a simple way!

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet again when he was three times his dad's age when he saw it. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet the second time.
3. The comet comes back every 75 years. So, the time between the two sightings is 75 years.
4. If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw it the first time.

So, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"Sure, let's count the checks Buford writes each month and then for the whole year.

1. **Electric bill**: He writes 1 check every month.
   - In a year, that's \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks.

2. **Gas bill**: He writes 1 check every month.
   - In a year, that's \(12 \times 1 = 12\) checks.

3. **Church**: He writes 2 checks every month.
   - In a year, that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) checks.

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes 1 check every 3 months (quarterly).
   - In a year, that's \(4 \times 1 = 4\) checks.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The first plane makes a total of 88 flights in a day. This is because the second plane makes 44 flights, and it's said that the first plane makes twice as many flights as the second plane.

2. Out of these 88 flights, 3/4 of the flights go to Greece. So, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]
   This means 66 flights go to Greece.

3. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So, we need to find out how many flights are left after the 66 flights to Greece:
   \[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]
   These 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany, so:
   \[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.

The answer is: \boxed{11}"
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that's 2 times 20 seconds, which is 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so that's 20 seconds plus 40 seconds, which is 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up all their howls:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

So, 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

To change seconds to minutes, we divide by 60 because there are 60 seconds in a minute:
120 ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

We know:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of all four children is 20.
- Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.

First, let's find the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total age of all four children is 20, we can find the total age of Helene and Wilfred by subtracting the total age of Akbar and Alessandro from 20:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

So, Helene and Wilfred together are 13 years old.

Next, we know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is the total age divided by the number of children:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Helene's age is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know Helene is 10 years old. Since Helene and Wilfred together are 13 years old, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from 13:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."

So, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let's think about this step by step.

1. We have 2 adults and 4 kids, making a total of 6 people.
2. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.
3. Let's say each kid gets 1 slice. Then each adult gets 2 slices.
4. So, the total number of slices is \(4 \text{ (kids)} \times 1 \text{ slice each} + 2 \text{ (adults)} \times 2 \text{ slices each} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ slices}\).
5. Each adult gets 2 slices out of the total 8 slices.
6. To find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula: \(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total slices}} \times 100\).
7. So, \(\frac{2}{8} \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%\).

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The answer is 25%."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Doctor Jones spends 20 minutes on each inpatient and he has 9 inpatients. So, the total time for inpatient rounds is:

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

**2:00 pm**"
"Lisa and Peter sold a total of 8 boxes of chocolate bars together. They sold 64 chocolate bars in total. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

So, we do:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

This means there are 8 chocolate bars in each box.

The answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The dance studio costs $25 to rent the studio per session.
2. Each student costs $1.50 per session, and there are 10 students.
3. So, the cost for the students per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
4. Adding the studio rental and the students' cost, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
5. The studio is rented 3 days a week, so the cost per day is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars.
6. There are about 4 weeks in a month, so the cost per month is \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars.

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide 56 by 7:
\[ 56 \div 7 = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number in Peter's box:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find the number of female porcupines:**
   - Total porcupines = 50
   - Female porcupines = \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 50
   - Female porcupines = \(\frac{3 \times 50}{5} = 30\)

2. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month:**
   - Each female gives birth to 4 babies
   - Baby porcupines per month = 30 (females) \(\times\) 4 (babies) = 120

3. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year
   - Baby porcupines in a year = 120 (per month) \(\times\) 12 (months) = 1440

4. **Find the total number of porcupines after a year:**
   - Initial porcupines = 50
   - New porcupines = 1440
   - Total porcupines = 50 + 1440 = 1490

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"To find out how much it will cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool**: The pool is a rectangular shape, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangle, which is length times width times depth.
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet
   - Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet

2. **Convert the volume to gallons**: The pool company says to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
   - Volume in gallons = 1400 × 5.9 = 8260 gallons

3. **Calculate the cost**: The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon.
   - Cost = 8260 gallons × $0.10 per gallon = $826

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"Sure, let's count the sticks step by step:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so we add 5 to 9: \(9 + 5 = 14\) blue sticks.
3. There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue sticks, so we subtract 3 from 14: \(14 - 3 = 11\) yellow sticks.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

So, the total number of sticks is \(9 + 14 + 11 = 34\).

The answer is 34."
"Matteo drove for 4 hours at 55 miles per hour. So, the distance he drove is:
\[ 55 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 220 \text{ miles} \]

Shandy drove for 10 hours at 45 miles per hour. So, the distance she drove is:
\[ 45 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 450 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo drove from the distance Shandy drove:
\[ 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The school has 3000 students in total.
2. Half of these students are over 16 years old, so:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are over 16 years old}
   \]
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \text{ male students are over 16 years old}
   \]
4. The rest of the students over 16 are female, so:
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125 \text{ female students are over 16 years old}
   \]
5. The other half of the students are under 16 years old, so:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \text{ students are under 16 years old}
   \]
6. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ male students are under 16 years old}
   \]
7. The rest of the students under 16 are female, so:
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750 \text{ female students are under 16 years old}
   \]
8. To find the total number of female students, we add the female students over 16 and under 16:
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

So, the total number of female students enrolled at the school is \(\boxed{1875}\)."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 14 laps. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 7 laps. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 5 laps. To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The answer is: 5"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The tank can hold 18,000 gallons of water.
2. On the first day:
   - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank.
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B filled 3/4 as much as Wanda.
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water filled on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. On the second day:
   - Wanda filled 2/3 of what she filled on the first day.
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B filled 1/3 of what she filled on the first day.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water filled on the second day:
     \[
     3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. Total water filled over two days:
   \[
   7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. Remaining capacity of the tank:
   \[

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Maria's power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours.
2. After 5 hours, it loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours.
3. After 8 hours, the power bank has 28% charge left.

First, let's find out how much charge is left after the first 5 hours. If the power bank loses 9% each hour, it keeps 91% (100% - 9%) of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, it keeps:
\[ 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 \times 0.91 = 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, it loses 7% each hour, so it keeps 93% (100% - 7%) of its charge each hour. So, after 3 more hours, it keeps:
\[ 0.93 \times 0.93 \times 0.93 = 0.93^3 \]

So, the total charge left after 8 hours is:
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the power bank has 28% charge left. So:
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \times \text{initial charge} = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate \(0.91^5\) and \(0.93^3\):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.624 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.804 \]

So:
\[ 0.624 \times 0.804 \times \text{initial charge} = 0.28 \]
\[ 0.501 \times \text{initial charge} = 0.28 \]
\[ \text{initial charge} = \frac{0.28}{0.501} \approx 0.557 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge is about 56%.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"Janet works 40 hours a week and earns $10 from wages and $15 from tips each hour. So, she earns $25 each hour. 

She wants to save 20% of $10,000 for a car down payment. 

20% of $10,000 is $2,000. 

If she works 40 hours a week, she earns $1,000 each week. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide $2,000 by $1,000. 

$2,000 ÷ $1,000 = 2 weeks. 

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

The answer is: 2 weeks."
"Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruit. He already bought 3 peaches at $0.50 each, 4 pears at $0.50 each, 2 kiwis at $1 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each. Let's add up what he spent:

- Peaches: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\)
- Pears: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\)
- Kiwis: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\)
- Apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\)

Now, let's add these up to find out how much he has spent in total:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\]

Jamaar started with $10, so the money left is:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\]

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Anne bought a box with 15 packs of sweets.
2. Each pack has 60 pieces of sweets.
3. So, the total number of sweets is \(15 \times 60 = 900\) pieces.
4. Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away \(15 - 2 = 13\) packs.
5. Each of the 13 packs has 60 pieces, so the total number of sweets she gave away is \(13 \times 60 = 780\) pieces.
6. Anne has 10 friends, and she gave the 780 pieces equally among them.
7. So, each friend gets \(780 \div 10 = 78\) pieces.

Therefore, each friend received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The price of carrots starts at $120.
2. Every year, the price goes up by 5% of the original price.

First, let's find out what 5% of $120 is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 6 \]

So, after the first year, the price will be:
\[ 120 + 6 = 126 \]

Next year, the price will go up by 5% of $126:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 126 = \frac{5}{100} \times 126 = 6.3 \]

So, after the second year, the price will be:
\[ 126 + 6.3 = 132.3 \]

Finally, the third year, the price will go up by 5% of $132.3:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 132.3 = \frac{5}{100} \times 132.3 = 6.615 \]

So, after the third year, the price will be:
\[ 132.3 + 6.615 = 138.915 \]

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest whole number, we get $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years is \(\boxed{139}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and put them into 8 albums. She put the same number of pictures in each album. So, we need to divide 72 by 8 to find out how many pictures are in each album:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album has 9 pictures.

Now, we know that 3 of the albums are only selfies and 2 of the albums are only portraits. Each of these albums has 9 pictures. So, the total number of selfies is:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

To find the total number of portraits and selfies, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. He reads 18 pages. To find out how long he spends reading, we can first figure out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages. 

18 pages divided by 3 pages per set is 6 sets. 

Since each set of 3 pages takes 10 minutes, we multiply 6 sets by 10 minutes per set:

6 sets × 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

The answer is 60 minutes."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests leave early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests leave late, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people check in as those who left late. Since 15 guests left late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people check in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Questions**: There are 60 questions in the quiz.
2. **Easy Questions**: 40% of 60 questions are easy. So, \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\) easy questions.
3. **Remaining Questions**: The rest of the questions are \(60 - 24 = 36\). These 36 questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions, so each has \(36 \div 2 = 18\) questions.

Now, let's see how many questions Aries is sure to get right:

4. **Easy Questions**: Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions right. So, \(0.75 \times 24 = 18\) easy questions.
5. **Average Questions**: Aries is sure to get half of the average questions right. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) average questions.
6. **Difficult Questions**: Aries is also sure to get half of the difficult questions right. So, \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\) difficult questions.

Finally, we add up all the questions Aries is sure to get right:

So, the number of questions Aries is sure to get right is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so a large one costs 3 times $4, which is $12.

Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's say she sold \(x\) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \(2x\) small stuffed animals.

The money she made from selling small stuffed animals is \(2x \times 4 = 8x\). The money from selling large stuffed animals is \(x \times 12 = 12x\).

The total money she made is $120, so:
\[8x + 12x = 120\]
\[20x = 120\]
\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Since \(x\) is the number of large stuffed animals sold, and she sold twice as many small ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

So, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

So, the family eats \(\boxed{77}\) sandwiches in one week."
"Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her.

First, let's find out how much money she made from the cookies:
80 cookies * $1 = $80

Next, let's find out how much money she made from the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 = $240

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes to find her total earnings:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe. So, 50% of 24 pounds is \(24 \times 0.5 = 12\) pounds. Therefore, with a steel pickaxe, he can mine \(24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.
4. Now, if we have 40 dwarves, and each can mine 36 pounds per day, then together they can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.
5. If we have 30 days in a month, then in 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how much one sandwich costs in each package.
2. For the first package, it has 2 sandwiches for $3. So, one sandwich costs:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. For the second package, it has 4 sandwiches for $6. So, one sandwich costs:
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Since the price per sandwich is the same in both packages, it is $1.50.
5. Now, we need to find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches will cost. If one sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches will cost:
   \[
   8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Sally started with:
   - 25 red balloons
   - 7 green balloons
   - 12 yellow balloons

2. A gust of wind burst 40% of the red balloons:
   - 40% of 25 is \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \)
   - So, 10 red balloons burst
   - Remaining red balloons: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)

3. Sally released half of the yellow balloons:
   - Half of 12 is \( 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \)
   - So, 6 yellow balloons were released
   - Remaining yellow balloons: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

4. Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection:
   - 75% of 8 is \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \)
   - So, she added 6 blue balloons

5. Now, let's add up all the balloons she has:
   - Red balloons: 15
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 6
   - Blue balloons: 6

   Total number of balloons: \( 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \)

So, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is 34."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. **Substitute Teacher**: There's a 50% chance the teacher won't be there, so Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
2. **Normal Teacher with Extension**: There's a 40% chance the normal teacher will give everyone an extension, so Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework.
3. **Normal Teacher without Extension, Marcus Gets an Extension**: There's a 60% chance the normal teacher won't give an extension, and then a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher, so the chance of this happening is 60% * 20% = 12%.

Now, we add up all the chances that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- 50% (substitute teacher)
- 40% (normal teacher with extension)
- 12% (normal teacher without extension, but Marcus gets an extension)

So, the total chance that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework is:
50% + 40% + 12% = 102%

But we need the chance that he **does** have to turn in his homework. So we subtract from 100%:
100% - 102% = -2%

Since a negative percentage doesn't make sense here, we need to rethink. The correct way is to find the chance he does have to turn it in, which is:
100% - 102% = 89.8%

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is 89.8%.

**Final Answer: 89.8%**"

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - So, he can eat \(2 \times 75 = 150\) medium jelly beans.

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium jelly bean.
   - Therefore, for 150 medium jelly beans, he can eat \(150 \times 3 = 450\) small jelly beans.

So, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she works a total of:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She gets paid $15 each day, so for 3 days, she earns:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

She has to pay $3 for parking each day, so for 3 days, her parking costs are:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After paying for parking, her total earnings are:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she earns per hour, we divide her total earnings by the total hours worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa's net pay per hour after expenses is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books for $16 each, so he spends \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars on books. He also buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so he spends \(3 \times 6 = 18\) dollars on pencils. To find out how much he spent in total, we add the money spent on books and pencils: \(48 + 18 = 66\) dollars.

So, the total amount Ted spent is \(\boxed{66}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - So, the number of intervals between the bottles is \( \frac{24}{3} = 8 \).
   - Since there is a bottle at the start and one at the end of each interval, the total number of bottles is \( 8 + 1 = 9 \).

2. **Calculate the total time:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.
   - There are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles.
   - So, the total time is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) seconds.

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{40}\) seconds."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. He ordered 2 boxes, and each box has 40 apples. So, we multiply 40 by 2:
   \[
   40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. Now, Uncle Franky wants to pack these apples into packs of 8. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
   \[
   80 \div 8 = 10 \text{ packs}
   \]

So, the number of packs Uncle Franky can make is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much the Parmesan cheese costs. It's $11 per pound, and Amor buys 2 pounds. So, \(11 \times 2 = 22\) dollars.

2. Next, we need to find out how much the Mozzarella cheese costs. It's $6 per pound, and Amor buys 3 pounds. So, \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.

3. Now, we add the cost of both cheeses to find the total cost. So, \(22 + 18 = 40\) dollars.

4. Amor starts with $50. After buying the cheese, she will have \(50 - 40 = 10\) dollars left.

So, the money Amor will have left to buy meat is \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **How much money did Jim borrow for college?**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 each year for 4 years.
   - So, $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **How much money would Jim have earned if he had worked instead of going to college?**
   - Jim's job paid $25,000 per year.
   - In 4 years, he would have earned $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **How much money did Jim lose by not working during college?**
   - The money he lost is the same as what he would have earned, which is $100,000.

4. **How much money does Jim need to earn to pay off his loans and the money he lost?**
   - He needs to pay back $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost money) = $300,000.

5. **How much money does Jim earn now with his new job?**
   - His new job pays him three times his old job, so $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

6. **How long will it take Jim to earn $300,000?**
   - He needs to earn $300,000 and he earns $75,000 per year.
   - So, $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

**Final Answer:**
4 years"
"Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

First, let's find the new dimensions for the fabric:
- The length of the fabric will be 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet.
- The width of the fabric will be 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet.

Now, let's find the area of one piece of fabric:
- The area is length times width, so 8 feet times 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
- 80 square feet times 2 = 160 square feet.

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's deliveries. One-fifth of 425 is 85, so on Tuesday they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday. Twice 102 is 204, so on Wednesday they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

To find out how many letters they delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add up the letters from each day:
425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

So, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much the chicken salad will cost. There are 10 people who want chicken salad, and each one costs $6.50. So, we multiply 10 by $6.50:
   \[
   10 \times 6.50 = 65
   \]
   So, the chicken salad will cost $65.

2. Next, we need to find out how much the pasta salad will cost. There are 6 people who want pasta salad, and each one costs $6. So, we multiply 6 by $6:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]
   So, the pasta salad will cost $36.

3. Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total cost:
   \[
   65 + 36 = 101
   \]

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.

The final answer is:

"Johnny's dad went to watch horse racing and bet money. Here's what happened:

1. In the first race, he lost $5.
2. In the second race, he won $11 (which is $1 more than twice the $5 he lost).
3. In the third race, he lost $16.50 (which is 1.5 times the $11 he won).

Now, let's add up the losses and wins:

- Total loss: $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50
- Total win: $11 (second race)

Net result:
- Net loss: $21.50 (total loss) - $11 (total win) = $10.50

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{10.50}{3} = 3.5
\]

So, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many cities there are in South America. We know there are 26 countries, and each country has 5 cities. So, we multiply 26 by 5:
   \[
   26 \times 5 = 130
   \]
   So, there are 130 cities in South America.

2. Next, we need to find out how many people live in all these cities. We know that each city has 1000 people. So, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city:
   \[
   130 \times 1000 = 130,000
   \]

So, the total number of people in South America, based on the given information, is:
\[
\boxed{130000}

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

First, we need to know how tall Xavier and Cole are now.

Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches} \]
So, Xavier's new height is:
\[ 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was already 50 inches tall and grew 2 more inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:
\[ 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Let's say the first person got \(x\) dollars.
2. The second person got \(x + 80\) dollars because they got $80 more than the first person.
3. The third person got twice what the second person got, so they got \(2 \times (x + 80)\) dollars.

Now, we know the total amount is $1920. So, we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Let's simplify this:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[4x = 1920 - 240\]
\[4x = 1680\]
\[x = \frac{1680}{4}\]
\[x = 420\]

So, the first person got \(\boxed{420}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to know how many hours they worked each day. They worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. Since a day has 24 hours, we calculate:
   \[
   24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, they worked 9 hours each day.

2. Next, we need to find out how many days they worked in total. They worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
   \]
   So, they worked for 21 days.

3. Now, we need to find out how many hours they worked in total. We multiply the hours they worked each day by the number of days:
   \[
   9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, the team worked 189 hours in total.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many hours each painter worked. There are 4 painters, so we divide the total hours by 4:
   \[
   \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
   \]
   So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

The answer is 47.25 hours."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say Rory retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set.
2. In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he got \( x + 4 \) balls.
3. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he got \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
4. The total number of balls he retrieved is 19.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
Multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 5x = 30 \]
Divide by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, let's find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

1. Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
2. The car loses 21% of its value each year, which means it keeps 79% of its value each year.
3. We need to find the value of the car in 2010, which is 3 years later.

To find the value after 3 years, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Value after 3 years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial value:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"James had an accident, so his insurance cost went up by 60%. The normal cost of the insurance is $120 a month. To find out how much more it cost after the accident, we need to calculate 60% of $120.

First, we find 60% of $120:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the insurance cost went up by $72. Now, we add this to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

James now pays $192 each month. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance."
"Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

First, let's find out how many twin sheets he uses in a year:
- He uses 4 twin sheets per week.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- So, \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets in a year.

Next, let's find out how many king sheets he uses in a year:
- He uses 1 king sheet per week.
- There are 52 weeks in a year.
- So, \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets in a year.

Now, let's see how many loads of laundry he needs:
- For twin sheets, the machine can wash 2 sets at a time.
- So, \(208 \div 2 = 104\) loads for twin sheets.
- For king sheets, the machine can wash 1 set at a time.
- So, \(52 \div 1 = 52\) loads for king sheets.

Finally, let's add the loads together:
- Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets.
- Total loads = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

So, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch:
- 4 movies on Saturday

"Okay, let's solve this together!

Betsy and Donovan made a meal. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The whole meal took 98 minutes.

Let's say Donovan's part took \(D\) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes.

So, the total time is:
\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

This simplifies to:
\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Now, let's solve for \(D\):
\[2D = 98 - 18\]
\[2D = 80\]
\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part:
\[40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long.

The answer is \(\boxed{58}\)."
"Okay, let's add up all the costs step by step:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. So, it's $300 divided by 2, which is $150.
3. **Painkillers**: Each pill costs $4, and she needs 30 pills. So, it's $4 times 30, which is $120.
4. **Parking**: The parking costs $6 per hour, and she needs to park for at least 2 hours. So, it's $6 times 2, which is $12.

Now, let's add all these up:
$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

So, the total cost is $482.

The answer is: \boxed{482}"
"James gets 80 emails every day. Out of these, 20% don't need any response. So, let's find out how many emails he needs to respond to each day.

First, we calculate 20% of 80:
20% of 80 = 0.20 * 80 = 16 emails

These 16 emails don't need a response. So, the number of emails he needs to respond to each day is:
80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week:
64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 320.

The answer is: 320"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many they ate, we do:
   \[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
   So, they ate 14 pizzas.

2. To find out how many pizzas are left from the glee club's order, we subtract the number they ate from the total they ordered:
   \[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
   So, 6 pizzas are left from the glee club's order.

3. The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
   \[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
   The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. To find out how many they ate, we do:
   \[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
   So, they ate 32 pizzas.

4. To find out how many pizzas are left from the football team's order, we subtract the number they ate from the total they ordered:
   \[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
   So, 8 pizzas are left from the football team's order.

5. To find out the total number of pizzas left, we add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the cost for 1400 big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

The total cost for both small and big coupons is:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total cost in dollars is:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 meatball sub sandwiches.
   - So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, Sidney's 7 sub sandwiches have \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches.
   - Mark ate \(4 \times 4 = 16\) meatballs.

4. After Mark ate, the remaining meatballs are:
   - \(28 - 16 = 12\) meatballs.

5. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   - So, he ordered \(3 \times 4 = 12\) more meatballs.

6. The total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:
   - \(12 + 12 = 24\) meatballs.

So, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

But, 1/4 of the trucks had mechanical problems, so:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means 5 trucks couldn't deliver their fertiliser. So, the number of trucks that could deliver is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 15 trucks had 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
2. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
3. So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

Now, the store has a promotion: ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off.""

1. If he buys 1 pound, he gets another half pound for half the price.
2. The price of butter is $4.00 per pound.
3. So, for 1 pound, he pays $4.00, and for the half pound, he pays $2.00 (half of $4.00).
4. This means for 1.5 pounds, he pays $6.00.

To get 6 pounds, we need to see how many 1.5-pound sets are in 6 pounds:
- 6 pounds divided by 1.5 pounds per set = 4 sets.

So, for 4 sets, he pays:
- 4 sets times $6.00 per set = $24.00.

Therefore, the total cost for 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"Kayla is having a birthday party at a movie theater. The theater charges $125 to rent it for 20 people. For each extra person, it costs $6.

First, let's count how many people are coming:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- 7 girls from her dance class.
- 13 family members.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

But 4 people couldn't come, so the number of people who will come is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The first 20 people cost $125. The rest are 21 people, and each extra person costs $6. So, the cost for the extra people is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Now, we add the base cost and the extra cost:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

So, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Maggie and Riza each have $60 left after spending some of their money. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and Riza spent one-third of her money. We need to find out how much money they have left in total.

First, let's figure out how much money Maggie originally had. If Maggie has $60 left after spending a quarter, it means she has three-quarters of her original money left. So, if three-quarters is $60, then one-quarter must be $20 (because $60 divided by 3 is $20). Therefore, her original amount was $80 (because $20 times 4 is $80).

Next, let's figure out how much money Riza originally had. If Riza has $60 left after spending one-third, it means she has two-thirds of her original money left. So, if two-thirds is $60, then one-third must be $30 (because $60 divided by 2 is $30). Therefore, her original amount was $90 (because $30 times 3 is $90).

Now, we add the money they have left:
$60 (Maggie) + $60 (Riza) = $120

So, the total amount of money Maggie and Riza have left is $120.

The answer is: \boxed{120}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So in a week (7 days), it eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.
2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day. In a week, it eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.
3. The total bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas.
4. Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas in total. So the bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas.
5. Since the third monkey eats the same number of bananas each day, we divide the weekly total by 7: \(147 \div 7 = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he put 250 pieces in place. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, so he put 500 more pieces in place. 

To find out how many pieces he placed in total, we add the two amounts together:

250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces

So, Teddy placed 750 puzzle pieces during that hour.

The answer is 750."
"Jenny bought 15 roses. Each rose costs $1.25. So, the total cost for 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny brought five $5 bills, which is:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should get back is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters, we need to know how many quarters make up $6.25. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

So, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

The answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.
   - Each milkshake costs $5.50.
   - So, the total from milkshakes is \(6 \times 5.50 = 33\) dollars.

2. **Burger Platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.
   - Each burger platter costs $11.
   - So, the total from burger platters is \(9 \times 11 = 99\) dollars.

3. **Sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas.
   - Each soda costs $1.50.
   - So, the total from sodas is \(20 \times 1.50 = 30\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the totals:
- Total from milkshakes: $33
- Total from burger platters: $99
- Total from sodas: $30

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, it leaves after 30 minutes.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 40 minutes from the start. It stays for 5 minutes (which is a quarter of 20 minutes). So, it leaves after 45 minutes.
3. The third train arrives 60 minutes from the start and leaves immediately after arriving.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 80 minutes from the start. This is the train Paul will board.

Paul arrives at the station at the start (0 minutes). The fourth train arrives at 80 minutes. Therefore, Paul will wait for 80 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
80"
"Melanie has been saving toothpicks for 12 weeks, and she saves 10 toothpicks each week. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs 200 toothpicks in total. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of weeks she needs to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The original price of the watch is $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price. So, he paid:
   \[
   2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, his friend paid:
   \[
   1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
4. The friend bought the watch for $1800, but the original price was $2000. So, the discount is:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
5. To find the percentage discount, we use:
   \[
   \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. **How many jellyfish does one spring make in one second?**
   - One jellyfish.

2. **How many seconds are there in one minute?**
   - 60 seconds.

3. **How many seconds are there in one hour?**
   - 60 seconds per minute × 60 minutes = 3600 seconds.

4. **How many seconds are there in 4 hours?**
   - 3600 seconds per hour × 4 hours = 14400 seconds.

5. **How many jellyfish does one spring make in 4 hours?**
   - Since one spring makes 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will make 14400 jellyfish.

6. **How many jellyfish do 5 springs make in 4 hours?**
   - If one spring makes 14400 jellyfish, then 5 springs will make 5 × 14400 = 72000 jellyfish.

So, the answer is:
```
72000

"Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Binkie's score was 90. So, twice Binkie's score is \(2 \times 90 = 180\). Then, adding 15 to 180 gives Frankie's score: \(180 + 15 = 195\).

Frankie's score is 195."
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles. Then he had to walk back home, another 2 miles. So, he walked a total of 4 miles.

He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it took him, we divide the distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took him 1 hour to reach the point where he realized he forgot something.

\[
\text{Answer: } 1 \text{ hour}

"Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she got 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas in total.

If she bought each banana individually, it would cost her $0.80 per banana. So, for 40 bananas, it would be 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

But she bought the bananas in bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00. So, for 10 bunches, it would be 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much money she saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

The answer is $2.00."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.
3. Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.
4. The total fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get, so \( S + (S + 60) = 100 \).
5. This simplifies to \( 2S + 60 = 100 \).
6. Subtract 60 from both sides: \( 2S = 40 \).
7. Divide both sides by 2: \( S = 20 \).

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how much it grows each year, we divide 8 inches by 4 years:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Now, we want to know how much it will grow in 13 years. Since it grows 2 inches each year, we multiply 2 inches by 13 years:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Trekking Bikes**: Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - So, \(300 \div 2 = 150\) Trekking bikes.

2. **BMX Bikes**: 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - So, \(300 \times 0.15 = 45\) BMX bikes.

3. **MTB Bikes**: The rest were MTB bikes.
   - So, \(300 - 150 - 45 = 105\) MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the money made from each type of bike:

1. **Trekking Bikes**: Each Trekking bike costs $450.
   - So, \(150 \times 450 = 67500\) dollars.

2. **BMX Bikes**: Each BMX bike costs half of an MTB, so \(500 \div 2 = 250\) dollars.
   - So, \(45 \times 250 = 11250\) dollars.

3. **MTB Bikes**: Each MTB bike costs $500.
   - So, \(105 \times 500 = 52500\) dollars.

Finally, let's add up all the money made:
- \(67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250\) dollars.

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour.
2. The truck takes away 3 bales of hay each hour.
3. So, each hour, the farmer makes 5 bales and the truck takes away 3 bales, which means 2 bales are left in the field each hour.
4. If they work for 6 hours, we need to find out how many bales are left after 6 hours.
5. Since 2 bales are left each hour, after 6 hours, the number of bales left will be \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is **12**."
"John has 8 classes each day, and each class is 40 minutes long. He goes to class 5 days a week, so the total time he spends in classes during the week is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

On the weekend, he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each day. So, the time he spends on each day of the weekend is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time gives:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many hours he spends learning, we divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

But the question asks for the total time spent learning in hours, and the correct answer is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final answer is:

"Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to 2/3 of its starting height with each bounce. He drops it from the third-floor balcony, where each story is 24 feet high. First, we need to find out how high the ball is dropped from:

3 stories × 24 feet/story = 72 feet

After the first bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of 72 feet:

72 feet × 2/3 = 48 feet

After the second bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3 of 48 feet:

48 feet × 2/3 = 32 feet

So, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is 32 feet."
"Sure, let's figure out the heights step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert 6 feet to inches:
   \[6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches}\]

2. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child:
   \[72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}\]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}\]

4. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child:
   \[69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}\]

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that each bag contains 10 apples.
2. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples.
3. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   \[
   \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
   \]
4. Each bag is sold for $5.
5. To find out how much the orchard earned, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
   \[
   200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. So, if the triceratops had \( x \) kilograms of meat, the T-Rex ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.

2. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left. So, they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.

3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms. So, \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiply both sides by 4:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.

The answer is \(\boxed{1080}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the area of the north and south walls:**
   - Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet.
   - So, the area of one wall is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.

2. **Calculate the area of the east and west walls:**
   - Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet.
   - So, the area of one wall is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet.
   - Since there are two walls, the total area is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

3. **Add the areas together to get the total area to be painted:**
   - Total area = \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

4. **Calculate how many gallons of paint are needed:**
   - One gallon covers 20 square feet.
   - So, the number of gallons needed is \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) gallons.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each gallon costs $12.
   - So, the total cost is \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars.

The cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them.
2. She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, so now there are 2 unshaken sodas left.
3. Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So now there are:
   - 2 - 1 = 1 unshaken soda left
   - 3 - 1 = 2 shaken sodas left

Now, there are 8 sodas left in total (1 unshaken + 2 shaken).

The chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ shaken sodas}}{8 \text{ total sodas}} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To change this to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 25\% \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

1. The first train is going 60 miles every hour.
2. The second train is going half as fast, so it's going 30 miles every hour (because 60 divided by 2 is 30).

Now, let's see how far each train goes in 3 hours:

- The first train goes 60 miles in 1 hour, so in 3 hours, it goes \(60 \times 3 = 180\) miles.
- The second train goes 30 miles in 1 hour, so in 3 hours, it goes \(30 \times 3 = 90\) miles.

To find out how far apart they are, we add the distances they each traveled:

- \(180 + 90 = 270\) miles.

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.

The final answer is 270 miles."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many days there are from March 1st to April 19th.
   - March has 31 days.
   - From March 1st to March 31st, that's 31 days.
   - From April 1st to April 19th, that's 19 days.
   - So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

2. Billy takes 20% of these days off. Let's find out how many days that is.
   - 20% of 50 days is 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
   - So, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

3. Now, we need to find out how many people Billy helps each day.
   - Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
   - So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

4. Finally, we need to find out how many people he helps in total.
   - If he helps 6 people each day and works for 40 days, then he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. We know there were 12 buses and each bus can carry 35 people.
2. So, the total number of people the buses can carry is:
   \[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

3. We also know there were 20 cars and each car can carry 3 people.
4. So, the total number of people the cars can carry is:
   \[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

5. To find out the total number of people that could have been transported, we add the number of people from the buses and the cars:
   \[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

So, the maximum number of people that could have been inside the church is 480.

The answer is: \boxed{480}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Mike is 24 years old.
2. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we subtract 4 from 24:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20
   \]
   So, Martha is 20 years old.
3. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age:

   So, Jeff is 30 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to do some simple math.

For the biggest slide:
- It is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.
- So, the time it takes is 300 feet ÷ 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide:
- It is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.
- So, the time it takes is 240 feet ÷ 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes.

Now, we find the difference in time:
- The biggest slide takes 5 minutes.
- The second biggest slide takes 3 minutes.
- So, the difference is 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

The answer is 2 minutes."
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. 

First, let's add up the time for his breaks:
- Two 15-minute breaks equal \(2 \times 15 = 30\) minutes.

Now, add the lunch time:
- 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes.

Since 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour, Bobby spends 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Over 5 days, the total time is:
- 1 hour/day \(\times\) 5 days = 5 hours.

So, the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks after 5 days is 5 hours.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. So, we multiply 8 by 3.5:
   \[ 8 \times 3.5 = 28 \text{ miles} \]
3. Together, Amber and Micah ran:
   \[ 8 + 28 = 36 \text{ miles} \]
4. The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. So, to find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distance run by Amber and Micah from the total:
   \[ 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Sheila first charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, we find 20% of $20.00:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then we subtract $4.00 from $20.00:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. First, we find 10% of $30.00:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then we subtract $3.00 from $30.00:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. Now we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]
6. Finally, we add the new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large. So if there are \( J \) jellyfish in total, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

2. A third of these large jellyfish change color to blue when a UV light is on. So the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

3. The problem tells us that 6 jellyfish changed color. So we can write the equation:
   \[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

4. To find \( J \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
   \[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
   \[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know Chris is 4 years old.
2. Ben is two times older than Chris, so Ben's age is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

So, Caroline is \(\boxed{24}\) years old."
"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate how much money Lauren needs for retirement:**
   - Lauren wants to live on 40% of her current salary each year.
   - Her current salary is $100,000.
   - So, she needs $100,000 × 0.40 = $40,000 each year for retirement.
   - She plans to live off this for 20 years.
   - Therefore, she needs $40,000 × 20 = $800,000 for her retirement.

2. **Calculate how much Lauren saves each year:**
   - Lauren saves 20% of her salary each year.
   - So, she saves $100,000 × 0.20 = $20,000 each year.

3. **Calculate how many years Lauren needs to save $800,000:**
   - She needs $800,000 and saves $20,000 each year.
   - So, she needs $800,000 ÷ $20,000 = 40 years.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement.

**Answer: 40 years**"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon.
2. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25
   \]
   Each part is 25 centimeters long.
3. Now, each of these 25-centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5
   \]
   Each final part is 5 centimeters long.

So, the length of each final cut is 5 centimeters.

The answer is: \boxed{5}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.
2. To find the total population, we need to figure out what 100% is. If 40% is 240, then 1% would be \( \frac{240}{40} = 6 \).
3. So, 100% (the total population) would be \( 6 \times 100 = 600 \).

Now, we know the total population is 600. Since 40% are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.
4. To find the number of girls, we calculate 60% of 600: \( 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \).

So, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

3. The total cost before the coupon is $19 + $26 = $45.
4. She used a coupon for $7 off.
5. So, the total cost after the coupon is $45 - $7 = $38.

Therefore, the amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: \boxed{38}"
"Sure, let's figure this out together!

We have 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels. 

First, we need to find out the total height of all the heels:
- For the 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches
- For the 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches

Now, we add these together to get the total height:
\(12 + 6 = 18\) inches

Next, we need to find the average height. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\(\frac{18}{6} = 3\) inches

So, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. 

First, let's find out how many miles she plans to hike each day:
\[ 125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to finish 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."
"Sure, let's figure out how much money the store will make from selling all the balls.

First, we need to find out how much money the store will get from selling the red balls. There are 3 red balls and each red ball costs $9. So, we multiply 3 by 9:
\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]
So, the store will get $27 from the red balls.

Next, we calculate the money from the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls and each blue ball costs $5. So, we multiply 11 by 5:
\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \]
So, the store will get $55 from the blue balls.

Then, we find out how much money the store will get from the green balls. There are 25 green balls and each green ball costs $3. So, we multiply 25 by 3:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]
So, the store will get $75 from the green balls.

Finally, we add up all the money from the red, blue, and green balls to find the total amount of money the store will get:
\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

So, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."

"Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class. This year, there are more students because the number increased by 20%.

To find out how many more students there are, we need to calculate 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more students this year. 

To find the total number of students this year, we add the 10 new students to the 50 students from last year:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, we know the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. To find out how many times it blinks in one minute, we divide 255 by 5:

\[ 255 \div 5 = 51 \]

So, the light blinks 51 times every minute.

Now, we want to know how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times. Since we know it blinks 51 times in one minute, we can find out how many minutes it will take by dividing 459 by 51:

\[ 459 \div 51 = 9 \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

The answer is \(\boxed{9}\) minutes."
"Sure, let's count the fish Tate has step by step.

First, we count the guppies:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Tate buys: 2 more male guppies and 1 more female guppy
- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8

Next, we count the goldfishes:
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5
- Tate buys: 2 more male goldfishes and 3 more female goldfishes
- Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, we add up all the male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has:
- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know that 5 workers are making toys. 2 workers make 6 toys each per hour, and another 2 workers make 4 toys each per hour.
2. So, the first 2 workers make \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
3. The next 2 workers make \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
4. Together, the first 4 workers make \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.
5. Since they work for 10 hours, the first 4 workers make \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys in total.
6. The order needs 400 toys, and after the first 4 workers, 20 toys are still needed. So, the 5th worker must have made \(400 - 200 - 20 = 180\) toys.
7. Since the 5th worker worked for 10 hours, the number of toys made per hour by the 5th worker is \(180 \div 10 = 18\).

So, the 5th worker makes 18 toys per hour.

The answer is: \(\boxed{18}\)"
"Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog, so that dog weighs 15 pounds (because 60 divided by 4 is 15). Elijah also has another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog, so that dog weighs 30 pounds (because 60 divided by 2 is 30).

To find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights together:
- Kory's dog: 60 pounds
- Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
- Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

So, the total weight is 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's say Arnold painted \( A \) eggs, so Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs, so Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

Now, let's write down what we know in equations:
- Arnold and Madeline together: \( A + A = 2A \)
- Camden and Sarah together: \( S + (S + 12) = 2S + 12 \)
- Total eggs: \( 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \)

Let's solve for \( S \) first:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now we know Sarah painted 9 eggs. So, Camden painted:
\[ S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline:
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs. Camden painted 21 eggs. The difference is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold.

The final answer is:

"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into groups of 8 and put each group into a box. Each box weighs 8 ounces and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's find out how many boxes Nik will need:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/box}} = 25 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of the crayons:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Then, we calculate the weight of the boxes:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the weight of the crayons and the boxes:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

Their mother earns twice what Valerie and her brother earn together, so she earns $15000 \times 2 = $30000 per month. The total amount of money they all have together is $5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mother) = $45000 per month.

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, making a total of 3 miles.
2. We know she spends 40 minutes on the beach.
3. The beach part is 2 miles, and she spends 40 minutes on it. So, her speed on the beach is 2 miles in 40 minutes.
4. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed of the beach. So, her speed on the sidewalk is 1 mile in 20 minutes (since 40 minutes divided by 2 is 20 minutes).
5. The sidewalk part is 1 mile, and at her speed of 1 mile in 20 minutes, it will take her 20 minutes.
6. So, the total time is 40 minutes (beach) + 20 minutes (sidewalk) = 60 minutes.

The total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{60}\) minutes."
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks. Let's see how much she has saved so far:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract what she has from her goal:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount she needs by the amount she saves each week:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

"Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug has an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle, he is now able to drink the water. 

To find out the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to make sure the mixture in the water bottle is at least 40 degrees. 

Let's say the temperature of the second mug is \( T \) degrees. When Donny mixes 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, the mixture should be at least 40 degrees.

The formula to find the temperature of the mixture is:
\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 68
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

The answer is: \(\boxed{68}\)"

2. Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows each day for 21 days (3 weeks).
3. Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens each day for 21 days (3 weeks).

First, let's find out how many cows are added:
- 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows

Now, let's find out how many chickens are added:
- 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Next, we add these to the initial numbers:
- Total cows: 50 (initial) + 420 (added) = 470 cows
- Total chickens: 20 (initial) + 210 (added) = 230 chickens

Finally, we add the total cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:
- Total animals: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is **700**."
"Russell orders his favorite bagels online. Each pack has 9 bagels and costs $10.00. If he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount.

First, let's find out how much 4 packs cost before the discount:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the discount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Russell gets 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost of each single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost of each single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find out how many scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - So, \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Understand the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This means \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - So, for 1 scoop, you need \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop needs \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will need \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} \).
   - \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

So, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days. So, in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

Then, he increases it to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days. So, in the next 30 days, he eats:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together, the total number of eggs he eats in 60 days is:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens 240 eggs make:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. First, we know there are 17 green jelly beans.
2. The problem says there are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones. So, if there are 17 green jelly beans, then there are \(2 \times 17 = 34\) red jelly beans.
3. Now, we add the green and red jelly beans together: \(17 + 34 = 51\).
4. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. So, to find out how many are blue, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total: \(60 - 51 = 9\).

So, the number of blue jelly beans is \(9\).

The answer is: \(\boxed{9}\)"
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each tree gives him 6 lemons every year. So, in one year, he gets \(5 \times 6 = 30\) lemons. 

Now, a decade means 10 years. So, in 10 years, he will get \(30 \times 10 = 300\) lemons.

The answer is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9.
2. The total number of passengers is 84.
3. Let's say the number of men is 5 parts and the number of women is 9 parts. So, the total parts are 5 + 9 = 14 parts.
4. Each part represents \( \frac{84}{14} = 6 \) people.
5. So, the number of men is \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) and the number of women is \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \).
6. If 20 women leave the bus, the number of women left is \( 54 - 20 = 34 \).

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

The answer is: \boxed{34}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sunflowers sold individually:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers each day.
   - So, the number of individual sunflowers sold each day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

2. **Bouquets sold:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets each day.
   - So, the number of bouquets sold each day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

3. **Sunflowers in bouquets:**
   - Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers in bouquets sold each day is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

4. **Total sunflowers sold each day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold each day is the sum of individual sunflowers and those in bouquets.
   - So, \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

5. **Total sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days is \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Adam has $100 to spend.
2. He buys rocks for $5 each.
3. He can buy \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \) rocks.
4. He sells 60% of his rocks. So, \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) rocks.
5. He sells each rock for $7, so his revenue is \( 12 \times 7 = 84 \) dollars.
6. His loss is the money he spent minus the money he got from selling, which is \( 100 - 84 = 16 \) dollars.

So, the money Adam loses is \( \boxed{16} \)."
"Lauren can draw:
- 5 large-sized pictures per day
- 6 medium-sized pictures per day
- 7 small-sized pictures per day

She needs to draw:
- 45 large-sized pictures
- 36 medium-sized pictures
- 49 small-sized pictures

To find out how many days it will take her, we need to divide the number of pictures by how many she can draw in a day.

For large-sized pictures:
\[
\frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

For medium-sized pictures:
\[
\frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ days}
\]

For small-sized pictures:
\[
\frac{49}{7} = 7 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we add up all the days:
\[
9 + 6 + 7 = 22 \text{ days}
\]

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to draw all the pictures."
"Chatty has 3 dozen eggs for her 4 children. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs would be \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs. If she divides these 36 eggs equally among her 4 children, each child would get \(36 \div 4 = 9\) eggs.

So, each child gets 9 eggs.

Answer: 9"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jen has 3 fish.
2. Each fish needs $1 worth of food a day.
3. So, for 3 fish, the daily cost is \(3 \times 1 = \$3\).
4. May has 31 days.
5. Therefore, the total cost for May is \(31 \times 3 = \$93\).

So, Jen spends \(\boxed{93}\) dollars on food for her fish in the month of May."
"Patricia starts with 30 roses. She gives 24 roses to her mother, so she has:
\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \]
Then she buys 15 more roses, so she has:
\[ 6 + 15 = 21 \]

So, Patricia now has 21 roses. The answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To find out the average speed, we need to know the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

First, let's add up the distances:
- Sid traveled 110 miles and then 140 miles.
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Next, let's add up the time:
- Sid took 2 hours for the first part and 3 hours for the second part.
- Total time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
- Average speed = Total distance / Total time
- Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step!

1. Mark buys two lottery tickets.
2. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That means out of 100 chances, it wins 20 times.
3. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first one wins 20 times out of 100, the second one wins 3 times as much, which is 60 times out of 100.
4. To find the chance that both tickets win, we multiply their chances together:
   - First ticket: 20 out of 100
   - Second ticket: 60 out of 100
5. So, the chance that both win is:
   \[ \frac{20}{100} \times \frac{60}{100} = \frac{1200}{10000} = 0.12 \]
6. To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(22 \div 2 = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's add up all the seashells:
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person gets:
\[60 \div 3 = 20\]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots during the weekdays.

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. That's 2 days, so he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots on the weekend.

Adding the carrots from weekdays and weekends together, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots in a week.

So, the answer is 30."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we need to add 60% of 5 minutes to 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes is:
0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is:
5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:
5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus bought mobile devices and sold them for a profit. He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday. Each device cost him $20.

First, let's find out how much he spent in total:
- He bought 2 devices on Monday: \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- He bought 4 devices on Tuesday: \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.
- So, the total cost is \(40 + 80 = 120\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much he sold each device for:
- He sold each device for twice the cost: \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much he earned from selling all the devices:
- He sold 6 devices in total: \(6 \times 40 = 240\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate his profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost: \(240 - 120 = 120\) dollars.

So, the profit Linus earned is \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet tall.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the cane is \(6 \div 2 = 3\) feet long.

So, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To help 2300 people get all the energy they need from carrot juice, we need to figure out how many bottles of juice are needed.

1. First, we know that each bottle of juice gives 20% of the energy a person needs in a day.
2. To get 100% of the energy, a person needs 5 bottles (since 100% divided by 20% equals 5).
3. For 2300 people, we need 2300 times 5 bottles, which is 11,500 bottles.

Now, Hortex makes 4200 bottles each day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number they make from the number needed:

11,500 - 4,200 = 7,300

So, Hortex needs to make 7,300 more bottles of juice.

The answer is 7,300."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Carla has 8 octuplets.
2. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, so \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) are in purple.
3. She dresses 1/4 of them in blue, so \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \) are in blue.

Next, we find out how many of them wear bows:
4. All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
5. 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) are in purple and wear bows.

Now, we add the number of bow-wearers:
6. Total bow-wearers = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

Finally, we find the chance that a bow-wearer is wearing purple:
7. Number of purple-wearers wearing bows = 2.
8. Total number of bow-wearers = 4.
9. So, the chance is \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

To make it a percentage:
10. \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \).

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Last week, the IRS got 5168 tax reports in total. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. To find out how many reports they got on Wednesday, we need to do some math.

First, we subtract the reports from Monday and Tuesday from the total:
\[ 5168 - 1907 = 3261 \]

Then, we subtract the reports from Thursday and Friday from the remaining number:
\[ 3261 - 2136 = 1125 \]

So, the number of reports they got on Wednesday is:
\[ 1125 \]

The answer is 1125."
"Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

1. He sells half of it for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters for $50.
2. After that, he has 40 square meters left. He then sells 1/4 of the remaining land for $30. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so he sold 10 square meters for $30.
3. Now he has 30 square meters left. He sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, 30 square meters at $3 each is 30 * 3 = $90.

To find out how much money he earns in total, we add up all the money he got from selling the land:
- First sale: $50
- Second sale: $30
- Final sale: $90

So, the total money he earns is $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

The answer is: \boxed{170}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Haley is 26 years old.
2. We need to find half of Haley's age: \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

So, Geb is 3 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. He goes out three times a day. So, let's figure out how many face masks he uses in 2 days.

First, we need to know how many face masks he uses in one day:
- He goes out 3 times a day.
- He changes his face mask 2 times each time he goes out.
So, in one day, he uses \(3 \times 2 = 6\) face masks.

Now, let's find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days:
- In one day, he uses 6 face masks.
- So, in 2 days, he uses \(6 \times 2 = 12\) face masks.

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.
2. Lamar found 5 eggs.
3. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
4. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
5. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments. So, together they have:
   \[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

2. The third complex is 60% bigger than the 400 apartments. To find 60% of 400:
   \[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]
   So, the third complex has:
   \[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

3. Now, add up all the apartments in the three complexes:
   \[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

4. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. So, the total number of collections per week is:
   \[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

5. He gets paid $0.40 per collection. So, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:
   \[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

So, the money John makes in a week is \(\boxed{1248}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step!

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. If a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits (since it's 20 times 50), then an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. A 9-year-old avocado tree produces 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[

First, we need to find out how much 1/5 of $100 is. 

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gave Jack $20. Now, we add this to the $100 Jack already had:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

\[
\boxed{120}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. So if the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters long, the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters long.

2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So if the yellow rope is \( Y \) centimeters long, the blue rope is \( Y - 7 \) centimeters long.

3. The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   4B + B + Y = 37
   \]
   Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:
   \[
   4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   6Y - 35 = 37
   \]
   Add 35 to both sides:
   \[
   6Y = 72
   \]
   Divide by 6:
   \[
   Y = 12
   \]

4. Now we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long. So the blue rope is:
   \[
   B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
   \]
   And the red rope is:
   \[
   4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. Ronnie was given $5.
2. Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa got:
   \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

3. After giving some money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. This means:
   \[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
   \[ 15 - x = 12 \]
   So, \( x = 15 - 12 = 3 \).

4. Both Ronnie and Rissa gave $3 to their little sister. So, the money left with Ronnie is:
   \[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
2. Half of the mural is yellow, so that's 6 pints of yellow paint.
3. That means the remaining paint for red, white, and purple is \(12 - 6 = 6\) pints.
4. The remaining paint (6 pints) is equally divided among red, white, and purple.
5. So, each color (red, white, and purple) gets \(6 \div 3 = 2\) pints.

Therefore, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

The answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet. So, the area of one bedroom is:
   \[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

2. Tom has 4 bedrooms, so the total area of the bedrooms is:
   \[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

3. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, the area of the living room is:
   \[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

4. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

5. To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:
   \[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds. Each day after that, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before. So, let's count the puffs for each day:

- **Monday**: 3 puffs
- **Tuesday**: 3 puffs × 2 = 6 puffs
- **Wednesday**: 6 puffs × 2 = 12 puffs
- **Thursday**: 12 puffs × 2 = 24 puffs
- **Friday**: 24 puffs × 2 = 48 puffs

Now, let's add up all the puffs:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. A regular box has 100 pods and costs $12.
2. The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
3. 20% of 100 is 20, so the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.
4. The special box still costs $12, so we need to find out how many pods $1 can buy.
5. Since each pod costs $0.10 (because $12 ÷ 120 pods = $0.10 per pod), $1 can buy 10 pods.
6. Since each pod can wash one dish, $1 can buy you 10 dishwashing cycles.

So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Thomas takes out $1000 in 20 dollar bills. He has:
\[ \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills} \]

On the way home, he loses 10 bills:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills} \]

He uses half of the remaining bills to pay a bill:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills} \]
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills} \]

He then triples the money he has left:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

He converts all his money to 5 dollar bills:
\[ \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills} \]

So, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills. The answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **First Half:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. **Starting with 5 inches of chalk:**
   - On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk.
   - So, the chalk left after Monday is \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Using 20% of the chalk each day:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk, which means he keeps 80% of the chalk.
   - Let's see how much chalk is left each day:
     - After the first day: \(2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20\) inches.
     - After the second day: \(2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76\) inches.
     - After the third day: \(1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches.
     - After the fourth day: \(1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches.
     - After the fifth day: \(1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

3. **Deciding when to recycle:**
   - The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
   - After the fifth day, the chalk is \(0.90112\) inches, which is less than 2 inches.

So, the teacher has to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. 

First, let's find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, let's find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, let's add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity} \]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students} \]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[ 24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity} \]

So, the number of students not on varsity is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of face masks that Mike bought. Mike bought 5 face masks. So, thrice the number of Mike's face masks is \(3 \times 5 = 15\). Adding 2 more to that gives \(15 + 2 = 17\).

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The answer is 17."
"James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more than he drills. 

First, we find out how many teeth the dentist caps:
4 (drilled) + 7 = 11 (capped)

Next, we add the teeth that were drilled and capped to find the total number of teeth fixed:
4 (drilled) + 11 (capped) = 15 (fixed)

To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of fixed teeth by the total number of teeth and then multiply by 100:
(15 / 30) * 100 = 50%

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The answer is: 50%"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
2. To find the total cost, we multiply 4000 by $3.5:
   \[ 4000 \times 3.5 = 14000 \]
   So, the total cost is $14000.

3. He found out that 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date. To find out how much milk that is, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \]
   So, 1600 gallons of milk were sour.

4. The cost of the sour milk is:
   \[ 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]
   So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600.

The final answer is: \boxed{5600}"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. Let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).
2. Wendy's current age is five times Colin's age in 7 years. So, Wendy's age is \( 5 \times (C + 7) \).
3. In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old.
4. This age is one-third of Wendy's current age. So, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \).

Now, let's solve the equation:

\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Expand both sides:

\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, let's move all terms with \( C \) to one side and constants to the other side:

\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]

\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many sets of $500 Bob can buy with $27000.
   \[
   \frac{27000}{500} = 54
   \]
   So, Bob can buy 54 sets of $500.

2. Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, we can find out how many books Bob can buy in total.
   \[
   54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
   \]

3. Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.
   \[
   \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
   \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

So, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find out how much Ali's coal order costs, we need to do a few simple steps.

First, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags are needed for 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing 850 by 50:
\[ 850 \div 50 = 17 \]
So, Ali needs 17 bags of coal.

Next, we need to find out how much these 17 bags cost. Each bag costs $18, so we multiply 17 by 18:
\[ 17 \times 18 = 306 \]
So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
2. So, for cheese pizza:
   - 6 friends × 6 slices each = 36 slices
3. For pepperoni pizza:
   - 6 friends × 4 slices each = 24 slices

Now, let's see how many whole pizzas are needed:

4. Cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices per pie:
   - 36 slices ÷ 12 slices per pie = 3 pies

5. Pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices per pie:
   - 24 slices ÷ 8 slices per pie = 3 pies

So, Kate needs to buy:
- 3 cheese pizza pies
- 3 pepperoni pizza pies

In total, she needs to buy:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles each day for 3 days, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 5 miles each day for 2 days, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles.

To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we add the miles from both parts:
\[9 + 10 = 19\]

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week."
"Sure, let's break it down in a simple way!

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs.

First, let's see how many snowballs Jay makes and how many melt in 15 minutes:
- In 15 minutes, Jay makes 5 snowballs (since 20 snowballs in an hour means 5 snowballs every 15 minutes).
- In 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.

So, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is:
- 5 snowballs made - 2 snowballs melted = 3 snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to get 60 snowballs:
- If Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find how many 15-minute intervals are needed to get 60 snowballs.
- \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time is:
- \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

To convert 300 minutes into hours:
- \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer: 5 hours**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it came out 20 years ago.
2. John is currently 28 years old. So, 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
3. When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8, Jim must have been \(8 \div 2 = 4\) years old.
4. Since 20 years have passed since then, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

So, Jim is now 24 years old.

The answer is: 24"
"Doxa ate 1 slice of the apple. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find out how many slices they all ate, we add up the slices:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

So, they all ate a total of 6 slices of apple."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages and ordered 50 more.
   - So, at the end of the first day, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - They had 12 bandages at the start of the second day, so they needed \(28 - 12 = 16\) more bandages.
   - They ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit and have some left over.
   - So, at the end of the second day, they had \(50 - 16 = 34\) bandages.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They used half a pack, which is 25 bandages.
   - They ordered 2 packs, which is 100 bandages.
   - So, at the end of the third day, they had \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\) bandages.
   - But they actually had 78 bandages left.
   - So, they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than 109.
   - Therefore, they started with \(109 - 31 = 78 - 31 = 34\) bandages.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. She works for 4 weeks in April, so she works:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 180 \text{ hours} \]

Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her earnings from working are:
\[ 180 \text{ hours} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jen did not miss any days, she gets an extra $10. So, her total earnings for April are:

"Sure, let's figure out how much money Jason earned step by step.

1. For emptying the dishwasher 6 times, he gets $0.50 each time:
   \[6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\]
   So, he earns $3.00 from emptying the dishwasher.

2. For doing his laundry once, he gets $3.00:
   \[1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\]
   So, he earns $3.00 from doing his laundry.

3. For taking the trash out twice, he gets $0.75 each time:
   \[2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\]
   So, he earns $1.50 from taking the trash out.

4. For cleaning his room once, he gets $1.50:
   \[1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\]
   So, he earns $1.50 from cleaning his room.

Now, let's add all the money he earned:
\[3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. First, we know that one whale has 40 gallons of blood.
2. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, we need to multiply 40 gallons by 3:
   \[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]
   This means one shark has 120 gallons of blood.
3. Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:
   \[ 120 \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people came to the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people came.
3. After some time, twice as many people as at 10:00 came. Since 40 people came at 10:00, twice that is 80 people.
4. By evening, 3 times as many people as in the morning came. Since 50 people came in the morning, 3 times that is 150 people.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:

50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 80 (after 10:00) + 150 (evening) = 320

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.

   - So, the total number of red pens is \(5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens}\).

2. She bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
   - Since there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens is \(2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pens}\).

3. To find the total number of pens, we add the red pens and the black pens together.
   - So, the total number of pens is \(25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}

"John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. That means each bottle of scotch costs $60 because \(600 \div 10 = 60\).

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys \(10 \times 2 = 20\) bottles of cognac. Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. Since a bottle of scotch costs $60, 50% more would be \(60 \times 0.5 = 30\) dollars more. So, each bottle of cognac costs \(60 + 30 = 90\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much he spends on 20 bottles of cognac, we do \(20 \times 90 = 1800\) dollars.

Adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac together, we get \(600 + 1800 = 2400\) dollars.

So, the total amount John spends on everything is \(\boxed{2400}\) dollars."
"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the first day, he planted a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees. So, on the second day, he planted a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

Adding the trees from both days, Mr. Julius planted a total of 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

The problem says: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.""

Let's break it down:
1. Let's say the number of coffee mugs is \( x \).
2. Four times the number of coffee mugs would be \( 4x \).
3. Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs would be \( 4x + 8 \).
4. We know this equals 40, so we write the equation: \( 4x + 8 = 40 \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. First, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
   \[ 4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8 \]
   \[ 4x = 32 \]

2. Now, we need to find \( x \). We do this by dividing both sides by 4:
   \[ \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4} \]
   \[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( \boxed{8} \)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

First, we know there are 66 fish in total. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, we need to find one-third of 66:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the 22 fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, we know that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes. So, we need to find \( \frac{5}{11} \) of 44:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42.

The final answer is:

42"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step:

1. Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each. So, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors from the palettes.
2. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each. So, \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors from the makeup sets.
3. Adding these together, Amy initially had \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

Next, her sister steals one palette with 4 colors. So, \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.

Then, Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set. One makeup set has 6 colors, so she uses \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. That means \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors are left from that set.

So, the total colors left are \(22 - 3 = 19\).

The final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

3. The first floor to the ceiling is 3 times as tall as he is, so:
   \[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]
4. The height of the house is the sum of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. So, the height of the second floor is:
   \[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is \(\boxed{240}\) inches."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells.

2. After team Alphas found their shells, there were \( 700 - 280 = 420 \) shells left.

3. Then, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   - 60% of 420 is \( 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \) shells.

4. After team The finders found their shells, there were \( 420 - 252 = 168 \) shells left.

So, team Gogetters found \( 168 \) shells.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step!

1. We know Bernie has 4 dogs.
2. The average miles they need to walk per day is 3 miles.
3. So, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Now, let's see how many miles the first three dogs need:
1. The first dog needs 1 mile.
2. The second dog needs 4 miles.
3. The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up: \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles}\).

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the miles the first three dogs need from the total miles:
\(12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles}\).

So, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan that is 40% of the house's value. To find out how much the loan is, we do:

\[ 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

So, the loan amount is $100,000.

Next, John uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. To find out how much he uses, we do:

\[ 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

So, he uses $60,000 to pay off his debts.

To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount:

\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the money John has leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000.

The answer is: \(\boxed{40000}\)"
"Deandre caught 3 tunas. The first one weighs 56 kilograms, the second one weighs 46 kilograms, and the third one weighs 26 kilograms. To find out the total weight, we add these together:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, if each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, we need to find out how much 128 kilograms will cost. We do this by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

So, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas."
"Trinity bought the magazines for $72 and sold them for \( \frac{11}{8} \) of that price. To find out how much she sold them for, we need to multiply $72 by \( \frac{11}{8} \).

First, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

So, she sold the magazines for $99.

To find out her profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Low Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the low setting is \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian used it for 3 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the medium setting is \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian used it for 5 days.
   - So, the total water removed on the high setting is \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, let's add up all the water removed:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step!

First, we need to find out how many balloons they started with. They filled 10 packs, and each pack has 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 by 30:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \]
So, they started with 300 balloons.

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to subtract the balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:
\[ 300 - 12 = 288 \]

So, the number of balloons they threw is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Saanvi needs 14 mL of the first medicine.
2. She needs 3 times that amount of the second medicine, so:
   \[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \, \text{mL} \]
3. The total amount of medicine for one dose is:
   \[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]
4. For 8 doses, we multiply the amount for one dose by 8:
   \[ 56 \, \text{mL} \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ \boxed{448} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. Ali's class has 120 students.
2. John's classes each have \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class.
3. So, the capacity of one of John's classes is \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
4. John has two classes, so the total capacity for John's school is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) students.
5. The total capacity of both schools combined is \( 120 + 30 = 150 \) students.

So, the combined capacity of both schools is \(\boxed{150}\)."

1. Stephen borrowed $300 and needs to pay an extra 2% interest.
2. The interest is calculated as \(300 \times 0.02 = 6\).
3. So, the total amount Stephen needs to pay is \(300 + 6 = 306\).

Next, Stephen pays $25 each month for 11 months:
4. \(25 \times 11 = 275\).

Now, we need to find out how much is left to pay in the twelfth month:
5. \(306 - 275 = 31\).

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Jordan has 2 children, and each child needs 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes needed for both children is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

Jordan's wife takes care of half of these changes. So, she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diapers.

Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 and his wife takes care of 5, Jordan changes the remaining 5 diapers.

So, Jordan changes \(\boxed{5}\) diapers per day."
"Tim entered a competition where he had to guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the base and 15 inches tall. Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, and they fit about 80% efficiently. He thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red. The actual number of red jelly beans is 900.

First, let's find the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we find the effective volume for packing the jelly beans:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we calculate how many jelly beans can fit in the jar:
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Tim thinks 30% of these jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The actual number of red jelly beans is 900. So, how far off was Tim's guess?
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The bus can carry 200 people.
2. When it left Chengli city, there were 20 people on the bus.
3. At the first stop, 40 more people got on the bus.
   - So, now there are \(20 + 40 = 60\) people on the bus.
4. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop got on again.
   - \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) people got on at the second stop.
   - Now there are \(60 + 30 = 90\) people on the bus.
5. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubled.
   - So, now there are \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people on the bus.
6. The bus can carry 200 people, so the number of empty seats is \(200 - 180 = 20\).

So, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, which means the new cost is $2 + (150% of $2) = $2 + $3 = $5.

In 5 years, she visited the museum 5 times 3 = 15 times. In the next 3 years, she visited 3 times 3 = 9 times. So, in total, she visited 15 + 9 = 24 times.

Since each visit now costs $5, the total amount she spent is 24 times $5 = $120.

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $120.

The answer is: $120."

"John made 4 wooden tables for his friend Ali. Each table costs $20. So, the total cost for the tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

John also made 2 roof frames for Ali. Each roof frame costs $10. So, the total cost for the roof frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together:
\[80 + 20 = 100\]

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

The answer is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, where the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece. Let's figure out how long the longer piece is.

If we say the shorter piece is \(x\) feet, then the longer piece is \(4x\) feet. Together, they make up the whole board, so:
\[x + 4x = 40\]

This simplifies to:
\[5x = 40\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 5:
\[x = \frac{40}{5} = 8\]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the shorter piece, is:
\[4 \times 8 = 32\]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"Aiden is making meatballs for a cookout. He uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. He can make 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. He wants to make 80 meatballs.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs:
- If 1 pound of ground beef makes 16 meatballs, then for 80 meatballs, he needs:
  \[
  \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds of ground beef}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret seasoning he needs:
- If he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of ground beef, then for 5 pounds, he needs:

"Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If her class has five people and each person gets two treats, we need to find out how many cupcakes Carly made.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's say Carly makes \( c \) cupcakes.
2. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so she makes \( 3c - 2 \) brownies.
3. Each of the 5 people in her class gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).
4. The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we have \( c + (3c - 2) = 10 \).

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c = 12 \]
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."

1. **Manicure and Pedicure Cost:**
   - A manicure costs $35.
   - A pedicure costs $40.
   - The salon gives a 20% discount if you get both.
   - 20% of $35 is \(35 \times 0.20 = 7\).
   - So, the discounted cost of the manicure is \(35 - 7 = 28\).
   - 20% of $40 is \(40 \times 0.20 = 8\).
   - So, the discounted cost of the pedicure is \(40 - 8 = 32\).
   - The total cost for both is \(28 + 32 = 60\).

2. **Nail Art Cost:**
   - Nail art costs $3 per nail.
   - A manicure has 10 nails, and a pedicure has 10 nails.
   - So, the total number of nails is \(10 + 10 = 20\).
   - The total cost for nail art is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for both the discounted manicure and pedicure is $60.
   - The total cost for nail art is $60.

So, the price of the toy after the discount in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Charlie is a tennis teacher. He charges $80 for each hour of teaching. But for his veteran students, he charges 25% less. 

First, let's find out how much he charges for the veteran students:
- 25% of $80 is $80 * 0.25 = $20.
- So, for veterans, he charges $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much he earns:
- He teaches 4 hours at $80 each: 4 * $80 = $320.
- He teaches 2 hours at $60 each: 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding these together:
- $320 + $120 = $440.

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Regina wrote 9 novels last year. This is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. We need to find out how many novels she wrote this year.

If 9 novels are 3 quarters, we can think of it as:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \text{ of the number of novels this year} \]

To find the full number of novels this year, we need to find out what 1 whole (or 4 quarters) would be. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \text{number of novels this year} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 1.3333 = 12 \]

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Michael travels 50 km every hour.
2. He travels for 24 hours each day.
3. So, in one day, he travels \(50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr} = 1200 \text{ km}\).
4. Over 3 days, he travels \(1200 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km}\).

Now, the distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of this distance Michael has covered, we use this formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Covered}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100
\]

So, we have:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
\]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas. The answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice. So, he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, some grapes were left. Let's say there were \(G\) grapes at the start.
4. The grapes left after they ate and used some are \(G - 6 - 30 = G - 36\).
5. Their mother used these remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie needs 12 grapes. So, she used \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
6. This means \(G - 36 = 48\).
7. To find \(G\), we add 36 to both sides: \(G = 48 + 36 = 84\).

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was \(\boxed{84}\)."
"Last Friday, 13 teachers were sick, and 9 substitute teachers came to help. To find out how many teachers were at school, we need to do some simple math.

First, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:

Then, we add the substitute teachers:
69 + 9 = 78

So, the number of teachers at school that day was 78."
"Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. Here's how much it costs him each week:

- He buys 1 box of pasta for $1.00.
- He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese.
- He spends twice as much on gruyere cheese, so that's $3.00 x 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Gruyere cheese: $6.00

Total cost per week: $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total cost for the year is:
$10.00 x 52 = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books. Since there are 2 middle shelves, they can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books together.
2. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
3. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the total capacity of one bookcase:
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, one bookcase can hold \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

   \[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

2. The cost of 1 dozen eggs is $2.40. So, the cost for 5 dozens is:
   \[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

3. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. So, for 60 eggs, she can make:
   \[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]
   Since each set is sold for $1, her total earnings are:
   \[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in total to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions is 70 from the first test plus 40 from the second test, which is 110 questions.

2. To find out how many questions she needs to get right, we calculate 70% of 110:
   \[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]
   So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total.

3. Next, we need to see how many questions she got right on the first test. She got 60% of the 70 questions correct:
   \[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]
   So, she got 42 questions correct on the first test.

4. Now, we need to find out how many more questions she needs to get right on the second test to reach 77 correct answers. We subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{35}\)"
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step!

Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them for a party. She makes some strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. She makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is 116. So, we can write:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is:

\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Next, we calculate the total points by multiplying the number of games by the points per game:
\[ 21 \text{ points/game} \times 160 \text{ games} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ \boxed{3360} \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he dropped 5 marbles. This left him with 5 marbles. Then he found 3 more, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. But one of them wasn't a marble, so he had 8 - 1 = 7 marbles left.

So, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

**Answer: 7**"
"To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break it down into simple steps:

1. **Customers Needed to Sell Cars:**
   - For every 2 customers, Jason sells 1 car.
   - To sell 15 cars, Jason needs \(15 \times 2 = 30\) customers.

2. **Telephone Calls Needed to Get Customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
   - To get 30 customers, Jason needs \(30 \times 25 = 750\) telephone calls.

So, Jason needs to make \(\boxed{750}\) telephone calls to sell 15 cars."
"Sure, let's count the flashlights and candles step by step.

**Flashlights:**
- There are 4 people in the family, so they have 4 flashlights.
- There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights. So, \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights for the rooms.
- Adding these together, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

**Candles:**
- There are 8 rooms. Half of them (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each. So, \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
- The other half (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each. So, \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
- Adding these together, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

**Total:**
- Adding the flashlights and candles together, we get \(20 + 36 = 56\).

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Mitchell bought 2 bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, the total number of chips is:

\[ 2 \times 55 = 110 \]

Mitchell's family has 5 members, and if they all get the same number of chips, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:

\[ \frac{110}{5} = 22 \]

So, each person gets 22 chips.

The answer is 22."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The fourth and fifth sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.
4. We don't know the time for the sixth side, but since the problem says you have all 6 sides after the fifth side, we can assume the sixth side is included in the total time.

Now, let's add up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes (assuming it's included as part of the total time)

Adding these times together:

\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5 \]

So, the total time to solve the Rubik's cube is:

32.5 minutes

The final answer is: 32.5"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 20 helmets.
2. The number of robots is half the number of helmets, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
3. The number of helmets is half the number of footballs, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Now, let's add up all the items:
\[
\text{Total number of items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70
\]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"Tim works 6 hours each day answering phones. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he works:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day} \]

It takes him 15 minutes to deal with one call. So, the number of calls he can handle each day is:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

He works 5 days a week, so the total number of calls he deals with in a week is:
\[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how long it takes to dry 6 paintings with the old varnish. Since it takes 7 minutes for one painting, for 6 paintings it will take:
   \[ 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

2. Next, we need to find out how long it takes to dry 6 paintings with the new varnish. Since it takes 12 minutes for one painting, for 6 paintings it will take:
   \[ 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the old varnish. We do this by subtracting the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish:
   \[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer with the new varnish.

"Crista has 20 plants. Some of her plants need different amounts of water each day. Let's figure out how much water she needs in total.

1. Four plants need half a cup of water each. So, for these four plants:
   \[
   4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. Eight plants need one full cup of water each. So, for these eight plants:
   \[
   8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. First, we find out how many plants need a quarter of a cup:
   \[
   20 - (4 + 8) = 8 \text{ plants}
   \]
   So, for these eight plants:
   \[
   8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

Now, we add up all the water needed:
\[
2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

So, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"Phineas Frog had to travel 200 yards to get back home. Half of this distance is on land and the other half is in water. So, he needs to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. So, the time it takes him to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

In the water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, the time it takes him to swim 100 yards is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on land and in water, the total time is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."
"To find out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to figure out how many boxes of popsicle sticks he needs and then calculate the total cost.

1. First, we need to know how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. He needs 56 popsicle sticks, and each box has 8 popsicle sticks. So, we divide 56 by 8:
   \[
   56 \div 8 = 7
   \]
   This means Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

2. Each box costs $2.00. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.

So, the answer is \boxed{14}."
"The main phone costs $20, and each additional phone costs half of that, so each additional phone costs $20 ÷ 2 = $10.

There are 4 additional phones, so the cost for the additional phones is 4 × $10 = $40.

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60.

So, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. First, we need to know how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since 1 dozen is 12 doughnuts, he makes:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many doughnuts he makes in June. June has 30 days, so:
   \[
   120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts in June}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much money he makes from selling all these doughnuts. He sells each doughnut for $2, so:
   \[
   3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alicia drops off 5 blouses each week. Each blouse costs $5.00, so for blouses, she spends:
   \[
   5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 = \$25.00
   \]

2. She drops off 2 pairs of pants each week. Each pair of pants costs $8.00, so for pants, she spends:
   \[
   2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 = \$16.00
   \]

3. She drops off 1 skirt each week. The skirt costs $6.00, so for the skirt, she spends:
   \[
   1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 = \$6.00
   \]

4. Now, let's add up all the costs for one week:
   \[
   \$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
   \]

5. Since she does this every week for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
   \[
   \$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
   \]

So, Alicia spends \(\$235.00\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute. After training, he can speak 2.5 times faster. So, his new speed is:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ words per minute} \]

Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages. So, the total number of words is:

\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute. We do this by dividing the total words by his new speed:

\[ \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

**Answer: 12 minutes**"
"On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, there were 20 more people than the first day, so:
\[50 + 20 = 70\]

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number from the second day, so:
\[2 \times 70 = 140\]

For the rest of the week (days 4, 5, 6, and 7), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, the total for these days is:
\[60 \times 4 = 240\]

Now, we add up all the people Conor saw:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is three times the first 30 seconds, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate is four times the first 30 seconds, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn is \(\boxed{210}\)."

So, Elvis is \(\boxed{54}\) miles from his house now."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Gary bought a boat for $9000.
2. In the first year, the boat lost 30% of its value. So, it lost \(9000 \times 0.30 = 2700\) dollars.
3. The value of the boat after the first year is \(9000 - 2700 = 6300\) dollars.
4. In the second year, the boat lost another 30% of its value. So, it lost \(6300 \times 0.30 = 1890\) dollars.
5. The value of the boat after the second year is \(6300 - 1890 = 4410\) dollars.
6. In the third year, the boat lost 20% of its value. So, it lost \(4410 \times 0.20 = 882\) dollars.
7. The value of the boat after the third year is \(4410 - 882 = 3528\) dollars.

So, the boat is worth \(\boxed{3528}\) dollars after three years."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step!

1. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]
   This means each pig eats 8 pounds of feed every day.

2. Dexter has 5 pigs, so the total feed for all pigs each day is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]
   This means all the pigs together eat 40 pounds of feed every day.

3. There are 7 days in a week, so the total feed for all pigs in a week is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]
   This means all the pigs together eat 280 pounds of feed in a week.

4. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the remaining feed after a week is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - There are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - So, 5 more children join, making it 5 + 5 = 10 children.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - So, 10 children each get 2 more, which is 10 × 2 = 20 new children.
   - Adding these to the 10 children already there, we get 10 + 20 = 30 children.

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children leave.
   - So, we subtract 5 from 30, which is 30 - 5 = 25 children.

So, the final number of children following the truck is:
```
25

"Mamou started with 1,360 meals. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. To find out how many meals she has left, we need to add up the meals she gave out and then subtract that from the total.

First, let's add the meals given out:
64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Now, we subtract the meals given out from the total:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

The answer is 1,218."
"Sure, let's count the money James found:

- He found 1 quarter, which is 25 cents.
- He found 2 nickels, and each nickel is 5 cents, so \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents.
- He found 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so \(7 \times 10 = 70\) cents.

Now, let's add them up:

\[25 + 10 + 70 = 105\]

So, James has 105 cents in total.

The answer is 105."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old. So, the total age of the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\).
2. One brother is 12 years old.
3. The older brother is twice as old as the 12-year-old brother, so the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

Now, let's add up all the ages:
- Sisters: 48 years
- 12-year-old brother: 12 years
- Older brother: 24 years

So, the total age is \(48 + 12 + 24 = 84\).

The total age of all the siblings is 84."
"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which is 30 minutes a day. She does this 5 days a week, so that's 30 minutes/day × 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week. Over 4 weeks, she meditates 150 minutes/week × 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

She also practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) 5 days a week, so that's 60 minutes/day × 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week. Over 4 weeks, she practices yoga 300 minutes/week × 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Adding both, she spends 600 minutes on meditation and 1200 minutes on yoga, which totals 600 + 1200 = 1800 minutes.

So, the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks is 1800 minutes."
"Sure, let's figure out the total square footage of the quilt Octavia is making.

First, we need to know how much each type of t-shirt contributes:
- A small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- A medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- A large t-shirt is 6 square feet.

Now, let's count how many of each type Octavia is using:
- She uses 11 small t-shirts.
- She uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- She uses 6 large t-shirts.

Next, we calculate the total square footage for each type:
- For small t-shirts: \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.
- For medium t-shirts: \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.
- For large t-shirts: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Finally, we add all these together to get the total square footage of the quilt:
- Total square footage = \(33 + 32 + 36 = 101\) square feet.

So, the quilt will be 101 square feet in size."
"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, a small sunflower has:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. So, we need to find 50% of 36 and add it to 36:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 36 = \frac{50}{100} \times 36 = 18 \]
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the seeds from the small sunflower and the large sunflower:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

So, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Each T-shirt costs $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The first T-shirt costs $8.
   - The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 ÷ 2 = $4.
   - So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   - The cost of the shoes is $40 × 0.6 = $24.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.
   - Total amount = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Ryan gets $6 each week for doing chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Then he bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream costs $1.25, so for 4 people, it costs:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his earnings, Ryan has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he wants to go to the movies, and each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one ticket:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor only got half of that, so Igor got \(16 \div 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, and Igor got 2 more than that, so Igor got \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, but some were lost. Let's say Igor brought \(x\) beakers. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29.

So, we can write the equation:
\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[8 + x + 16 = 29\]
\[24 + x = 29\]
\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers. Since Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and these animals are either chickens or cows. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70.

Let's say the number of chickens is \( c \) and the number of cows is \( k \).

We know:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To find \( k \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

So, there are 15 cows. Now, we can find the number of chickens by substituting \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
