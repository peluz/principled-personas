"Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs each day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 eggs to bake muffins. So, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. That means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell. She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 each day at the farmers' market.

The answer is $18."
"A robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber. So, for white fiber, it needs 2 divided by 2, which is 1 bolt. 

In total, it needs:
2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

So, the total bolts needed is 3."
"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. The value of the house increased by 150%, which means the house is now worth $200,000. The total cost for Josh was $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000. So, the profit he made is $200,000 (new value) - $130,000 (total cost) = $70,000.

The correct answer is: $70,000."
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session, he runs:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ meters} \]

He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:

\[ 180 \times 3 = 540 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:

\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed a day. She has 20 chickens, so the total feed needed is 20 chickens times 3 cups per chicken, which equals 60 cups.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 cups plus 25 cups, which equals 40 cups.

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed. So, 60 cups minus 40 cups equals 20 cups.

The answer is 20 cups."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. So, for every two glasses, Kylar pays $5 + $3 = $8. Since Kylar wants 16 glasses, we need to find out how many sets of two glasses that is. 16 divided by 2 is 8. So, Kylar needs to pay $8 for each set of two glasses. That means 8 sets times $8 per set equals $64. 

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer: $64**"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply 20 by 4:
   \[
   20 \times 4 = 80
   \]
   So, Charleston has 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply 80 by 2:
   \[
   80 \times 2 = 160
   \]
   So, Toulouse has 160 sheep.
4. Now, we add up all the sheep:
   \[
   20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can download 2 GB per minute. At 40% of the file, that's 80 GB. It takes her 40 minutes to download 80 GB. Then, Windows forces a restart which takes 20 minutes. After the restart, she has to start downloading the 200 GB file again from the beginning. It takes her another 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB. So, the total time is 60 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

The answer is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he covers 180 miles. Then he turns around because he forgot something. On his way back, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during that time. Next, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering 15 miles. After that, he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering 120 miles. So, the total distance he covers on his way back is 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles. He was 180 miles away from home initially, and he has covered 135 miles on his way back. So, he is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles from home.

The answer is 45 miles."
"Eliza works 40 hours at $10 per hour, so she earns 40 * $10 = $400 for the regular hours. For the extra 5 hours, she gets paid 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour. So for the overtime, she earns 5 * $12 = $60. Adding both, her total earnings are $400 + $60 = $460.

So, the answer is $460."
"In the first month, the program got 60 downloads. In the second month, it got three times as many, which is 60 times 3, so that's 180 downloads. In the third month, the downloads went down by 30%, so it's 70% of 180, which is 126 downloads. To find the total, we add them all up: 60 plus 180 plus 126, which equals 366.

The total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Toula went to the bakery and bought different pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen. Let's calculate the total cost.

For the donuts:
3 dozen at $68 each = 3 * 68 = $204

For the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen at $80 each = 2 * 80 = $160

For the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen at $55 each = 6 * 55 = $330

Now, let's add all the costs together:
$204 + $160 + $330 = $694

So, the total cost is $694."
"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree costs $90 to plant. Each year, it grows 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. We need to find out how many years it will take before he starts earning money.

First, let's see how much money he makes each year from selling lemons:
7 lemons/year * $1.5/lemon = $10.5/year

Now, we need to subtract the cost of watering and feeding the tree:
$10.5/year - $3/year = $7.5/year

This means he makes $7.5 each year after expenses. To find out how many years it will take to earn back the $90 he spent, we divide the initial cost by the yearly profit:
$90 / $7.5/year = 12 years

So, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. If she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) at the green house. So, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) left.

2. Then she sold 2 more to the red house. So, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) at the orange house. After that, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Solving this:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 12 \]
\[ 2x = 36 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 20 students in total. 

1. Twenty percent of these students enrolled in contemporary dance. So, we calculate 20% of 20:
   \[ 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4 \]
   So, 4 students are in contemporary dance.

2. Now, we subtract the 4 students from the total to find out how many are left:
   \[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]
   So, 16 students are left.

3. Twenty-five percent of these remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance. So, we calculate 25% of 16:
   \[ 16 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4 \]
   So, 4 students are in jazz dance.

4. Now, we subtract the 4 students from the 16 to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:
   \[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]
   So, 12 students are in hip-hop dance.

5. To find out what percentage of the total 20 students are in hip-hop dance, we use:
   \[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60%."

"Each train travels 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. So, the total distance each train covers is:

80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

The answer is 230 miles."
"Jill works 50 weeks a year. She earns $20 per hour teaching and $30 per hour coaching. She works 35 hours a week teaching and 15 hours a week coaching.

First, let's calculate her teaching earnings:
- She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week.
- So, her weekly earnings from teaching are \(20 \times 35 = 700\) dollars.
- Over 50 weeks, her total earnings from teaching are \(700 \times 50 = 35,000\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate her coaching earnings:
- She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week.
- So, her weekly earnings from coaching are \(30 \times 15 = 450\) dollars.
- Over 50 weeks, her total earnings from coaching are \(450 \times 50 = 22,500\) dollars.

Now, let's add her earnings from both jobs:
- Her total annual salary is \(35,000 + 22,500 = 57,500\) dollars.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"Claire makes 3 eggs every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week. In 4 weeks, she eats 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, she eats 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens. So, the answer is 7 dozens."
"Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 more miles in another hour. That's 6 miles in 2 hours. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the whole trail. 

To find out how long it should take her to hike the whole trail at 4 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

She has already spent 2 hours, so she has:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The remaining distance is:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 10 liters of orange drink, and it's two-thirds water. So, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

But then, I spill 1 liter of the orange drink. So, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and it's three-fifths water. So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. If Samantha is now 31 years old, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born.

First, we find Raymond's current age. Since Samantha is 31 and Raymond was born 6 years before her, Raymond is:
\[ 31 - 6 = 25 \text{ years old} \]

Raymond had his son when he was 23, so the age difference between Raymond and his son is:
\[ 25 - 23 = 2 \text{ years} \]

This means Raymond's son is currently:
\[ 31 - 2 = 29 \text{ years old} \]

To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract his current age from Samantha's current age:
\[ 31 - 29 = 2 \]

So, Raymond's son was born \(\boxed{2}\) years ago."
"Billy sold DVDs to 8 customers on Tuesday. Let's count the DVDs he sold:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's 3 DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's 4 DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Adding these together, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.

So, the answer is 7 DVDs."
"The candle burns for 4 hours from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Since it melts 2 centimeters every hour, the total amount it will melt is:

2 centimeters/hour × 4 hours = 8 centimeters

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter."
"Kyle bought a book for $19.50 after getting a 25% discount. To find the original price, we need to figure out what the price was before the discount was applied.

If the book was $19.50 after a 25% discount, that means $19.50 is 75% of the original price. So, we need to find the original price.

Let's say the original price is \( P \). Then 75% of \( P \) is $19.50. We can write this as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we divide both sides by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"Marie ordered one chicken meal for $12, 5 packs of milk for $3 each, and 4 apples for $1.50 each. She also bought some boxes of pizza. She paid a total of $50.

First, let's add up the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:
- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk: 5 packs × $3 = $15
- Apples: 4 × $1.50 = $6

Now, add these amounts:
$12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Marie paid $50 in total. So, the amount spent on the boxes of pizza is:
$50 - $33 = $17

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost of one box:
$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2

So, Marie ordered \boxed{2} boxes of pizza."
"Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. 

Each pair of shorts costs $16.50, so for 3 pairs, it would be:
\[ 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50 \]

Each pair of pants costs $22.50, so for 3 pairs, it would be:
\[ 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $42, so for 3 pairs, it would be:
\[ 3 \times 42 = 126 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243 \]

So, Mishka spent a total of $243 on all the clothing items."
"Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons of ice cream that have 15 servings per carton and each carton costs $4.00. We need to find out how much she will spend on ice cream after 60 days.

First, we calculate the total number of servings she will have in 60 days:
\[ 60 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ serving/day} = 60 \text{ servings} \]

Next, we find out how many cartons she needs. Each carton has 15 servings:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Finally, we calculate the total cost for 4 cartons:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Henry made two stops during his bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip. To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we need to figure out the distance from his first stop to the end of the trip and then subtract the 15 miles before the end.

First, we calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end, we subtract 15 miles from 40 miles:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know that one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, so that's $33 times 2, which is $66. 

Now, if we add the cost of both pairs of high heels, we get $33 plus $66, which equals $99. 

The problem says that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. So, if we add five dollars to the $99, we get the cost of the boots. 

So, $99 plus $5 equals $104. 

Therefore, the cost of the boots is $104. 

The answer is: $104."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means if Darrell's age is 7 parts, Allen's age is 11 parts.

Next, we know their total age is 162. So, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
Where \(x\) is the value of each part.

Combining the terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we know that Allen's age is 11 parts, so:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. We add them up: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses, which is 3: 240 ÷ 3 = 80.

So, the average guess is 80.

The answer is: 80"
"John takes care of 10 dogs. Each dog needs 0.5 hours a day for walking and other care. To find out how many hours a week John spends on this, we first calculate the daily care hours for all dogs:

10 dogs * 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours/day

Now, we need to find out how many hours this is in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:

5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. Also, she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \) and the number of gold coins is \( G \).

From the information given, we can write two simple sentences:
1. The total number of coins is 110, so \( S + G = 110 \).
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so \( G = S + 30 \).

Now, we can use the second sentence to help us with the first one. If \( G = S + 30 \), we can replace \( G \) in the first sentence with \( S + 30 \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, to find the number of gold coins, we use the second sentence again:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

The answer is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Raymond has 40 jewels. Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels. Half of Raymond's jewels is 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Answer: 23"
"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the 4 points.

First, calculate 25% of 4:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. Over 30 days, he will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00. So, we need to find out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"John sold his lego sets and used the money to buy video games. He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he got:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he had $5 left. So, the total money he had from selling the lego sets minus the money spent on video games and the leftover money is:

\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set was sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half as much time as the first day. So, on the other two days, he runs for 1.5 hours each day.

Let's figure out how far he runs each day. If we assume he runs at a constant speed \( v \) miles per hour, then:

- On the first day, he runs \( 3v \) miles.
- On the other two days, he runs \( 1.5v \) miles each day, so for two days, he runs \( 2 \times 1.5v = 3v \) miles.

So, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 3v + 3v = 6v \]

We know he runs 60 miles a week, so:
\[ 6v = 60 \]
\[ v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at half the speed she runs. If she skips at 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is 6 miles per hour (because 3 miles per hour times 2 equals 6 miles per hour). Her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour (because 6 miles per hour divided by 4 equals 1.5 miles per hour).

In six hours, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, she runs for 2 hours (one-third of 6 hours) and walks for 4 hours (two-thirds of 6 hours).

Running distance: 6 miles per hour times 2 hours equals 12 miles.
Walking distance: 1.5 miles per hour times 4 hours equals 6 miles.

Total distance: 12 miles plus 6 miles equals 18 miles.

So, the answer is 18 miles."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2, which is 8 years old.

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone. But when she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within 1000 feet. So, the distance outside the dragon's reach where Polly can stand and still hit the dragon is:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pie pieces is 5 times 8, which is 40 pieces. At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces. So, 40 minus 14 equals 26 pieces. 

The number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. So, the total calories in the bag are:
\[ 5 \text{ servings} \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 1250 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in one gram of chips:
\[ \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = 4.17 \text{ calories/gram} \]

Now, you have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and you have already consumed 1800 calories. So, the remaining calories you can consume are:
\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we use the calories per gram we calculated earlier:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. He can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00. He sells each candle for $2.00. If he makes and sells 20 candles, how much profit does he make?

First, we need to find out how much beeswax he needs. Since 10 candles need 1 pound of beeswax, 20 candles will need:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the beeswax and wicks. Since 1 pound costs $10.00, 2 pounds will cost:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Since each candle is sold for $2.00, 20 candles will bring in:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

Finally, we find the net profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, Charlie's net profit is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Meredith writes blog articles. Each article takes 4 hours to write. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, she wrote 5 + (2/5 * 5) = 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 articles.

Now, let's add up the articles she wrote each day:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 7 articles
- Wednesday: 14 articles

Total articles = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, the total time spent writing articles is:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours."
"Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left over. We need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she bought.

Let's think through it step by step:
1. Candice had 80 Post-it notes initially.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. She had 23 Post-it notes left.

So, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using them at work is:
\[ 80 + \text{(number of Post-it notes in the package)} \]

After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 left. So, the equation is:
\[ 80 + \text{(number of Post-it notes in the package)} - 220 = 23 \]

Now, let's solve for the number of Post-it notes in the package:
\[ 80 + \text{(number of Post-it notes in the package)} - 220 = 23 \]
\[ \text{(number of Post-it notes in the package)} - 140 = 23 \]
\[ \text{(number of Post-it notes in the package)} = 23 + 140 \]
\[ \text{(number of Post-it notes in the package)} = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, let's find out how many blue ties he bought:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of each red tie. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent on ties:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"Sure, I'll help with that. The wire is 4 feet long, and we need to cut it into pieces that are 6 inches each. First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet would be:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces we can get from 48 inches. We do this by dividing 48 by 6:

\[ 48 \div 6 = 8 \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many units are in the whole building. There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, we multiply 15 by 8:

\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

This means there are 120 units in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we take 3/4 of 120:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \]

This means 90 units are occupied.

To find out how many units are unoccupied, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

The answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Lloyd has chickens that produce 252 eggs each day. He sells these eggs at $2 per dozen. To find out how much he makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs he has each day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 252 by 12:
   \[
   \frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozen}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate how much he makes each day by selling 21 dozen eggs at $2 per dozen:
   \[
   21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Finally, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
   \[
   42 \times 7 = 294 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"Tom's ship goes 10 miles every hour. He travels from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. So, the distance he covers is 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles. 

On his way back, his ship goes 6 miles every hour. To cover 30 miles, it will take 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours.

So, the time it takes him to get back is 5 hours."
"Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each, and he removes 30 of them. So, the weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, so the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the number of toys he needs to remove is:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 15 \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. For each truck tire, the mechanic charges $60, so for 6 truck tires, the mechanic earns \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars. For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40, so for 4 car tires, the mechanic earns \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars. Adding these together, the total revenue for Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires. For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40, so for 12 car tires, the mechanic earns \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.

The revenue on Thursday is $520 and on Friday is $480. The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

So, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."
"The Doubtfire sisters picked up 7 kittens from the animal shelter. Their mom called to say that their cat Patchy had 3 times as many kittens as the number of adopted kittens, and Trixie had 12 kittens.

First, we find out how many kittens Patchy had:
\[ 7 \times 3 = 21 \]

Next, we add the kittens from Trixie:
\[ 12 \]

Now, we add all the kittens together:
\[ 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 \]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"

"The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds. So, the remaining weight the truck can carry is:

5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = 1245 pounds

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each box:

1245 pounds ÷ 15 pounds/box = 83 boxes

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is 83."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Stephen's initial bill for groceries is $40.00.
2. They added a 25% fee on the $40.00, so we calculate 25% of $40.00:
   \[ 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]
3. Now we add this 25% fee to the initial bill:
   \[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]
4. They also charged $3.00 for delivery:
   \[ 50.00 + 3.00 = 53.00 \]
5. Stephen added a $4.00 tip:
   \[ 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"Sure, let's figure out the total number of raspberries on the bush.

First, we count the raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we multiply 6 by 20:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

First, we add the cost of materials and the jeweler's work:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate 10% of $1300 for insurance:
\[ 1300 \times 0.10 = 130 \]

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the total cost:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"If Marcy works for 40 years, she gets $50,000 each year as her pension. After 20 years, she gets an extra 5% of the pension each year. If she quits after 30 years, her pension will be the original $50,000 plus the extra 5%.

First, let's find out the extra pension:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

So, her total pension after 30 years will be:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Therefore, her annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

**Final Answer:**

"Aleena pays $140 every month for the streaming service. For the first half of the year, which is 6 months, she pays:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half of the year, the charge is reduced by 10%. So, the new charge per month is:
\[ 140 \times 0.90 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]
For the second half, which is also 6 months, she pays:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding both parts together, the total amount she pays by the end of the year is:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"Sure, I can help with that. So, Sophia has driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we need to figure out how many miles she can go with one gallon of gas first. 

If 4 gallons take her 100 miles, then 1 gallon would take her:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, her tank holds 12 gallons. So, if she gets 25 miles per gallon, then with 12 gallons, she can drive:
\[ 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

- 1 boys' basketball team with 5 players.
- 1 coach for the girls' team.
- 1 coach for the boys' team.

So, for one school:
- Girls' team players: 5
- Boys' team players: 5
- Coaches: 2

Total for one school is \(5 + 5 + 2 = 12\).

There are 4 schools, so we multiply by 4:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 175 diamonds. 

Next, the number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds. So, we do 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.

Then, the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we do 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together. So, 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 595.

The correct answer is: 595."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can find the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2:

So, there are 120 boys.

Next, we need to find the total number of students. We do this by adding the number of boys and girls together:

\[ 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Now, we know that for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 5:

\[ 180 \div 5 = 36 \]

So, the number of teachers is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The top level (Level 1) has 16 square feet.
2. The next level (Level 2) will have half of 16, which is 8 square feet.
3. The next level (Level 3) will have half of 8, which is 4 square feet.
4. The bottom level (Level 4) will have half of 4, which is 2 square feet.

Now, let's add up all the square footage:
16 (Level 1) + 8 (Level 2) + 4 (Level 3) + 2 (Level 4) = 30 square feet.

To find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
30 square feet ÷ 4 levels = 7.5 square feet.

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5.

"Cecilia has a new puppy and needs to feed it 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then, she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. One bag of dog food contains 110 cups.

To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of dog food for the first 180 days.

For the first 180 days, the puppy eats 1 cup of dog food each day. So, the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days is:
180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups

Now, we need to find out how many bags of dog food are needed for 180 cups. Since one bag contains 110 cups, we divide 180 by 110:
180 cups / 110 cups/bag = 1.636 bags

Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. So, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

The correct answer is:

"Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can figure out how much laundry David and Raymond do.

First, let's find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we divide Sarah's laundry by 4:
\[ \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we divide Sarah's laundry by 2:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds."
"Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.00. To find out how much he saves, we need to figure out the cost of 18 flowers in both ways and then compare them.

First, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- He needs 6 packages (since 18 divided by 3 is 6).
- Each package costs $2.50, so 6 packages cost 6 times $2.50, which is $15.00.

Next, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- He needs 9 packages (since 18 divided by 2 is 9).
- Each package costs $1.00, so 9 packages cost 9 times $1.00, which is $9.00.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Buying in packages of 3 costs $15.00.
- Buying in packages of 2 costs $9.00.

The difference in cost, which is the savings, is:
- $15.00 minus $9.00 equals $6.00.

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price. The answer is \boxed{6.00}."

\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

So, the total number of thorns is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. The football team played 22 games in total. We know they won 8 more games than they lost. Let's say the number of games they lost is \( L \). Then the number of games they won would be \( L + 8 \).

Since the total number of games is 22, we can write the equation:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost:
\[ W = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Gene has been going on vacations since he was 23 years old and is now 34. So, he has been vacationing for 34 - 23 = 11 years. Each year, he goes on 4 vacations, so he has 11 years × 4 vacations per year = 44 quilt blocks in total.

The answer is 44."
"The first alarm rang 4 times. The second alarm rang 3 times as long as the first, so it rang 4 times 3, which is 12 times. The third alarm rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 divided by 2, which is 6 times. Adding them all up, 4 plus 12 plus 6 equals 22. So, the alarm rang 22 times in total. The answer is 22."
"After working for 5 years, Sylvie's monthly salary increased by 10%. So, her new monthly salary is:

\[ 600 \times 1.10 = 660 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, for the next 3 years, her salary increases by 10% each year. Let's calculate her salary for each of these years:

- **6th Year**:
  \[ 660 \times 1.10 = 726 \text{ dollars/month} \]
  Annual salary:
  \[ 726 \times 12 = 8712 \text{ dollars/year} \]

- **7th Year**:
  \[ 726 \times 1.10 = 798.60 \text{ dollars/month} \]
  Annual salary:
  \[ 798.60 \times 12 = 9583.20 \text{ dollars/year} \]

- **8th Year**:
  \[ 798.60 \times 1.10 = 878.46 \text{ dollars/month} \]
  Annual salary:
  \[ 878.46 \times 12 = 10541.52 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:
\[ \boxed{10541.52} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. If we let the number of copies Harald sold be \( H \), then Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

Together, they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The answer is \(\boxed{8000}\)."
"Christina is planning a birthday party and needs 0.75 gift bags per invited guest because only 3 out of 4 guests show up. She invited 16 friends. To find out how many guests will show up, we multiply 16 by 3/4:

\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

So, 12 guests will show up. Since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply 12 by 0.75 to find out how many gift bags she needs:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so to find out how much she will spend, we multiply 9 by $2:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"Ted the T-Rex needs to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic. An adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad, and a child eats half as much, which is 5 pounds. There are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 children. 

For the adults: 
20 dinosaurs * 10 pounds = 200 pounds.

For the children: 
5 dinosaurs * 5 pounds = 25 pounds.

Adding these together: 
200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds.

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad."
"Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets. To find the total number of pets, we add them all up: 4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28 pets. So, the total number of pets is 28."
Jackson is 4 years old.
"Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds. Lee, who used to be faster, now runs it in 38 seconds. This means Gerald used to be 2 seconds slower than Lee. Since Lee is now 2 seconds faster, we can find out Gerald's original time by adding those 2 seconds to Lee's current time.

So, Gerald's original time was 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. This means he can now run 90% of his original time. To find out his new time, we calculate 90% of 40 seconds.

\[ 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The answer is 36 seconds."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood.

Since there are two cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. So, \(60 \times 2 = 120\) cats.

Next, we need to find the total number of dogs and cats. We add the number of dogs and cats together: \(60 + 120 = 180\).

The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats. So, we subtract 12 from 180: \(180 - 12 = 168\) rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The answer is: 348."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boys there are. The problem says that 2 out of every 5 students are boys. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]
So, there are 80 boys.

Next, we need to find out how many girls there are. Since the total number of students is 200 and there are 80 boys, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]
So, there are 120 girls.

Now, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. The problem says that 2 out of every 3 girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]
So, 80 girls are in the girl scout.

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Harry slept 9 hours. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, which is 6 hours. So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3."
"Freda uses canned tomatoes to make sauce. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, but when she turns them into sauce, they only make 8 ounces of sauce. She made 32 ounces of sauce in total. So, she used 4 cans of tomatoes because 32 divided by 8 is 4. Each can has 3 tomatoes in it. Therefore, she used 12 tomatoes because 4 cans times 3 tomatoes per can equals 12 tomatoes.

The answer is 12 tomatoes."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We start with 30 cars on the motorway. After 15 minutes, some cars drive through, and then in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through. Also, 5 cars take an exit, so they don't have to go through the traffic.

If we take away the 5 cars that took an exit, we have 30 - 5 = 25 cars that actually went through the traffic. Out of these 25 cars, 20 cars drove through in the second 15 minutes. So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes must be 25 - 20 = 5.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The answer is: 5"
"Mary got 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. She already had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, she had 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. 

Tomorrow, she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to her friends and family. That means she will give away 40 potted plants. 

So, after giving away the plants, she will have 80 - 40 = 40 potted plants. 

But she also got 18 new potted plants, so she will have 40 + 18 = 58 potted plants left. 

The final number of potted plants Mary will have is 58."
"Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times. The second friend pressed it 1/4 more times than the first friend, so that's 20 + 5 = 25 times. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times. The third friend pressed it 10 more times than the fourth friend, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 times. 

To find out how many times the doorbell rang, we add all these together: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175.

So, the doorbell rang 175 times."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pages Solo has to read in total. He has to read:
- 4 pages from his Science textbook
- 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook
- 7 pages from his History textbook
- 8 pages from his Geography textbook

So, the total number of pages is:
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages left to read is:
39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days.

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed every day from Monday to Friday. That's 3 glasses of water a day for 5 days, so that's 15 glasses. On the weekends, he drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. So that's 3 glasses a day for 2 days, which is 6 glasses. Adding them together, 15 glasses from weekdays plus 6 glasses from weekends equals 21 glasses. So, John drinks 21 glasses of water in a week.

**Final Answer: 21**"
"To figure out how long it will take for the fog to cover the whole city, we need to understand the rate at which the fog is moving. We know it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. The city is 42 miles wide.

First, we find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles:
\[ 42 \div 3 = 14 \]

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover one 3-mile segment, for 14 segments, it will take:
\[ 10 \times 14 = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. John has 3 boxes, and each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension to find the inner space.

For one box:
- Length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

Now, we calculate the volume of one box:
\[ 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:
\[ 24 \text{ cubic inches} \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, so that's 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours. In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let's figure out how much time he spent watching TV on Wednesday. We know the total time is 7 hours, and we can subtract the time he spent watching TV on the other days.

So, 7 hours (total) - 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) - 1.5 hours (Thursday) - 2 hours (Friday) = 1.5 hours.

Since each 30-minute show is 0.5 hours, we can find out how many 30-minute shows he watched by dividing the time he spent on Wednesday by 0.5.

1.5 hours ÷ 0.5 hours per show = 3 shows.

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The answer is: \boxed{3}"
"Henry baked cookies for a competition. He wanted to bake twice as many as he did last year. But he ended up baking 15 more than he planned. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies and now has 110 cookies.

Let's think about it step by step:

1. If Henry had baked exactly twice as many as last year, he would have baked \(2x\) cookies, where \(x\) is the number of cookies he baked last year.
2. But he baked 15 more than he planned, so he baked \(2x + 15\) cookies.
3. He dropped 5 cookies, so he has \(2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10\) cookies.
4. We know he has 110 cookies now, so \(2x + 10 = 110\).

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[2x + 10 = 110\]
\[2x = 110 - 10\]
\[2x = 100\]
\[x = 50\]

So, Henry baked \(\boxed{50}\) cookies last year."
"If you buy 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon, it will cost you $30.00. But if you use an app that gives you $0.20 back for each gallon, you get $2.00 back. So, you subtract the $2.00 from the $30.00. 

The final cost is $28.00.

So, the answer is: $28.00."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate. She had roll-ups that were 2 wide and 24 long. So, we multiply 2 by 24:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
So, Beatrice ate 48 fruit roll-ups.

Next, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. His roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long. So, we multiply 3 by 14:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]
So, Marcell ate 42 fruit roll-ups.

Now, we add the number of fruit roll-ups both of them ate:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]
So, together they ate 90 fruit roll-ups.

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Julia's boat had a problem while she was on the lake. For every ten feet she rowed, two liters of water came in. It took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, and the shore was 64 seconds away. We need to find out how much water was in the boat when she reached the shore.

First, let's figure out how far she needs to row. Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, and the shore is 64 seconds away, we can calculate the total distance:
\[ \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, the water intake would be:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore. The answer is:

"Each teacher uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons a day, and the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times in each lesson. There are 4 teachers, so let's figure out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.

First, we find out how many lessons are used in total:
\[ 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day} \]

Next, since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times for each lesson, we calculate the total cleanings:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons per day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day} \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned \(\boxed{24}\) times in a day."

"Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone. If Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800 divided by 6, which is 300 photos.

Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo. So, if Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos, then the number of ducks in Jamal's photo is 300 divided by 50, which is 6 ducks.

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photo is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sasha bought some lumber and the prices went up. She has 10 boards that cost $10 each and 5 boards that cost $16 each. 

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- She has 10 boards at $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- She has 5 boards at $16 each, so that's 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost is $100 + $80 = $180.

Now, she sells the boards at the new price, which is 50% more. 

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- The new price is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each, so for 10 boards, that's 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- The new price is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each, so for 5 boards, that's 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price is $150 + $120 = $270.

To find out how much profit she makes, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = $270 - $180 = $90.

So, the profit Sasha makes is $90."
"Katy uses sugar and water in a ratio of 7 to 13. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water, we need to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used.

First, we add the parts of the ratio together: 7 + 13 = 20. This means for every 20 parts, 7 parts are sugar and 13 parts are water.

Next, we find out how much each part is by dividing the total amount by the total parts: 120 ÷ 20 = 6. This means each part is 6 teaspoons.

Since sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by 6 to find the amount of sugar: 7 × 6 = 42.

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is 42."
"John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children. Each pair of shoes costs $60. So, first we need to find out how many pairs of shoes he buys in total. That would be 2 pairs per child times 3 children, which is 6 pairs. Then, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to find the total cost. So, 6 pairs times $60 per pair equals $360. 

So, John paid $360."
"On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles. The next day, the total number of vehicles became 30. This means that the number of vehicles brought in on the second day is \(30 - 10 = 20\). Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

So, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. This was 30% more than Lylah's salary. To find Lylah's salary, we need to figure out what 100% of her salary was. If $40,000 is 130% of Lylah's salary, then Lylah's salary was $40,000 divided by 1.3, which is about $30,769.23.

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is $40,000 plus 40% of $40,000, which is $40,000 times 1.4, equaling $56,000.

Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, her new salary is $30,769.23 plus 40% of $30,769.23, which is $30,769.23 times 1.4, equaling about $43,076.92.

To find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later, we add their new salaries together: $56,000 plus $43,076.92, which equals $99,076.92.

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,076.92."
"Miguel uses 2 pads of paper each week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, in one week, he uses:

2 pads/week × 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

60 sheets/week × 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

So, the answer is 240 sheets per month."
"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, which is 2 times 5, so that's 10 apples. Kael also brought half as many oranges as Morisette, which is half of 8, so that's 4 oranges.

Now, let's count the fruits:
- Morisette: 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits
- Kael: 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits

Adding them together:
13 + 14 = 27 fruits

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, so that's 6 hours each day. For two days, that's 6 hours/day * 2 days = 12 hours. For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than 6 hours, so that's 7 hours each day. For four days, that's 7 hours/day * 4 days = 28 hours. Adding it all up: 8 hours (Monday) + 12 hours (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 28 hours (Thursday to Sunday) = 48 hours. So, Sadie slept 48 hours in total throughout the week.

The correct answer is: 48 hours."
"Rosie can run 10 miles in one hour for the first 3 hours. So, in 3 hours, she runs 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles. After that, she runs 5 miles in one hour for the next 4 hours. So, in 4 hours, she runs 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles. Adding both distances, she runs a total of 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles in 7 hours.

So, the answer is 50 miles."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so a watermelon costs \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.
3. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so an orange costs \(45 - 5 = 40\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for what Dillon needs to buy:
- 4 watermelons cost \(4 \times 45 = 180\) dollars.
- 20 peppers cost \(20 \times 15 = 300\) dollars.
- 10 oranges cost \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

Adding these up, the total cost is \(180 + 300 + 400 = 880\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880 dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The hospital sees 500 people a day.
2. Each person is seen for 24 minutes.
3. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
4. So, the total time spent with patients in a day is 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.
5. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the cost for the doctors is 200 * 150 = $30,000.
6. The hospital charges $200 per hour to patients, so the revenue from patients is 200 * 200 = $40,000.
7. The total revenue is $40,000.
8. The profit is the total revenue minus the cost, so $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits."
"Nissa starts with 60 elves. Then, a third of them quit, which is 20 elves. So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left. After that, 10 more elves quit, so 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

The final number of elves is 30."
"Joseph spent $500 in May. In June, he spent $60 less, so he spent $500 - $60 = $440. To find out how much he spent in total for both months, we add the amounts together: $500 + $440 = $940. So, the total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"Pam and Fred went to a carnival. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times. Together, they rode the roller coaster 2 + 4 = 6 times. Then, each of them rode the luge 2 times, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 times. In total, they rode 6 + 4 = 10 times. Each ride costs 6 tickets, so they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets. The answer is 60."
"On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as much, so that's \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles. The total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from the total. So, \(41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13\).

The answer is 13 miles."
"Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. To find out how much he pays in a year, we need to do some simple math.

First, we calculate the cost for one month:
4 car washes * $15 per wash = $60 per month.

Next, we need to find out how much he pays in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
$60 per month * 12 months = $720 per year.

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Brian originally had 20 video games but lost 5, so he now has 15 video games. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. So, we calculate 3 times 15 and then subtract 5:

3 times 15 is 45, and 5 fewer than 45 is 40.

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

The answer is: 40"
"There are 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, so we take one third of 27:

\[
27 \div 3 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Two thirds of these unicorns are female, so we take two thirds of 9:

\[
9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the subs cost. Rory ordered 2 subs at $7.50 each, so:
\[ 2 \times 7.50 = 15.00 \]

Next, the bags of chips. She ordered 2 bags at $1.50 each, so:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Then, the cookies. She ordered 2 cookies at $1.00 each, so:
\[ 2 \times 1.00 = 2.00 \]

Now, we add all these together to get the total cost before any extra fees or tips:
\[ 15.00 + 3.00 + 2.00 = 20.00 \]

There's a 20% delivery fee, so we need to calculate 20% of $20.00:
\[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]

We add this delivery fee to the total cost of the items:
\[ 20.00 + 4.00 = 24.00 \]

Finally, Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip, so we add that to the total:
\[ 24.00 + 5.00 = 29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \boxed{29.00} \]"
"Mark took a test with 75 questions and completed it at a rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours to finish the test. So, the number of questions he completed is:

\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:

\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Today, he took another test with 100 questions and had 6 hours to complete it. At the same rate of 5 questions per hour, the number of questions he completed is:

\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests, we get:

\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out together. We know there are 12 blue gumballs. The problem says there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. So, if we take four times the number of blue gumballs, that would be 4 times 12, which is 48. Then we add 22 to that, so it would be 48 plus 22, which equals 70. So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The answer is 70."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, to find out how many are semi-automatic, we subtract the automatic and manual cars from the total.

So, 20 (total cars) - 12 (automatic) - 4 (manual) = 4 (semi-automatic).

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we take the number of semi-automatic cars and divide it by the total number of cars, then multiply by 100.

So, (4 / 20) * 100 = 20%.

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know there are 700 bees in total. The problem says there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens.

Let's start with the queens. If we say there are \( Q \) queens, then the baby bees would be \( 2Q \) because there are twice as many baby bees as queens. And the worker bees would be \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \) because there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.

So, if we add them all up, we get:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
So, \( Q = 100 \).

Now, if there are 100 queens, then the baby bees are \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \), and the worker bees are \( 4 \times 100 = 400 \).

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. He works at a job where he earns $10 each hour. If he worked instead of playing video games, he would earn:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

So, Jordan would earn \$140 in one week if he worked instead of playing video games."
"John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. The light bulbs, cups, and roach traps are non-food items. The total cost of the non-food items is $3 + $3 + $4 = $10. There is a 10% tax on the non-food items, so the tax is $10 * 0.10 = $1. The total cost of the non-food items after tax is $10 + $1 = $11. The total cost of the food items is $2 + $3 = $5. So, the total cost of everything is $5 + $11 = $16.

The final answer is: $16."
"Kim has a housekeeping business. He has 3 clients already and is talking to 5 more potential clients. So, the total number of clients will be 3 + 5 = 8.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost for each client is:
- 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each = $4
- 1 pack of cloths at $5 each = $5

So, the total cost for each client is $4 + $5 = $9.

For 8 clients, the total cost will be:
- 8 clients * $9 per client = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income:
- $92 - $72 = $20

So, the profit Kim will make each week is $20.

The answer is: $20."
"John has 10 hectares of pineapple field. Each hectare has 100 pineapples. He can harvest every 3 months. There are 4 harvests in a year because 12 months divided by 3 months per harvest equals 4. So, for each harvest, he gets 1000 pineapples (10 hectares times 100 pineapples per hectare). Therefore, in a year, he can harvest 4000 pineapples (1000 pineapples per harvest times 4 harvests).

The answer is 4000 pineapples."
"Johnny has three Lego sets. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first, so that's 500 times 3, which is 1500 pieces. The third set has a quarter of the pieces of the first set, so that's 500 divided by 4, which is 125 pieces.

To find out how many pieces Johnny picks up, we add them all together:

500 (first set) + 1500 (second set) + 125 (third set) = 2125 pieces.

So, Johnny picks up 2125 Lego pieces."
"Okay, let's break it down in a simple way:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of those 30 bees come back. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees come back.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours come back. So, \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees come back.

So, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

**Final Answer:**
90"
"Brittany and her mom went to the museum. The ticket for a child costs $10 and for an adult, it's $12. So, the total cost for both tickets is $10 + $12 = $22. If Brittany's mom got $8 back in change, it means she gave the cashier $22 (the total cost) plus $8 (the change), which is $30. So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is $30."
"Charlie has 12 friends, and he has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if we divide Charlie's friends by 3, we get Dorothy's friends. That means Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4. That means James has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

So, the answer is 16."
"Steve and Tim are racing to get home from school. Steve lives 3 miles away and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and can skateboard at 264 feet per minute.

First, we need to change the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: 3 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
- Tim's distance: 2 miles × 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, we calculate the time it takes for each to get home:
- Time for Steve: 15840 feet ÷ 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
- Time for Tim: 10560 feet ÷ 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

The difference in time is:
40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Shawnda is helping kids in her neighborhood with their bike tires. She charges 25 cents for each tire. 

- For the bicycles, 5 people came and each had 2 tires, so that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For the tricycles, 3 people came and each had 3 tires, so that's \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For the unicycle, 1 person came and had 1 tire, so that's \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding all the tires together, we get \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost is \(20 \times 25 = 500\) cents. 

To change cents to dollars, we divide by 100, so \(500 \div 100 = 5\) dollars.

So, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, he gets 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost is 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00. If Carl pays with a $10 bill, he will get $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00 in change.

The answer is $4.00."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. A seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants took the last fry, leaving 5 fries.

Now, let's work backwards:

- After the ants took the last fry, there were 5 fries left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon took two-thirds, let's say there were \( x \) fries. The raccoon took \( \frac{2}{3}x \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \). So, \( x = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 48.

The answer is: 48."
"Kimo goes to college and has a set schedule for his classes. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. That means he spends 3 hours each of those days, so 3 hours/day * 3 days = 9 hours. 

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, he spends 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day * 2 days = 8 hours.

Adding these together, he spends 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours each week.

Since there are 16 weeks in the semester, he spends 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours in classes.

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is 272.

**Answer: 272**"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out the total length of each type of baked good in inches.

- For the rolls: \(300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}\)
- For the chocolate croissants: \(120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}\)
- For the baguettes: \(60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}\) (since each baguette is 2 feet long, and 1 foot is 12 inches, so \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches)

Now, we add up all these lengths:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}\]

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 280 \text{ feet}\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"Sure, let's figure out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months.

- Monkeys need 200 bananas every month, so for 2 months, they need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas every month, so for 2 months, they need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.
- Baboons need 100 bananas every month, so for 2 months, they need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Monkeys: 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 800 bananas
- Baboons: 200 bananas

So, the total number of bananas needed for 2 months is \(400 + 800 + 200 = 1400\) bananas.

The final answer is \(\boxed{1400}\)."
"Blake and Kelly are running a contest to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They are using a football field that is 100 yards long.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times. That means he runs 100 yards to the end and 100 yards back, which is 200 yards for one trip. So for 15 trips, he runs:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth to the 40-yard line and back. That means she runs 40 yards to the 40-yard line and 40 yards back, which is 80 yards for one trip. She does this 34 times, so she runs:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

To find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser."
"Raphael bought some school supplies. He got 4 pens at $1.5 each, 2 notebooks at $4 each, and a rim of bond paper for $20. Let's add up the cost:

For the pens: 4 pens * $1.5 each = $6
For the notebooks: 2 notebooks * $4 each = $8
For the bond paper: $20

Now, let's add all these together:
$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (bond paper) = $34

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"Finn originally sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more come out from under a lily pad, so he can see 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so he can see 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles now.

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish} \]

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so:
\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses} \]

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so:

"Sure, let's figure out the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months. The bag originally costs $20, and the price goes up by 20% every two months.

First, we need to know how many times the price will increase in 36 months. Since the price increases every two months, we divide 36 by 2:

\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \]

So, the price will increase 18 times. Each time it increases by 20%, which is the same as multiplying by 1.20.

Now, we need to find out what 1.20 raised to the power of 18 is. Using a calculator, we get:

\[ 1.20^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Next, we multiply the original price by this number:

\[ 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

So, the cost of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $787.32.

The final answer is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we have 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4. So, the total cost for the red cars is:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
So, the red cars cost $20 in total.

Next, we have 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5. So, the total cost for the action figures is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
So, the action figures cost $15 in total.

The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure costs $5, the doll costs:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
So, the doll costs $15.

Now, we add up the cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 \text{ (red cars)} + 15 \text{ (action figures)} + 15 \text{ (doll)} = 50 \]

So, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means she won't earn $35 for each of those hours. So, she will lose $35 \times 3 = $105. If she hires an accountant, it will cost her $90. 

By hiring the accountant, she will save $105 - $90 = $15. 

So, the answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."

1090 + 157 = 1247
1247 + 74 = 1321
1321 + 102 = 1423

So, she spent €1423 in total. Now, let's see how much she has left from her budget.

1500 - 1423 = 77

Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

The correct answer is: €77."
"Sandra needs to make 15 Spanish flans for her school fundraiser. Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs. So, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

So, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, then Seth is \( 2B \) years old.

Next, we know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is:
\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now, let's simplify this:
\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so that's 3 times $25, which is $75. The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so that's ($25 + $75) divided by 2, which is $50. Adding them all up, $25 for the hat, $75 for the jacket, and $50 for the pants, gives us a total of $150. So, each uniform costs $150.

The final answer is: $150."
"Sure, let's figure out the total number of legs Jake sees.

First, we count the legs of the spiders:
- There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs.
- So, \(80 \times 8 = 640\) legs from spiders.

Next, we count the legs of the insects:
- There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs.
- So, \(90 \times 6 = 540\) legs from insects.

Then, we count the legs of the rare mutant invertebrates:
- There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates, and each has 10 legs.
- So, \(3 \times 10 = 30\) legs from the rare mutant invertebrates.

Now, we add all the legs together:
- \(640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\)

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is \(1210\).

The final answer is: \(\boxed{1210}\)"
"Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 16 years old. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 19 years old.

Now, let's add up their ages:
Sally Two: 19 years
Granny Red: 16 years
Sally Four: 8 years
Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

The total age of the four birds is 51 years."
"Jessica wants to pay more than the minimum on her debts. Here's how much she needs to pay each month:

- Student loans: $300
- Credit card: $200
- Mortgage: $500

Total minimum monthly payment is $1000. She wants to pay 50% more than this, so we need to add 50% of $1000 to $1000.

50% of $1000 is $500. So, her total monthly payment is $1000 + $500 = $1500.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply $1500 by 12 (months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes for a big family event. He has 60 potatoes to handle. It takes him about 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and 5 seconds to cut each one.

First, let's figure out the time for peeling:
- 1.5 minutes per potato
- 60 potatoes
- Total time for peeling = 1.5 minutes × 60 = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for cutting:
- 5 seconds per potato
- 60 potatoes
- Total time for cutting = 5 seconds × 60 = 300 seconds
- Convert seconds to minutes: 300 seconds ÷ 60 = 5 minutes

Now, add the time for peeling and cutting:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much it costs to make one gallon of lemonade. It costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost for one gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.

Next, we need to see how much money they make from selling one gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and they get 20 glasses per gallon, so the revenue from one gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.

Now, we can find out the profit from one gallon. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so $10 - $5 = $5.

They made a total profit of $25. To find out how many gallons they sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

Finally, to find out how much they spent on lemons, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost of lemons per gallon: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

So, the amount they spent on lemons is $15.

The answer is: \boxed{15}"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know there are 240 Asians in total and 80 of them are Japanese. So, to find out how many are Chinese, we subtract the Japanese from the total:

240 - 80 = 160

This means there are 160 Chinese participants. We are told that 60 of these are boys. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese:

160 - 60 = 100

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. Zaid earns 6000 dollars per month.
2. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, so:
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, so:
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The remaining amount after rent and car fuel is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. He donates half of the remaining amount to charity, so:
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]
6. The remaining amount after the donation is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]
7. He gives 200 dollars to his daughter and 700 dollars to his wife, so:
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]
8. The final remaining amount is:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]"
"Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs. Adding them all together, we get 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs. So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"Lloyd earns $10 for each hour he tutors. In the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he earned 5 times $10, which is $50. In the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he earned 8 times $10, which is $80. To find out how much he earned in total for the two weeks, we add $50 and $80 together. 

So, $50 + $80 = $130.

The total amount Lloyd earned for the first two weeks is $130."
"The total number of students who voted was 80. The winner got \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes. So, we calculate the votes for the winner as:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60

Since the total votes are 80, the votes for the loser would be:

\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations. So, to find the number of white carnations, we divide 200 by 5:

\[ \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, to find the number of red roses, we multiply 40 by 4:

\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Jean is two years older than Mark. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Jan is 30 years old, so two years ago, Jan was 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 14, and Mark was 5 years older than that, so Mark was 19 two years ago. That means Mark is now 21. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean must be 23.

So, Jean is 23 years old."
"The faster team will win by 8 seconds.

The correct answer is A) 8 seconds."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to understand the chances of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 chances out of 6. That means the probability is:

\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Next, we need to find the chances of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 chances out of 6 for each roll. The probability for one roll is:

\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities for two rolls:

\[ 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \]

Now, we need to see how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by dividing the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

\[ \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"
"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many, so she picked 20 divided by 2, which is 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 plus 10, which equals 30 apples.

Answer: 30"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the hamsters get 5 pieces of straw each, and there are 10 cages of hamsters. So, the total straw for hamsters is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, the rabbits get 20 pieces of straw in total.

The total straw distributed is 160 pieces. So, the straw left for the rats is:
\[ 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, the number of rats is:
\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

The rats are in 3 cages, so the number of rats per cage is:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed to have a 2% monthly interest. Let's calculate how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months.

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
- Total amount after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, Mandy should give Benedict $106.12.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{106.12}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know the cost of buying and transporting the bags. The trader buys each bag for $20 and it costs $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22.

Next, the trader sells each bag for $30. So, the profit per bag is $30 - $22 = $8.

The trader made a total profit of $400. If each bag gives a profit of $8, then the number of bags sold is $400 ÷ $8 = 50.

So, the trader sold 50 bags.

The answer is: 50."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, they spent $20.25 on tickets. Then, they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. So, the cost of food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Next, they went on 2 rides, and each ride cost $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since there are three friends, they split the total cost evenly. So, each friend pays:
\[ \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

So, each of them paid:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. He collects 2 peaches every minute. First, we need to find out how many minutes he spends collecting peaches. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, for 3 hours, he spends:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, if he collects 2 peaches each minute, for 180 minutes, he will collect:

\[ 180 \times 2 = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. For ten ducks, we need to find out how much they need in a day.

First, we calculate the total amount of insects needed for ten ducks in a week:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Now, to find out how much they need per day, we divide the total weekly amount by 7:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the ten ducks need \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the number of trees he gains each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees. Over 10 years, he gains 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 trees. Adding this to the initial 50 trees, he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years. But then, 30% of these trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees. Subtracting the dead trees from the total, he has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

The final number of trees Tom has left is 91."
"On Friday, they put 18 pink flamingos in Sue's yard. On Saturday, they took 6 pink ones and painted them white, so now there are 12 pink and 6 white. On Sunday, they added another 18 pink ones, making the total pink ones 30. So, there are 30 pink and 6 white. The difference is 30 - 6, which is 24. 

So, the answer is 24."
"Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors. Each crayon costs $2, and she has $20. To find out how much change she will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons first.

The total cost of 5 crayons is:
5 crayons × $2 per crayon = $10

Now, we subtract the total cost from the money Violetta has:
$20 - $10 = $10

So, the change Violetta will get is:
$10

"A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. First, I add the cost of the pencil and the eraser to find the cost of one pen:

\[1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50\]

So, one pen costs $1.50. Now, to find the cost of 8 pens, I multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[1.50 \times 8 = 12.00\]

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many pounds of carrots each restaurant will get. The question says each restaurant gets 2 pounds. There are 40 restaurants, so we multiply 40 by 2:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

This means 80 pounds of carrots will be given to the restaurants. Now, we started with 200 pounds of carrots. To find out how many pounds will not be used, we subtract the 80 pounds that will be used from the 200 pounds we started with:

\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"In the city of Soda, there are 23,786 people in total. Out of these, 8,417 are men and 9,092 are women. To find out how many children there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total number of people.

So, we do the math:

23,786 (total people) - 8,417 (men) - 9,092 (women) = 6,277 (children)

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6,277."
"Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she got 3 times that, so she got 3 * 20 = 60 cards. In the second month, she got 20 fewer than the first month, so she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she got twice the total of the first and second months, so she got 2 * (60 + 40) = 200 cards. Adding them all up, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards now.

The total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is 320."
"Mark edits 500 sentences for Publisher A and 500 sentences for Publisher B. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he earns 500 * 5 = 2500 cents. Publisher B pays twice as much, so he earns 10 cents per sentence. For 500 sentences, he earns 500 * 10 = 5000 cents. Adding both, he earns 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents in a week.

The answer is 7500 cents."
"Baldur gets water from a well. Every morning, he gets 5 pails of water, and in the afternoon, he gets 6 pails. Each pail has 5 liters of water. To find out how many liters of water he gets every day, we need to add the pails he gets in the morning and afternoon, and then multiply by the amount of water in each pail.

So, in the morning, he gets 5 pails, and in the afternoon, he gets 6 pails. That's a total of 5 + 6 = 11 pails. Since each pail has 5 liters, we multiply 11 pails by 5 liters per pail:

11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"John got a one-time reward of $5000 and a raise of 5% on his salary. He makes $2000 every week. With the raise, he now makes $2100 each week.

Adding the one-time reward, his total earnings for the year are $109,200 plus $5000, which equals $114,200.

So, the total money John made that year is $114,200."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Josie has 10 acres of land. Each acre gives her 5 tons of grapes. So, to find out how many tons of grapes she gets in total, we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we know that each ton of grapes can make 2 barrels of wine. So, to find out how many barrels of wine she can make, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the barrels of wine per ton:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, the total barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year is:

\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, let's count the red pens:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add all the pens together:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, Janet has 98 pens now."
"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know Mr. Bert gives 6 tests and Brinley wants an average of 93.
2. The total score needed for an average of 93 is \(93 \times 6 = 558\).
3. Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first five tests. Adding these up gives \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438\).
4. The lowest score among the first five tests is 71. If we remove this score, the total score becomes \(438 - 71 = 367\).
5. To find the score needed on the sixth test, we set up the equation \(367 + x = 558\).
6. Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 558 - 367 = 191\).

So, Brinley needs to score \(\boxed{191}\) on her sixth test to get an average of 93."
"Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks, and each time he rode 25 kilometers. So, for the first part, the total kilometers he rode is:
\[ 5 \times 25 \times 4 = 500 \text{ kilometers} \]

Then, he changed his routine and rode 2 times a week for 3 weeks, but this time he rode 60 kilometers each time. So, for the second part, the total kilometers he rode is:
\[ 2 \times 60 \times 3 = 360 \text{ kilometers} \]

"Joe has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and each candied apple weighs half of that, so 20g.

To find the total weight of the chocolate bars:
25 chocolate bars * 40g each = 1000g

To find the total weight of the candied apples:
80 candied apples * 20g each = 1600g

Now, add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the total weight:
1000g + 1600g = 2600g

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600g.

"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. On Tuesday, she bought three times that number, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes. To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add them up: \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. So, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

Now, the problem says that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. So, we subtract $1200 from $6000 to find the cost of twenty dozen cups.

$6000 - $1200 = $4800

This means twenty dozen cups cost $4800. Since one dozen is 12, twenty dozen cups are 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of one cup, we divide the total cost of twenty dozen cups by the number of cups.

$4800 ÷ 240 = $20

So, the cost of each cup is $20.

The answer is $20."
"Sara wants to buy a jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so 2 pairs of shoes cost $40. The total cost for the jacket and shoes is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so she earns $20 from babysitting. She also has $10 saved. So, the total money she has from babysitting and savings is $10 + $20 = $30.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we need to see how much more money she needs. She needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 ÷ $4 = 10 times.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that red chickens give 3 eggs each day and white chickens give 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say the number of red chickens is \( r \). Then the number of white chickens would be \( r + 2 \).

The total eggs from red chickens would be \( 3r \) and from white chickens would be \( 5(r + 2) \). So, the total eggs collected each day is:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Gary likes to walk around the edge of a park. The park is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. To find out how long he spends walking, we first need to figure out the total distance he walks.

The formula to find the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

So, we plug in the values:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, we plug in the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking."
"On the first day, I counted 100 customers. The next day, I counted 50 more, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers. By the third day, the total number of customers was 500. To find out how many customers I counted on the third day, I subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total. So, 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 customers.

The number of customers I counted on the third day is 250."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have two pools, and both are losing water at the same rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, if we let the current amount of water in the small pool be \( S \) gallons, then 4 minutes ago it had \( S + 16 \) gallons (since it loses 4 gallons each minute).

Similarly, if the current amount of water in the big pool is \( B \) gallons, then 4 minutes ago it had \( B + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also says that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write:
\[ B = 4S \]

Let's use these two equations to find \( S \).

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is 8 gallons.

The answer is: \(\boxed{8}\)"
"Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes that cost $320.00 and a belt that costs $32.00. The total cost is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00. Her job pays her $8.00 for each hour she works. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours. So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt. The answer is 44 hours."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an extra 10%. So, the extra amount is $2000 times 10%, which is $200. So, the total amount she promised to return is $2000 plus $200, which equals $2200.

She is going to pay $165 every month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay is $165 times 12, which equals $1980.

To find out her remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return. So, $2200 minus $1980 equals $220.

Therefore, the remaining balance is $220.

The answer is: $220."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so we add 7 to the 4 roses to find the number of dahlias: 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. 

To find the total number of flowers, we add the roses and dahlias together: 4 + 11 = 15 flowers. 

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Harriet is 21 years old, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old. In three years, Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old, Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old, and Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old. To find the average age, we add their ages together and divide by 3:

\[
\frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is 45."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Naomi scored 68 points.

Next, Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 34, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we add up the points Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored:
68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 197 points.

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total:
251 - 197 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points."
"Carmen spends 10 minutes on one crossword puzzle and 5 minutes on one sudoku puzzle. She solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

For the crossword puzzles:
- 10 minutes per puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

So, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games."
"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The tank starts with 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters, so we subtract:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. She then collects rainwater which is twice the amount left, so:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. Adding the rainwater to the water left in the tank:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:
\[
\boxed{90}

"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias he plants is 90 - 40 = 50. To find the total number of flowers, we add the geraniums and petunias together: 90 + 50 = 140. So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is $5000. So, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $15000 + $5000 = $20000.

The total amount spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"Carlos and Benji are at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour. Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.

First, let's find out how much Carlos pays:
- Carlos pays $30 for each hour.
- He uses the canoe for 3 hours.
- So, Carlos pays $30 * 3 = $90.

Next, let's find out how much Benji pays:
- Benji pays $18 for each hour.
- He uses the raft for 5 hours.
- So, Benji pays $18 * 5 = $90.

Now, let's add the amounts they both pay:
- Carlos pays $90.
- Benji pays $90.
- So, together they pay $90 + $90 = $180.

The total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is $180."
"To travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus, it takes 6 days. 

To travel from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it takes half the time, which is 3 days.

The answer is 9 days."
"James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. If he loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 more grass type cards, we need to find out the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.

First, let's see how many cards he has after the changes:
- Fire type: 30 (no change)
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Now, let's add up all the cards:
30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards in total.

To find the chance of picking a water type card, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
(32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounding 33.33 to the nearest whole number, we get 33.

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Chad ordered a burrito. The base burrito costs $6.50. He added extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, which is $0.50. He also upgraded his meal for $3.00. So, the total cost is:

\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card for $5.00, so he subtracts that from the total:

So, Chad still owes \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"Kalinda and her mom are working on a 360-piece puzzle. Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take them to finish the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate: 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, we calculate 30% of 120:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   This means 36 watermelons are ready, so the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, we calculate 3/4 of 84:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   This means 63 watermelons are ready, so the remaining watermelons are:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much Mark spends on the cars. He buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, we multiply 12 by $20,000:
   \[
   12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]
   So, he spends $240,000 on the cars.

2. Next, he has to pay 10% tax on the cars. To find out the tax, we take 10% of $240,000:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000
   \]
   So, the tax is $24,000.

3. He also has to pay $1,000 for registration on each car. Since he has 12 cars, we multiply 12 by $1,000:
   \[
   12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]
   So, the registration cost is $12,000.

4. Now, we add up all these costs to find out the total amount he has to pay:
   \[
   240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

So, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:
\[
\boxed{276000}

"Kylie and Robert went to the beach to collect shells. On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, she collected 25 * 2 = 50 shells on Tuesday.

The number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is 50."
"Okay, so I heard there were 50 ants in the garden. The person said there were half as many bugs as ants. So, if there are 50 ants, then the number of bugs would be half of that, which is 25. To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and bugs together. That would be 50 ants plus 25 bugs, which equals 75 insects in total.

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"There are 36 penguins sunbathing. One-third of them, which is 12, jump into the ocean. Another one-third, also 12, go into the cave. So, the penguins left sunbathing are 36 minus 12 minus 12, which equals 12.

"Jessa is 20 years old. Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old. To find the sum of their ages, we add them together: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68. 

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we find out how many students went out through exit A. Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we calculate:
   \[
   300 = 0.30 \times 1000
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. Next, we need to find out how many students are left after those who went out through exit A:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students are left.

3. Then, we find out how many of these remaining students went out through exit B. Since \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate:
   \[
   420 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. Finally, we find out how many students went out through exit C. This is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]
   So, 280 students went out through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know that John has 54 candies and he has twice as many as Robert. So, if Robert has \( R \) candies, then:
\[ 2R = 54 \]
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]
So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, if Robert has 27 candies, then:
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]
James has 33 candies.

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. John has 54 candies and James has 33 candies, so:
\[ 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James.

The answer is: \boxed{21}"

"Mike had 5 pen pals but stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with 3 people. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, Mike gets \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters, which means 6 \(\times\) 5 = 30 pages from his pen pals. Mike also sends 6 letters, which means another 6 \(\times\) 5 = 30 pages. So, in total, Mike writes 30 + 30 = 60 pages a week. Since Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, he spends 60 \(\times\) 6 = 360 minutes writing. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 360 minutes is 360 / 60 = 6 hours. 

The final answer is:

He also talked to other people for 300 extra minutes. So, he used 450 plus 300, which is 750 minutes. His plan is 1000 minutes, so he has 1000 minus 750 left. That leaves him with 250 minutes."
"Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. Now Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries. Ginger gave Griffin some fries, let's say she gave him x fries. So Griffin had 9 + x fries. Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had 9 + x - 2 = 7 + x fries. We know Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so 7 + x = 27. Solving for x, we get x = 27 - 7 = 20. So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The answer is: 20"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another. The difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28. This difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). According to the problem, 28 is twice the total number of fish, so we can write:

\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ F = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{7}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
2. It takes 6 hours each day.
3. So, the daily cost is $250 * 6 = $1500.
4. She needs to do it 4 times a week.
5. So, the weekly cost is $1500 * 4 = $6000.
6. The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
7. So, the total cost before discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000.
8. She gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
9. The discount amount is 10% of $30000, which is $3000.
10. So, the total cost after discount is $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

The final amount Jean paid is \(\boxed{27000}\)."

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many pounds of onions the chef bought. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag is 50 pounds. So, we multiply 4 by 50:

\[ 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 200 pounds of onions cost. The price is $1.50 per pound. So, we multiply 200 by $1.50:

\[ 200 \times 1.50 = 300 \]

So, the chef spent $300 on the onions.

The final answer is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies, so Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 13 cookies, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies. 

In total, Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies. Her sister ate \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies. 

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, Sue's sister ate \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories. Sue ate \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories. 

The difference in calories is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\).

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes, so there are 60 students in total. The school has 50% boys and 50% girls, which means there are 30 boys and 30 girls.

The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since there are 30 girls in total, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

Each class has 20 students, and if there are 3 girls in the third class, then the number of boys in the third class is 20 - 3 = 17 boys.

"Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we need to calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30 \times 0.30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 9 times less than Mitchel. Therefore, Anne went down the slide:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

So, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Now, each stall originally had 20 cows, and now it gets 2 more cows. So, each stall now has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

We need to find out how many cows are in 8 of these stalls. Since each stall now has 22 cows, the total number of cows in 8 stalls is:
\[ 8 \times 22 = 176 \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"Brady has different types of coins and bills in his piggy bank. Let's count how much money he has in total.

1. He has 100 pennies. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, that's $1.
2. He has 40 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so 40 nickels are worth 40 * 5 = 200 cents. 200 cents make 2 dollars, so that's $2.
3. He has 20 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * 10 = 200 cents. 200 cents make 2 dollars, so that's $2.
4. He has 40 dollar bills. Each dollar bill is worth 1 dollar, so 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * 1 = 40 dollars.

Now, let's add it all up:
$1 (from pennies) + $2 (from nickels) + $2 (from dimes) + $40 (from dollar bills) = $45.

So, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is: $45."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many 10-foot sections are in the 200-foot tall redwood. We do this by dividing 200 by 10:
\[ 200 \div 10 = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, so to find the total weight of the redwood, we multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section:
\[ 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, the termites ate 30% of the redwood. This means 70% of the redwood is left. To find out how much the remaining redwood weighs, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:
\[ 8000 \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

She also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 because at least one book is over a week late. So, the total she has to pay is $4.00 plus $2.00, which equals $6.00.

The total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00."
"Andrea has 52 apples. She has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

Now, let's count the fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits is 76 + 92 = 168.

"To figure out how much flour Carla needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many cookies Carla is making in total. She is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow. So, we add these together:

36 + 30 = 66 cookies

Next, we need to know how much flour is needed for these 66 cookies. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies. So, we need to find out how many sets of 12 cookies are in 66 cookies:

66 ÷ 12 = 5.5

This means Carla needs enough flour for 5.5 sets of 12 cookies. Since each set of 12 cookies needs 2 cups of flour, we multiply 5.5 by 2:

5.5 × 2 = 11 cups

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake all the cookies. The answer is 11 cups."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pennies are in two thirds of the cup. The cup has 9,300 pennies. To find two thirds, we can do this:

1. Divide 9,300 by 3 to get one third: \(9,300 \div 3 = 3,100\).
2. Then, multiply 3,100 by 2 to get two thirds: \(3,100 \times 2 = 6,200\).

So, the stack has 6,200 pennies.

Next, we need to convert these pennies to dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6,200 by 100:

\(6,200 \div 100 = 62\).

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \(62\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{62}\)."

"Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half as many trees as Chris, so Ferdinand has 3 trees. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, which means Harry has \(2 \times 3 + 5 = 11\) trees. To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has: \(11 - 3 = 8\).

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The answer is 8."
"Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has $125 + $50 = $175. To find out how much all three girls have combined, we add up their amounts: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400. So, the total amount of money they have combined is $400."
"The total price of the house is $409,500. Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. So, the house is $9,500 more than her budget.

Answer: $9,500"
"Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and also paid off a part of his loan. The transfer fees were 3% of the selling price, which is $12,000. The brokerage fee was 5% of the selling price, which is $20,000. He also paid $250,000 to clear the remaining loan on the house. 

To find out how much Mr. Tan got from selling the house, we need to subtract all these amounts from the selling price.

First, we add up the fees:
$12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fee) = $32,000

Now, we subtract the total fees and the remaining loan from the selling price:
$400,000 (selling price) - $32,000 (fees) - $250,000 (remaining loan) = $118,000

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $118,000.

The correct answer is: $118,000."
"To figure out the total time, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than 20 minutes.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes (because 40% is the same as 0.40, and 0.40 times 20 is 8).
   - So, the time to heat to 400 degrees is 20 minutes plus 8 minutes, which is 28 minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - It takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat to 400 degrees.
   - So, the cooking time is 28 minutes minus 5 minutes, which is 23 minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Add up all the times: 20 minutes (heating to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (heating to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 71 minutes.

So, the total time is 71 minutes."
"The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 newspaper ads and 15 television ads. To find out how much he spent in total, we need to do some math.

For the newspaper ads:
- He bought 50 ads at $5 each.
- So, \(50 \times 5 = 250\) dollars.

For the television ads:
- He bought 15 ads at $75 each.
- So, \(15 \times 75 = 1125\) dollars.

Now, we add the two amounts together:
- \(250 + 1125 = 1375\) dollars.

So, the real estate agent spent a total of \(\boxed{1375}\) dollars on all the ads."
"The juggler has 16 balls in total. Half of them are golf balls, so that means there are 8 golf balls. Half of these golf balls are blue, which means there are 4 blue golf balls.

So, the answer is 4."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First bag has 300 M&Ms.
Second bag has 12 more than the first, so that's 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
Third bag has half of what the first bag has, so that's 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Now, let's add them all up:
300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

The answer is: 762."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, John has 2 houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of windows in the bedrooms is \(3 \times 2 = 6\). Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Next, each house has 4 additional windows that are not in the bedrooms. So, for 2 houses, the total number of these additional windows is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Now, to find the total number of windows, we add the bedroom windows and the additional windows together. So, \(12 + 8 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Sure, let's figure out the change the mother gets back.

First, we add up the cost of the items she bought:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Adding these together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The mother paid with $20. To find out the change, we subtract the total cost from what she paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change the cashier gives back is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

The collar takes a tenth of that, so:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches} \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches} \]

Now, let's add up the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches} \]

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches, so the stitches for the sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total sleeve stitches by 2:
\[ \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches per sleeve} \]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"Sure, let's figure out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on the seeds.

First, we calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet costs $40.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds is 20 * $40 = $800.

Next, we calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet costs $30.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds is 80 * $30 = $2400.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- So, the total amount spent is $800 + $2400 = $3200.

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[
\boxed{3200}
\]"
"Sean has to memorize lines for his solo song, the first scene, and the second scene. The solo song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice as many lines as the solo song, so it has 108 lines. But only a third of those are Sean's, so he has to memorize 36 lines from the first scene. The second scene has 6 more lines than the solo song, making it 60 lines. Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 48 lines from the second scene. Adding it all up, Sean has to memorize 54 lines from the song, 36 lines from the first scene, and 48 lines from the second scene. That's a total of 54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines.

The final answer is 138 lines."
"Carly started with 80 cards. First, she had 2/5 of the cards with the letter A. That means:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]
So, she had 32 cards with the letter A. This leaves:
\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]
Next, half of the remaining cards had the letter B:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]
So, 24 cards had the letter B. This leaves:
\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]
Then, 5/8 of the rest had the letter C:
\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]
So, 15 cards had the letter C. This leaves:
\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]
Therefore, the number of cards with the letter D is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Matthew takes 3 minutes for each small hole and 10 minutes for each large hole. For 30 small holes, it will take him 30 times 3 minutes, which is 90 minutes. For 15 large holes, it will take him 15 times 10 minutes, which is 150 minutes. Adding these together, he will spend 90 minutes plus 150 minutes, which equals 240 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 240 minutes is 240 divided by 60, which is 4 hours.

So, the answer is 4 hours."
"In 10 years, Mico and Marco will be older by 10 years each. So, the total increase in their ages will be 10 + 10 = 20 years. Since their current total age is 20, in 10 years, their total age will be 20 + 20 = 30.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 30."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

First, we know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if we say Sam is \( S \) years old, then Ruby is \( 6S \) years old.

Next, in 9 years, Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \) years old and Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation. First, we expand the right side:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Next, we subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Then, we subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each and 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. To find out how much he paid in total, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's calculate the cost of the popsicles:
20 popsicles × $0.25 = $5.00

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:
4 ice cream bars × $0.50 = $2.00

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know a cobra has 70 spots. A mamba has half as many spots as a cobra, so a mamba has:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we need to find out how many spots all the cobras have together. There are 40 cobras, and each has 70 spots, so:
\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find out how many spots all the mambas have together. There are 60 mambas, and each has 35 spots, so:
\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

To find the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas, we add the spots together:
\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this total number of spots:
\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many people are at the soccer game. There are 12 team members, and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 times 2, which is 24 guests. Adding the 3 coaches, we get 12 team members + 24 guests + 3 coaches = 39 people.

Next, we need to find out how many pizzas are needed. Each pizza serves 3 people, so we divide the total number of people by 3. That's 39 divided by 3, which is 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost per pizza. That's 13 times $15, which is $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195."
"Katerina makes jewelry with topaz gemstones. Each necklace uses 8 topaz gemstones, and each gemstone is 1 inch long. So, the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches. The total length of each necklace is 25 inches. To find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads, we subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace:

25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many beads fit into the 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:

17 ÷ 1/4 = 17 × 4 = 68

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

Answer: 68"
"Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote stories. In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60. In the second week, they doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week. So, Alani wrote 40 more, Braylen wrote 80 more, and Margot wrote 120 more.

Now, let's add them up:
- Alani: 20 + 40 = 60
- Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120
- Margot: 60 + 120 = 180

Adding all these together:
60 + 120 + 180 = 360

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."

So, the answer is 90 cents."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the flag has 76 stars in total. It has 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars. Let's count the stars in these rows:

- For the 3 rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
- For the 2 rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.

Now, add these together to find out how many stars are in these rows:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

So, there are 36 stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars. To find out how many stars are left for the 5-star rows, we subtract the 36 stars from the total 76 stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Now, we need to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are. We do this by dividing the remaining stars by 5:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To figure out how many trucks are needed, let's break it down step by step.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and we have 80 flagstones. So, we need to find out the total weight of these flagstones. We do this by multiplying the number of flagstones by the weight of each one:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks we need, we divide the total weight by the weight each truck can carry:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, we need 3 trucks to carry all the flagstones in one trip.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\)"
"The car in the fast lane is going 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is going half that speed, so it's going 30 miles per hour. If the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we need to find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance.

To find the time, we use the formula: time = distance ÷ speed.

For the slow lane car:
- Distance = 480 miles
- Speed = 30 miles per hour

So, the time it took is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

The answer is 16 hours."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets and each packet has 5 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to see how many chocolate bars the adults get. There are 4 adults and each gets 6 chocolate bars, so:

\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share these 16 chocolate bars equally among them. So, we divide the 16 chocolate bars by 8 children:

\[ 16 \div 8 = 2 \]

So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

The answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a break for half an hour. So, she works for 2.5 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes. She earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work. So, in 150 minutes, she works in 150 / 10 = 15 intervals. Therefore, she earns 15 * $5 = $75. 

The answer is $75."
"Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points. Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points. Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points. Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's add up all the points:
Mike: 22 points
Jim: 18 points
Tony: 43 points

The total points are 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.

So, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is 83."

The total for squats is 50 + 40 = 90.
The total for dumbbell presses is 20 + 40 = 60.

Adding all these together, we get 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"Each person in the household eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal. There are 5 people eating rice at both lunch and dinner, so that's 10 meals of rice per day (5 people * 2 meals). 

Each day, the household eats 10 * 0.2 kg = 2 kg of rice. 

In a week, the household eats 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg of rice.

We have a 42 kg bag of rice. To find out how many weeks it will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks."

Let's add up the crates he sold:
- Weekend: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

So, the total is:
20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

"John pays for a driving service to get to work. His work is 30 miles away, so he drives 60 miles each day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back). He works 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, so he drives 300 miles a week (60 miles/day * 5 days/week). Over 50 weeks, he drives 15000 miles (300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year).

He is charged $2 per mile, so for 15000 miles, he pays $30000 (15000 miles * $2/mile).

Additionally, he gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he gives $1800 in bonuses (12 months/year * $150/month).

"Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells for $20. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. We need to find out how much money she earned in the second year.

First, let's figure out how many books she sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year, and she sold 45 books this year, she sold:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books in the first year} \]

Next, we need to find out how many books she sold in total. Since there are 50 unsold books, the total number of books sold is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books} \]

Now, we can find out how many books she sold in the second year by subtracting the books sold in the first and third years from the total books sold:
\[ 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \text{ books in the second year} \]

Since each book sells for $20, the money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

So, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"

So, the answer is $3200."
"John arm wrestled 20 people and beat 80% of them. That means he beat 16 people because 20 times 0.80 is 16. So, the number of people he lost to is 20 minus 16, which is 4. 

So, the answer is 4."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, two-thirds of these loaves are sold. So, we calculate two-thirds of 60:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning. So, the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally. So, we calculate half of 20:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon.

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \]
If you buy 2 tubs, the savings will be:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

Next, we look at the milk. Each packet of milk is discounted by $0.5. If you buy 4 packets, the savings will be:
\[ 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \]

So, you will save $6 if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

The final answer is: $6."
"After drinking the Lots-of-Limbs Serum, a person will grow new limbs over time. The serum makes them grow an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days. 

In 15 days:
- For arms: 15 ÷ 3 = 5 extra arms
- For legs: 15 ÷ 5 = 3 extra legs

So, the total number of new limbs grown in 15 days is:
5 (arms) + 3 (legs) = 8 new limbs

The correct answer is 8."
"Theo has $6000 for his trip to South Africa. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 * $100 = $600. He also buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's 3 * $50 = $150. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a suit costs $100, 5 times that is 5 * $100 = $500. So the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200. 

Now, let's add up all the costs: $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $2050. Theo wants to save $2000, so he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 to spend. Subtracting the total costs from the money he has to spend, we get $4000 - $2050 = $1950. 

So, Theo has to spend $1950 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa. The answer is \boxed{1950}."
"In a family of 5, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day, and the other 2 people eat 2 eggs each day. To find out how many eggs the family eats in a week, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how many eggs the 3 people eat each day:
3 people * 3 eggs/person = 9 eggs

Next, let's find out how many eggs the other 2 people eat each day:
2 people * 2 eggs/person = 4 eggs

Now, let's add these together to find out how many eggs the whole family eats each day:
9 eggs + 4 eggs = 13 eggs

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:
13 eggs/day * 7 days = 91 eggs

So, the family eats 91 eggs in a week."
"Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 27 years old. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 32 years old.

Answer: 32"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Cera is currently 46 years old.
2. Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
3. Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.
4. Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.
5. The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time, so the population was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
6. The current population of Chile is twice the population six years ago, so the population is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We know the football team has 105 members in total. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's \( \frac{D}{2} \).

Now, if we add all these players together, we get the total number of players on the team:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's multiply everything by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Now, we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \)."
"Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2 times 6 equals 12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 times 4 equals 12 people. So, the total number of people invited is 12 plus 12, which is 24 people.

But 8 people couldn't come because they were sick, and 1/4 of those 8 people, which is 2, had other plans. So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 plus 2, which is 10 people.

To find out how many people came to the party, we subtract the 10 people who couldn't come from the 24 people who were invited. So, 24 minus 10 equals 14 people.

The number of people who showed up for Martha's party is 14."
"Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. The store already had 50 marbles. His father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 marbles. So, the total number of marbles Solomon has is 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 marbles. Each marble weighs 2 kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kgs."
"To figure out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to first find out how much water the pool can hold. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it costs $0.10 per cubic foot to fill the pool. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ 120 \times 0.10 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 30 boys in the classroom.

The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, so:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
So, there are 90 girls.

The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, so:
\[ \frac{30}{10} = 3 \]
So, there are 3 nongendered children.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[ 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Okay, so we know the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. If we have 45 wires, we need to find out how many poles we need.

Since the ratio is 1:3, we can set up a simple division to find the number of poles. We divide the number of wires by 3 to get the number of poles.

So, \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the start, there were 25 men and 15 women, making 40 people in total. After an hour, 10 people left because 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, 30 people stayed. If 22 men stayed, then the number of women who stayed would be 30 minus 22, which is 8.

So, the number of women left is 8.

**8**"
"The book costs $4, and the magazine costs half of that, so the magazine costs $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $1. 

The cost of the pen is $1."
"Jam has 26 pencils in total. She has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. If we take away the 2 loose pencils, we have 24 pencils in the boxes. Since there are 3 boxes, each box must have 8 pencils (24 divided by 3).

Meg has 46 pencils. To find out how many pencils they have together, we add Jam's and Meg's pencils: 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.

Now, to store all 72 pencils, and since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide 72 by 8. That gives us 9 boxes.

So, the answer is 9 boxes."
"Shannon makes iced coffee by adding ice cubes and cream. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. She wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees and adds 15 milliliters of cream.

First, we need to find out how many ice cubes she needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]
So, she needs 5 ice cubes.

Next, we calculate how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make it:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Then, we add the weakening effect of the cream, which is 15 milliliters. So, the total weakening is:
\[ 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters} \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. If someone gets 1 new record, they need to give 2 old records. So, if 5 people got 7 new records, they must have given away 14 old records. That's because for each new record, they give 2 old ones. So, 7 new records mean 7 times 2 old records, which is 14 old records.

The answer is 14."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the company has 100 people working there. Out of these, 2/5 are junior programmers. So, we calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

This means there are 40 junior programmers. The rest are senior programmers, so:

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Each junior programmer gets $2000 per month. So, the total payment to all junior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

Senior programmers get $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer gets:

\[
2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
\]

The total payment to all senior programmers is:

\[
\text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

Adding these together gives the total payment to all programmers:

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
\]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

\[
\boxed{224000}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. Some people got on the bus at the start.
2. At the first stop, 5 more people got on.
3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on.
4. In the end, there were 20 people on the bus.

Let's say the number of people who got on at the start is \( x \).

- After the first stop, the number of people on the bus is \( x + 5 \).
- At the second stop, 7 people got off, so the number of people became \( x + 5 - 7 \).
- Then, 8 more people got on, so the number of people became \( x + 5 - 7 + 8 \).

This simplifies to \( x + 6 \).

We know that at the end, there were 20 people on the bus, so:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left. He gives 14 to his friends, so he has 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops left. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops. Adding these to the 8 he has left, he now has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops left. He eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops left.

The final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31."
"To fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, it needs 40 more percentage points. The phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, for 40 percentage points, it will take:

\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes to hours:

\[ 120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone."
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mom gives her 10 more, so she has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops. Then, she gives 3 lollipops to Ella, so she has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.

**Final Answer: 14**"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, the customer spent $80 last time, and for every $20 spent, they get $1 off the next purchase. So, for $80 spent, they get:

\[ \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars off} \]

On this trip, they spent $43 and used the $4 reward. But they also used a coupon that took twice the reward amount off the price. So, the coupon took:

\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off} \]

The total amount deducted is:

\[ 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount they paid is:

\[ 43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

The customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and there's a 20% tax. Job B pays $42,000 a year, but there's a $6,000 property tax and a 10% tax on the remaining pay.

For Job A:
- Annual pay: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. So, we calculate 40 percent of 220:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. The problem says that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. So, we take half of 88:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the answer is 44."

"If they share the guns equally, each person would get 7 guns. So, the answer is 7."
"Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers and 70 ounces for each batch of fudge. To find out how much sugar he needs for 8 batches of suckers, we multiply 30 by 8, which gives us 240 ounces. For 1 batch of fudge, he needs 70 ounces. Adding these together, 240 plus 70 equals 310 ounces. So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total."
"Maria bought 8 shares at $8 each. So, the total cost was 8 * $8 = $64.

In the first year, the price went up by 50%. So, the new price per share was $8 + (50% of $8) = $8 + $4 = $12.

In the second year, the price went down by 25%. So, the new price per share was $12 - (25% of $12) = $12 - $3 = $9.

Now, the total value of her shares is 8 * $9 = $72.

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is $72."
"Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so Thomas ate 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, which is 3 hot dogs. To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate. So, 3 minus 2 equals 1. 

Answer: John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We have 200 students in total and they are divided into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two larger groups has \( x \) students. Then the smallest group would have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups, which is \( x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \).

Now, let's solve this:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]
\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group has \( 70 - 10 = 60 \) students.

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and they are either chickens or cows. We know he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's say the number of cows is \( C \). Then the number of chickens would be \( 2C \).

Since the total number of animals is 60, we can write:
\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, the number of cows is 20. Since the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, we have:
\[ 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts juggling 3 balls and adds 1 more ball each week. After 4 weeks, he will be juggling:

During the performance, he drops 3 balls. Out of these, 2 are caught and 1 is lost. So, the number of balls he has left is:

7 (initial balls) - 3 (dropped balls) = 4 balls

So, Josh starts juggling with 4 balls on stage.

Answer: 4"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container weighs 20 pounds.

Now, let's add all these weights together:
- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight is 260 pounds."
"Laurel got 24 baby outfits from her friend. At her baby shower, she got twice that amount, which is 48 outfits. Her mom gave her 15 more outfits. So, let's add them up:

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits in total."
"Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more. So, we first find 1/5 of 5000 meters:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we add this to the original 5000 meters:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

June has 30 days, so we multiply the new daily distance by 30:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters."
"Juice Box A costs 4 dollars. Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 5 = 9 dollars. Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it costs 4 + 7 = 11 dollars. To find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C: 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

The correct answer is: 2 dollars."
"Sure, let's figure out the total number of legs for the tables in the restaurant.

First, we have 40 tables with 4 legs each. So, we calculate:
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we have 50 tables with 3 legs each. So, we calculate:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \text{ legs} \]

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag has 36 cookies. Her son takes 4 cookies for his lunch 5 days a week, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies. So, the total number of cookies eaten by her son and husband is 20 + 7 = 27 cookies. That means Jenny eats the rest, which is 36 - 27 = 9 cookies.

Jenny eats 9 cookies."
"Davos bought 2 shirts that cost $30 each. With a 40% discount, the price of one shirt is reduced by $12 (since 40% of $30 is $12). So, one shirt now costs $18. For 2 shirts, the total cost is $36. 

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money the factory made selling tractors. They sold 10 tractors a day at $100 each.
\[ 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money they make selling silos. They sell 5 silos a day at $220 each.
\[ 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money they are making now compared to before. We do this by subtracting the old revenue from the new revenue.
\[ 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making, we divide the difference by the original amount and then multiply by 100.
\[ \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"Sure, let's figure out how much Madeline spends on her dog each year.

First, we need to know how much she spends each month. 

- Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost for food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add these up to get the total monthly cost:
- Total monthly cost = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
- Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost:
- Annual cost = $220 \times 12 = $2640

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2640}
\]"
"Sure, let's figure out how many hours Peyton's after-work activities will take.

On Monday, Peyton has a yoga class that lasts 1 hour.
On Tuesday, the cooking class is three times as long as the yoga class, so that's 3 hours.
On Wednesday, there's a cheese-tasting event that lasts 0.5 hours (which is 30 minutes).
On Thursday, the museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class, so that's 1.5 hours.
On Friday, Peyton does two hours of errands.

Now, let's add them up:
1 (Monday) + 3 (Tuesday) + 0.5 (Wednesday) + 1.5 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 8 hours

So, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is 8 hours.

The answer is: 8"
"April is donating plant pots to a local school for their new garden. The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses. So, for the roses, they need:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]
Adding the pots for daisies and roses:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]
April bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total needed from what she bought:
\[ 100 - 90 = 10 \]
So, April has 10 plant pots left over."
"Andrea had $36 at the start. She spent $11 on a sweater and gave her brother $4. To find out how much she saved, we need to subtract the money she spent and gave away from the total she had.

First, subtract the sweater:

Then, subtract the money given to her brother:
\[ 25 - 4 = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21. The correct answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"John did a few activities on his vacation. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time for boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = 9 hours. He also watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 hours. The total time for boating, swimming, and watching shows is 9 + 6 = 15 hours. This 15 hours is 30% of his total vacation time. To find the total time, we can set up the equation: 0.30 * Total Time = 15. Solving for Total Time, we get Total Time = 15 / 0.30 = 50 hours. John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so the time spent sightseeing is 0.40 * 50 = 20 hours. 

The time John spent sightseeing is 20 hours."
"Annabelle wants to buy a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 saved. From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and worked 20 hours, so she earned \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars. From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and worked 15 hours, so she earned \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars. Adding her savings and the money from both jobs, she has \(80 + 200 + 75 = 355\) dollars. The phone costs $400, so she still needs \(400 - 355 = 45\) dollars.

The answer is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"The shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest, so it is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. The combined height of the shortest and second tree is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. The tallest tree is twice this combined height, so it is 2 × 17 = 34 feet tall.

The height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"Dean's mom gave him $28 to go to the toy store. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each and 5 teddy bears at $1 each. The total cost for the toy cars is 6 times $2, which is $12. The total cost for the teddy bears is 5 times $1, which is $5. Adding these together, the total cost is $12 plus $5, which equals $17. Dean spent $17, so he has $28 minus $17 left, which is $11. His mom then gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 plus $10, which equals $21. 

So, the final amount of money Dean has left is $21."
"Morgan has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends can play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. A round of mini-golf costs $5, and the go-karts cost $10 per ride. So, for one person, the cost is $5 for mini-golf plus $20 for two rides on the go-karts, which is $25. Morgan also wants to have $5 in arcade tokens. So, the total cost for Morgan herself is $25 for mini-golf and go-karts plus $5 for arcade tokens, which is $30. 

Now, we subtract the $30 Morgan needs for herself from her total budget of $90. This leaves her with $60. Since each friend also needs $25 for mini-golf and go-karts, we divide the remaining $60 by $25 to find out how many friends she can invite. 

$60 divided by $25 is 2.4, but since she can't invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

So, the answer is 2."
"Marisa gets $5 every day. She spends 4 lollipops at 25 cents each, which is 1 dollar. So, she saves $5 - $1 = $4 each day. Over 5 days, she saves $4 \times 5 = $20. 

So, the answer is $20."
"Billy has $10 to spend on candy. The candy costs $1.5 per pound. After buying candy, he spends half of his change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. He bought 40 gumballs.

First, let's figure out how much he spent on gumballs:
- Each gumball costs $0.05.
- He bought 40 gumballs.
- So, the total cost for gumballs is \(40 \times 0.05 = 2\) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money he had left after buying gumballs:
- He initially had $10.
- He spent $2 on gumballs.
- So, he had \(10 - 2 = 8\) dollars left.

Next, we need to find out how much money he had before buying gumballs:
- He spent half of his money on gumballs.
- So, the amount he had before buying gumballs is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

Now, let's find out how much money he spent on candy:
- He initially had $10.
- He had $4 left after buying gumballs.
- So, he spent \(10 - 4 = 6\) dollars on candy.

Finally, let's calculate how many pounds of candy he bought:
- The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
- He spent $6 on candy.
- So, the number of pounds of candy he bought is \(\frac{6}{1.5} = 4\) pounds.

The answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Carver is 45 years old, and he is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Let's figure out his son's age.

If we say his son's age is \( x \), then twice his son's age would be \( 2x \). Since Carver is 5 years less than that, we can write it as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we add 5 to both sides:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Now, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

**Answer: 25**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
2. Then it travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
3. From the third city back to the first city, it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two trips. So, the distance is \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for one full trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so the total distance traveled in a day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide 18,000 by 900:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

So, the train goes 20 days between services.

The answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much stuffing is needed for each type of dog bed:
- A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A collie bed needs the average of the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds, which is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing.

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds:
- For 4 chihuahua beds: 4 beds * 2 pounds per bed = 8 pounds.
- For 3 collie beds: 3 beds * 5 pounds per bed = 15 pounds.

Adding these together:
8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

The answer is: 23 pounds."
"John drives 210 miles to his friend's house at 70 mph, which takes 3 hours. Then he drives 240 miles back home at 80 mph, which also takes 3 hours. So, the total time for the trip is 6 hours.

"To pass to the next school year, Jane needs to score at least 42 points in total from three tests. She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. Adding these together, she has 33 points. To find out how many more points she needs, we subtract 33 from 42:

42 - 33 = 9

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. First, we know 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks.
2. Then, the number of people kicked out for shoplifting is four times that number minus 5. So, \(4 \times 3 = 12\), and then \(12 - 5 = 7\).
3. Next, the number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters. So, \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
4. Now, we add up all the people kicked out for these reasons: \(3 + 7 + 21 = 31\).
5. We know the total number of people kicked out is 50. So, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is \(50 - 31 = 19\).

So, the answer is 19."
"Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who has 8 points. So, Erin's current points are 3 times 8, which is 24. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract 14 from 24. That is, 24 - 14 = 10. 

So, the answer is 10."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for frames is \(44 \times 20 = 880\) dollars.
   - Each frame also needs to be etched, which costs an additional 20% of $20. So, the etching cost per frame is \(20 \times 0.20 = 4\) dollars.
   - The total cost per frame including etching is \(20 + 4 = 24\) dollars.
   - For 44 seniors, the total cost for etching is \(44 \times 4 = 176\) dollars.
   - So, the total cost for picture frames and etching is \(880 + 176 = 1056\) dollars.

2. **Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will get pins that cost $5 each.
   - So, the total cost for pins is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) dollars.

3. **Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so \(44 \times \frac{1}{4} = 11\) seniors are officers.
   - Each officer gets a cord that costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for cords is \(11 \times 12 = 132\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding all the costs together: \(1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198\) dollars.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is \(\boxed{1198}\) dollars."

Answer: $320"
"On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of shoes. On Saturday, they sold double that, so that's 14 times 2, which is 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold half of what they sold on Saturday, so that's 28 divided by 2, which is 14 pairs. But 6 pairs were returned, so they only sold 14 minus 6, which is 8 pairs on Sunday.

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

So, the total pairs sold is 14 plus 28 plus 8, which equals 50 pairs.

Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes sold is 50 times 2, which is 100 shoes.

The final answer is 100 shoes."
"Hallie had dance practice on different days of the week. On Tuesday, she practiced for 1 hour. On Thursday, she practiced for 2 hours. On Saturday, her practice was twice as long as on Tuesday, so that's 2 times 1 hour, which is 2 hours. 

To find out how many hours she practiced in a week, we add up all the hours:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

So, the total hours she practiced in a week is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours.

The correct answer is 5 hours."
"The company bought equipment worth $400,000. But 40% of it was faulty, so the faulty equipment is worth:

\[ 40\% \times 400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000 \]

So, the value of the functioning equipment is:

\[ 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000 \]

The total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[ \boxed{240000} \]"
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, give 2 kg of milk each day. So, for the 15 sheep giving 1 kg each, that's 15 sheep times 1 kg, which equals 15 kg. For the 15 sheep giving 2 kg each, that's 15 sheep times 2 kg, which equals 30 kg. Adding these together, 15 kg plus 30 kg equals 45 kg. So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.

**45**"
"Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls. She gave 1 roll to each of her 6 children, so she gave away 6 rolls. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. She then broke each of these 6 rolls into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces she had for the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

"There are 40 pupils in a class. Half of them like blue, so that's 40 divided by 2, which is 20 pupils. The rest are 40 minus 20, which is 20 pupils. One-fourth of these 20 pupils like green, so that's 20 divided by 4, which is 5 pupils. The rest like yellow, so that's 20 minus 5, which is 15 pupils.

The number of pupils who like yellow is 15."
"Lucy sells apples at $4 each. On Monday, she made $56 from selling apples. To find out how many apples she sold on Monday, we divide $56 by $4:

\[ \frac{56}{4} = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the amount she picked on Tuesday, which means:

\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

So, Lucy picked 24 apples on Wednesday.

To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked each day:

\[ 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs, which is 20 socks, and 15 loose socks. So, she washed a total of 20 + 15 = 35 socks. 

To find out how many socks she missed, we subtract the socks she washed from the total she had:

50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks."
"Rachel started with 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more, so she had 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. Her brother ate 44 cookies, so she has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left.

"Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate of 10%. She has to pay an equal amount every month. To find out how much she has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest. The interest rate is 10% per year, so for five months, the interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{10}{100} \times \frac{5}{12} = 3650 \times \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = 3650 \times \frac{50}{1200} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, so he hiked 14 × 8 = 112 kilometers. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours, so she hiked 9 × 5 = 45 kilometers. The difference in the distance they hiked is 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers. So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

Answer: 67 kilometers"
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the pesos they have together.

For silver pesos: Axel has 50 and Anna has 100, so together they have \(50 + 100 = 150\) silver pesos.

For gold pesos: Axel has 80 and Anna has 120, so together they have \(80 + 120 = 200\) gold pesos.

Adding the silver and gold pesos together: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Millie makes lemonade and sells it at her stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all 36 cups, she makes $36. The cost of supplies is $18, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18. She sells 4 cups per hour, so it takes her 36 ÷ 4 = 9 hours to sell all the lemonade. To find her profit per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours: $18 ÷ 9 = $2. So, Millie makes $2 profit per hour. 

The answer is: $2."
"Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 12.8 hectares represents in terms of the whole land he had.

If 12.8 hectares is 2/5 of the total land, we can set up the equation to find the total land. Let's call the total land \( x \) hectares. So, we have:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

\[
\boxed{32}

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that an eraser costs $2 and a pencil costs $3.

Now, if we want to find out how much 6 erasers cost, we multiply the cost of one eraser by 6:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]
So, 6 erasers cost $12.

Next, for 8 pencils, we multiply the cost of one pencil by 8:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
So, 8 pencils cost $24.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.

The final answer is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"David and Dasha went to a carnival with 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket is $2. So, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4. For 9 rides, Dasha would need 9 * $4 = $36. David bought a bracelet for $30 that gives him 9 rides. So, David only spent $30. 

To find out how much David saved, we subtract what Dasha spent from what David spent: $36 - $30 = $6.

So, David saved $6."
"Monica is wrapping gifts. She has 6 for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers. That's a total of 12 gifts. She has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to use it for bows on each gift. So, we need to divide 144 by 12 to find out how much ribbon she can use for each bow.

\[ 144 \div 12 = 12 \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"Betty and Sam have popsicles in a ratio of 5:6. Together, they have 165 popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to figure out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents.

The total parts in the ratio are 5 + 6 = 11. So, each part is 165 ÷ 11 = 15 popsicles.

Betty has 5 parts, which is 5 × 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts, which is 6 × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has: 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The answer is: 15."
"Tim cancels his cable subscription and gets streaming services. Netflix costs $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but with a bundle discount, he saves 20%. 

First, let's find out how much Hulu and Disney Plus cost after the discount. The normal cost for both is $10 each, so together they cost $20. With a 20% discount, he pays 80% of $20. 

\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]

So, Hulu and Disney Plus together cost $16 after the discount. Adding Netflix, which is $10, the total cost for the streaming services is:

\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \]

Tim's cable subscription cost $60 a month. By switching to the streaming services, he saves:

\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \]

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package."
"Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, which is half the time she spends recording it, so she spends 2 hours recording. She also spends 90 minutes editing, which is 1.5 hours. To find the total time, we add these up:

- Writing: 4 hours
- Recording: 2 hours
- Editing: 1.5 hours

Total time = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So,

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

The answer is 20%."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. First, we need to know how many slots there are in the shelving system. It has 6 rows and 6 columns, so we multiply 6 by 6 to get the total number of slots:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of slots. So, we first find double the number of slots:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to that number:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Erica started with 20 cards she made herself. Her dad gave her 2 boxes with 15 cards each, so that's 2 times 15, which is 30 cards. So, she had 20 plus 30, which is 50 cards in total.

She gave out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family, which is 24 plus 5, that's 29 cards. She also got 17 cards from family and friends.

So, the cards she has now is 50 minus the 29 she gave out, plus the 17 she got. That's 50 minus 29, which is 21, plus 17, which is 38.

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 to Mark. First, we need to find out how many slices that is.

For Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

For Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, Bill and Mark together get:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. So, we subtract the slices she eats and the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To buy a bike that costs $300, Mark needs to save more money. He already has $50 in his bank. So, he needs to save $300 - $50 = $250. If he earns $10 each day, he needs to work for $250 / $10 = 25 days to save enough money.

So, the answer is 25 days."
"Nancy saw 90 spiders. She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, so that's 90 divided by 3, which is 30 millipedes. The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, that's 2 times 30, which is 60, minus 12, which gives us 48 stink bugs. To find the total number of bugs, we add the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together: 90 + 30 + 48. That equals 168 bugs in total.

The total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica. If Erica is 30 years old, we can figure out the ages step by step.

First, let's find out how old Beth is. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30, we add 5 to 30:
\[ 30 + 5 = 35 \]
So, Beth is 35 years old.

Next, we need to find out how old Alice is. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and Beth is 35, we add 7 to 35:
\[ 35 + 7 = 42 \]
So, Alice is 42 years old.

Now, to find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:
\[ 42 - 30 = 12 \]

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years."

First, we need to know how many days the builder works in a month. He works 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, we multiply 6 by 4:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days he works in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply 24 by 12:
\[ 24 \times 12 = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, we know he gets paid $50 every day. So, to find out how much he earns in a year, we multiply 288 by 50:
\[ 288 \times 50 = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the builder earns \(\boxed{14400}\) dollars in a year."
"Mark is making a lot of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, he needs 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk. Flour comes in 2-cup bags, so he needs 6 bags of flour. Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he needs 2 bottles of milk. He needs 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

Answer: 4"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in a day when it's on for 8 hours. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, so for 8 hours, it uses:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is 1000 watts, we convert 7200 watts to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours, he will use it for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

So, the energy used in 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Over 30 days, the total savings is:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"Okay, let's count the stripes on the zebras:

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- Another zebra with half the stripes of the 36-striped zebra: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add them up:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 4 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[\frac{88}{4} = 22\]

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is 22."
"Tyson is making muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Each sandwich serves 4 people, and there are 20 people watching the game. So, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches (20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches).

For 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. Meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of meat will cost $35.00 (5 pounds * $7.00 per pound). Cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds of cheese will cost $15.00 (5 pounds * $3.00 per pound).

Adding the cost of meat and cheese together, Tyson will spend $50.00 ($35.00 + $15.00).

So, the answer is $50.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. Allan has 40 cannolis.
2. He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so he has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.
3. He buys 60 more cannolis, so now he has \(40 + 60 = 100\) cannolis.
4. He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, so he buys \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
5. This means he now has \(80 - 20 = 60\) corns.
6. The total number of corns and cannolis he has now is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He walked half of his steps to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also walked 1,000 steps with his friend. After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to figure out how many steps he had already taken before his jog. He had 8,000 steps taken before his jog because 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000. 

He had already taken 6,000 steps before his jog because 5,000 (to and from school) + 1,000 (with his friend) = 6,000. 

So, the steps he took during his jog are 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000.

The answer is 2,000 steps."
"Toby is reading a book that has 45 pages. On average, each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After finishing the book, it takes him 10 more minutes to get to the airport. So, the total time from the start of reading until he leaves for the airport is:
\[ 30 + 10 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport. Therefore, the number of minutes early he will be is:
\[ 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"In May, the company hired 40 employees, and each employee was paid $15 per hour for 40 hours a week. So, each employee got $15 times 40 hours, which is $600. For 40 employees, the total payment was $600 times 40, which is $24,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees left, so 1/4 times 40 is 10 employees. That means 30 employees were left. Each of these 30 employees got $600, so the total payment for June was $600 times 30, which is $18,000.

Adding the payments for May and June together, we get $24,000 plus $18,000, which equals $42,000.

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $42,000."
"Sally went to the seashore and her parents gave her $10. She bought taffy, seashells, and magnets. The taffy was on sale: buy 1 pound for $3 and get 1 pound at half price. So, for 2 pounds of taffy, she paid $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (half of $3). That's $4.50 for the taffy.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. So, 4 magnets cost $1.00 (4 times $0.25).

Adding it all up, she spent $4.50 on taffy, $1.50 on seashells, and $1.00 on magnets. That's a total of $7.00.

She started with $10, so after spending $7.00, she has $3.00 left.

The answer is: $3.00"
"Tim buys two packages of fireworks. The first package costs $400 and the second costs twice that, so it's $800. That makes $1200 before the discount. He gets a 20% discount, so he saves $240 (20% of $1200). After the discount, he pays $960 for the fireworks. He also buys a finale firework for $150. So, in total, he spends $960 + $150 = $1110.

The total amount Tim spent is $1110."
"Shannon eats 2 cookies every night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies

Her recipe makes 12 cookies in one batch. To find out how many batches she needs, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per batch:
60 cookies / 12 cookies/batch = 5 batches

Since each batch is 1 dozen, she needs to make 5 dozens of cookies.

So, the answer is: 5 dozens."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Marcy makes candles and says they are 99% guaranteed not to explode. That means 1% of the candles might explode. If she makes 50,000 candles, we need to find out how many of them might explode.

First, we calculate 1% of 50,000:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500 \]

So, 500 candles might explode. Now, we know that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. But the problem doesn't give us a specific number for how many of the exploding candles also smell like wet dog. Without that information, we can't determine exactly how many candles both smell like wet dog and will explode.

However, if we assume the defects are independent, we can estimate that 5% of the 500 candles that might explode also have the wet dog smell. So:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{5}{100} \times 500 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is estimated to be 25.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know the discount price of one blouse. The original price is $20, and it's on sale for 30% off. So, we calculate 70% of $20 because 100% - 30% = 70%.

To find 70% of $20:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]

So, each blouse costs $14 after the discount.

Now, Misha picks 4 blouses. To find the total cost, we multiply the price of one blouse by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses is $56.

The answer is: \boxed{56}"
"Joanne and her sister are picking apples from their orchard. Joanne picks 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that amount from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples. Let's say Joanne picks \(x\) apples from the average trees.

So, Joanne picks a total of:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Her sister picks twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples, and three times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples. Her sister doesn't pick any apples from the average trees.

So, her sister picks a total of:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

Together, they pick 500 apples. So, we can write the equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, Joanne picked 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We know there are 180 heads in total, and each animal (camel or dromedary) has one head. So, if we let \( c \) be the number of camels and \( d \) be the number of dromedaries, we can say:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

Next, we know there are 304 humps in total. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. So, we can write:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know there are 124 camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
So,
\[ d = 180 - 124 = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Tom went on a trip for two weeks in Europe. In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers each day. So, the total distance for the first 4 days is:
\[ 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \]

Over the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days. So, the distance for the next 2 days is:
\[ 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \]

On the next day, he didn't travel at all, so the distance for that day is:
\[ 0 \text{ km} \]

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days. So, the total distance for the second week is:
\[ 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \]

Now, we add up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip is:
\[ \boxed{3140} \]"
"Zack's locker is twice the size of Peter's locker. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, so Zack's locker is 5 times 2, which is 10 cubic inches. Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker, so we take Zack's locker size, 10 cubic inches, and multiply it by 2. That gives us 10 times 2, which is 20 cubic inches. So, Timothy's locker is 20 cubic inches."
"Oliver is at 3,000 feet and the comb is at 6,000 feet. To get to the comb, Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet. So the answer is 3,000 feet."
"Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank and twice that amount from the second bank, which is $8000. He also had $5000 of his own money. So, the total amount of money he has now is:

$4000 (from the first bank) + $8000 (from the second bank) + $5000 (his own money) = $17000

So, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is $17000."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Then, 4 boats came and each boat took away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Now, subtract the 20 cats from the initial 50 cats:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

After that, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Now, subtract the 18 cats that ran after the mouse from the 30 cats that were left:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, Bill pays $8 a month for the first 6 months. So, for 6 months, he pays:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

Next, for the next 8 months, the price goes up to $12 a month. So, for 8 months, he pays:
\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]

After that, the price increases to $14 a month. Since we need to cover 2 years and we already have 14 months, we need to cover the remaining 10 months. But we only need 8 more months to complete 2 years, so:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 48 + 96 + 112 = 256 \]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[ \boxed{256} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \]
So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
So, he saved $2 on the jogger jeans. This means the original price of the jogger jeans was:
\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the original price of the jogger jeans is $24. The difference is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Sure, let's figure out how many employees can go on the trip.

We have 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 people. So, for the buses:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ people} \]

Next, we have 6 minibusses, and each minibus can hold 30 people. So, for the minibusses:
\[ 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ people} \]

Then, we have 10 minivans, and each minivan can hold 15 people. So, for the minivans:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ people} \]

Now, we add all these together to find out the total number of people that can go on the trip:
\[ 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ 570 \]"
"Lillian made 3 bird feeders herself and bought 3 more. The ones she made attract 10 more birds than the ones she bought. So, the bought feeders attract 20 birds each, and the homemade ones attract 30 birds each.

For the bought feeders:
3 feeders * 20 birds = 60 birds

For the homemade feeders:
3 feeders * 30 birds = 90 birds

Adding them together:
60 birds + 90 birds = 150 birds

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day.

The answer is 150."
"Aleksandra went to a restaurant and ordered some soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4. The soup cost 25% more than the bagel, so we need to find out how much that is. 25% of $4 is $1, so the soup cost $4 + $1 = $5. The cake cost half the price of the bagel, so it cost $4 / 2 = $2. To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay, we add up the cost of the soup, the bagel, and the cake: $5 + $4 + $2 = $11. 

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner."
"Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He also wants to have $50 in spending cash. So, he needs $100 + $50 = $150. Each card he sells for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money by the price per card: $150 ÷ $1.5 = 100 cards. He keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3. If 2/3 of his cards equals 100, then 1/3 of his cards is 50. So, if 2/3 is 100, then 1/3 is 50, and 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Answer: 150**"
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

1. The caterer was supposed to make enough hotdogs for 36 guests.
2. He made enough for half of the guests to have 2 hotdogs each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests got 2 hotdogs each, which is 36 hotdogs.
3. The other half, also 18 guests, got 1 hotdog each, which is 18 hotdogs.
4. So, he made a total of 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

But, 40 guests showed up. The first 18 guests already had their 2 hotdogs, so they used up 36 hotdogs. The remaining 22 guests each wanted 1 more hotdog, so they needed 22 more hotdogs.
5. That means 22 guests wanted 22 more hotdogs, but there were only 54 hotdogs made. So, 54 - 22 = 32 hotdogs were left after the first 18 guests had their 2 hotdogs.
6. Since 22 guests wanted 22 more hotdogs and there were only 32 hotdogs left, 32 - 22 = 10 hotdogs were enough, but 22 - 10 = 12 guests did not get their second hotdog.

So, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 12.

The answer is: \boxed{12}"
"Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. First, we find half of Indras' name: 6 divided by 2 is 3. Then, we add 4 to 3 to find the number of letters in her sister's name: 3 plus 4 is 7. Now, we add the letters in both names: 6 plus 7 is 13. So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13.

The answer is: 13"
"Sure, let's figure out how much Charlotte's order will cost after the discount.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items she wants to buy:
- A set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
- A set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
- Five separate utensils, each costing $5.00, will be \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

So, the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Now, the store is offering a 20% discount. This means Charlotte will pay 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

So, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"Dora wants to buy a skipping rope for $6, a board game for $11, and a playground ball for $2. She has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. 

First, let's add up the cost of the items:
- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Now, let's add up the money Dora has:
- From allowance: $2
- From her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
Amount needed = $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar."
"Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Prince Arthur, with his spear, killed three quarters of what Thaddeus did. So, we take three quarters of 100:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

Prince Walter, using a rusty iron axe, killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we double 75:

\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

Prince Bruce, without his sword, killed one-fifth of what Prince Walter did. So, we take one-fifth of 150:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

So, Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 15 gallons of gas and we need to divide it equally into 5 containers. So, we do 15 divided by 5, which gives us 3 gallons per container.

Next, Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Since each container has 3 gallons, we take \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 3 gallons. That's the same as multiplying 3 by \(\frac{1}{4}\), which gives us \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons.

Now, we need to convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) by 8. That's the same as 3 times 2, which is 6 pints.

So, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline.

The answer is: 6 pints."
"George spent $5 and had 1% of his money left, which is $0.05. So, he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95. He bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each, so that's 3 * $0.40 = $1.20. After buying the chips, he spent $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75 on candy bars. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so he bought $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so he shared 20 lollipops with his friends. He has 4 friends, so each friend got 5 lollipops. The answer is 5."
"Rory made a cake that weighed 20 ounces. She cut it into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each had one piece, so that's 2 pieces in total. Each piece would weigh 2.5 ounces because 20 divided by 8 is 2.5. Since 2 pieces were eaten, that's 5 ounces (2 times 2.5). So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces (20 minus 5).

The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges. They are sharing these oranges with 6 friends, making a total of 2 + 6 = 8 people. If we divide the oranges equally among everyone, each person will get 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges. So, the answer is 7."
"Antoine is making French onion soup. The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that amount. So, he will use 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the onions will cost him 4 pounds times $2.00, which is $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is on sale for $2.00. So, the beef stock will cost him 2 boxes times $2.00, which is $4.00.

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock together, we get $8.00 plus $4.00, which equals $12.00.

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings. That is $12.00 divided by 6, which equals $2.00 per serving.

So, the cost per serving is $2.00.

The answer is: $2.00"
"Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, and Bernadette's drive takes four times as long, so that's 4 times 4, which is 16 minutes. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to account for the extra time. 

The answer is 12 minutes."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the area of Billie's bedroom is 360 square feet. The length of the room is given as 3 yards. Since 1 yard is 3 feet, the length in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
So, we have:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
To find the width, we divide 360 by 9:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack has 20 beads, so she bought:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So she bought:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \times 20 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth has more beads than Elizabeth. To find out how many more:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"When Marcus wakes up, his house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. So, in 3 hours, the temperature goes up by:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ degrees} \]
So, the temperature after baking is:
\[ 40 + 15 = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Then Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, in 30 minutes, the temperature goes down by:
\[ 30 \div 10 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ degrees} \]
So, the temperature after opening the window is:
\[ 55 - 6 = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run. That's a total of 170 minutes.

James was faster in the swim by 10%, so he took 36 minutes for the swim. He took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride, so he took 85 minutes for the bike ride.

Jon's total time was 170 minutes, and since James won by 10 minutes, James's total time was 180 minutes.

So, the time James took for the run is:
180 minutes (total) - 36 minutes (swim) - 85 minutes (bike) = 59 minutes.

The answer is 59 minutes."
"Movie C is 1.25 hours long. To find out how long it is in minutes, we multiply 1.25 by 60 because there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 1.25 times 60 is 75 minutes. 

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to 75 minutes, which gives us 80 minutes for Movie B.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. To find one-fourth of 80 minutes, we divide 80 by 4. So, 80 divided by 4 is 20 minutes.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how far the horse runs in 30 minutes. The horse runs at 32 miles per hour, so in half an hour, it runs:
\[ 32 \times 0.5 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much hay the horse eats. For every mile the horse runs, it eats half a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse eats:
\[ 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael gets is:
\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

The correct answer is: 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. So, the cost per sneaker is:
\[ \frac{576}{48} = 12 \]
Each sneaker cost $12.

On Monday, he sold 17 sneakers for $20 each. So, the money he made from these sales is:
\[ 17 \times 20 = 340 \]
He made $340 from the flash sale.

The remaining sneakers are:
\[ 48 - 17 = 31 \]
He sold these 31 sneakers to a department store for $25 each. So, the money he made from these sales is:
\[ 31 \times 25 = 775 \]
He made $775 from the department store sales.

The total money he made from all sales is:
\[ 340 + 775 = 1115 \]
He made $1115 in total.

The cost of all the sneakers was $576. So, his profit is:
\[ 1115 - 576 = 539 \]

So, the salesman's profit is:
\[ \boxed{539} \]"
"Beatrice bought ten packets of crayons. Six packets had eight crayons each, and four packets had sixteen crayons each. To find the total number of crayons, we need to do some adding up.

For the six packets with eight crayons each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

For the four packets with sixteen crayons each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \]

Now, we add these two amounts together:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons. The answer is 112."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the super ticket costs $20 and you get a popcorn with a soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is $21.

Next, we know the regular ticket costs $12. You also have to buy a popcorn and a soda separately. The soda costs $3. So, the total cost for the regular ticket plus a popcorn and a soda is $12 + the cost of the popcorn + $3.

You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means the cost of the regular ticket plus a popcorn and a soda is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket.

So, we can write it like this:
\[ 21 - (12 + \text{cost of popcorn} + 3) = 2 \]

Now, let's solve it:
\[ 21 - 15 - \text{cost of popcorn} = 2 \]
\[ 6 - \text{cost of popcorn} = 2 \]
\[ \text{cost of popcorn} = 6 - 2 \]
\[ \text{cost of popcorn} = 4 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 20 balloons cost $900. To find out how much one balloon costs, we divide $900 by 20:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \]

So, one balloon costs $45.

Two days later, the cost of each balloon increased by $20. So, the new cost for one balloon is:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we need to find out how much 170 balloons will cost at the new price. We multiply the new price by 170:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

So, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find out the car's average speed, we need to figure out the total distance it traveled and the total time it took.

First, the car drove at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours. So, the distance covered in this part of the trip is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, the car drove at 30 miles per hour for 1 hour. So, the distance covered in this part is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we add these distances to get the total distance:
\[ 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

The total time taken for the trip is:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{miles per hour} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800 and each ruby is worth $1200. 

First, we find out how many sapphires Jenna has left after the trade:
8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = 5 sapphires

Next, we calculate the value of the sapphires:
5 sapphires * $800 = $4000

Then, we calculate the value of the rubies:
2 rubies * $1200 = $2400

Finally, we add the value of the sapphires and rubies to find the total value:
$4000 + $2400 = $6400

So, the total value of all her jewels is $6400.

The correct answer is: $6400."
"Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find out how many apples they eat in 30 days, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's calculate how many apples Marin eats in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Next, let's calculate how many apples Nancy eats in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we add the apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much soil one raised bed needs. Each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one bed is:

\[ 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is:

\[ 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. So, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 15 red cards.

Next, the number of green cards is 60% more than the red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 15 = 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]
So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Now, the number of yellow cards is the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the red, green, and yellow cards together:
\[ 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78."

"Sure, let's figure this out together.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots.

First, we need to find out how many puppies in total there are:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we put in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"

"Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. 

First, let's find out how much she earns from the cans:
- She has 3 cans a week.
- Each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from cans each week.

Next, let's find out how much she earns from the bottles:
- She has 5 bottles a week.
- Each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from bottles each week.

Now, let's add the earnings from cans and bottles to find her total weekly earnings:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents.

Since we need to find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings in four weeks = \(21 \times 4 = 84\) cents.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{84}\) cents."
"Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, and Frederick has 10 plants. First, we need to find out how many plants Toni has. Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we calculate 60% of 10, which is 6. So, Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants. Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so we subtract 7 from 16. That gives us 16 - 7 = 9 plants. Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants.

The answer is 9."

So, Kelly paid \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more than Becky."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's 2 × 2 = 4 pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's 4 × 2 = 8 towels

Now, let's add them up for one room:
2 (sheets) + 1 (comforter) + 4 (pillow cases) + 8 (towels) = 15 pieces of laundry per room

There are 80 rooms, so we multiply the number of pieces per room by the number of rooms:
15 × 80 = 1200

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200.

The answer is: 1200"

First, we need to find out how many pencils there were at the start. There are 30 students and each student had 10 pencils. So, the total number of pencils is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

After two months, 1/5 of the pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

This means the number of pencils left after two months is:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left is:

"Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room. Let's figure out how many carrot sticks he needs to eat.

If we say the number of carrot sticks is \( x \), then the number of cookies he can have is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \). We know he wants 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The answer is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know the length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is half a foot. So, each remora is 0.5 feet long.

Benny saw 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark is 10 feet long. To find out what percentage 1 foot is of 10 feet, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know there are 32 kids in Gina's class. Some kids have allergies to dairy, some to peanuts, and some to both.

First, we know 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. But 3 kids are allergic to both, so we can't just add 9 and 6 because we would be counting those 3 kids twice.

So, we need to subtract the 3 kids who are allergic to both from the total of dairy and peanut allergies:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the 12 from the total number of kids in the class:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"There are 3 groups of 200 employees each, so the total number of employees is 3 times 200, which is 600. Each group has 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is 3 times 7, which is 21. Adding the employees and the tour guides together, we get 600 plus 21, which equals 621. So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the hotel costs during the busy weekend. The normal price is $1500 per day, and it's 20% more expensive. So, we calculate 20% of $1500:

\[ 1500 \times 0.20 = 300 \]

Now, we add this to the normal price to get the busy weekend price:

\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, we multiply the daily price by 3:

\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Each ticket costs $5000, and they need two tickets:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the hotel and the plane tickets to get the total cost of the trip:

\[ 5400 + 10000 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is:

\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

If he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, then to find out how many hours he runs, we divide the total miles by his speed. So, 60 miles divided by 10 miles per hour equals 6 hours. Therefore, James runs 6 hours a week.

The answer is: 6 hours."
"Uncle Ben has four horses. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats for each meal, and he feeds them twice a day. So, each horse eats 10 pounds of oats a day (5 pounds per meal times 2 meals). With four horses, they eat 40 pounds a day (10 pounds per horse times 4 horses). Over five days, they will eat 200 pounds (40 pounds per day times 5 days). Since each bag has 50 pounds of oats, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags (200 pounds divided by 50 pounds per bag).

So, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Jana has 27 puppies. Two thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians. So, to find out how many Pomeranians she has, we do:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18
\]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, one third of these Pomeranians are girls. So, to find out how many girl Pomeranians she has, we do:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

Answer: 6"
"To find the average highest temperature of the three countries, we need to add up the highest temperatures and then divide by the number of countries.

The highest temperatures are:
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

First, let's add them up:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -30

Now, we divide the sum by the number of countries, which is 3:
-30 ÷ 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -10°F."
"The toy car costs $12 and the child already has $4. So, the child needs to save:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

If the child saves $2 each day, then it will take:

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the child needs 4 days to save the remaining money."
"Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays that can each hold 24 eggs. First, we need to find out how many eggs the 2 trays can hold in total. 

2 trays * 24 eggs/tray = 48 eggs

Now, we subtract the number of eggs that can be placed on the trays from the total number of eggs Jaime has:

64 eggs - 48 eggs = 16 eggs

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.

The answer is 16."
"Sally buys a small pizza for $8. The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, so it costs:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32.

A) 32"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that each pack of razors costs $4.00 and contains 4 razors. If Heather buys 2 packs, she gets the second one free because of the ""buy one get one free"" sale. So, she only pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00.

Next, Heather has a $2.00 coupon. So, we subtract $2.00 from the $4.00 she paid. That leaves her with $2.00.

Now, she bought 2 packs, and each pack has 4 razors. So, 2 packs have 8 razors in total.

To find out how much each razor costs, we divide the total cost by the number of razors. So, $2.00 divided by 8 razors equals $0.25 per razor.

Since we need to convert this to cents, $0.25 is the same as 25 cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after the discount is 25 cents.

The answer is: \boxed{25}"
"The shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall. In a human pyramid, the shortest person is at the top. So, the height of the pyramid is 60 inches. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. 

\[ \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 5 feet."
"Charisma works 8 hours a day and takes a 5-minute walk every hour. So, each day she walks:

5 minutes/hour × 8 hours/day = 40 minutes/day

After 5 days, she walks:

40 minutes/day × 5 days = 200 minutes

So, the answer is 200 minutes."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 now, three times his age is 3 * 14 = 42. So, in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. If she will be 42 in four years, that means she is currently 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

So, Angela is currently 38 years old."
"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. Each morning ride costs $6 and each afternoon ride costs $2. To find out how much he spent, we need to calculate the total cost for both the morning and afternoon rides.

For the morning rides:
- He drives 14 mornings.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- So, the total for morning rides is \(14 \times 6 = 84\) dollars.

For the afternoon rides:
- He drives 14 afternoons.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- So, the total for afternoon rides is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the two totals together:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

So, Paul spent a total of $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"Ashley brought 5 boxes of oranges, with 10 oranges in each box. So, Ashley brought:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Together, they brought:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, we can make:
\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many guests make the two venues cost the same, we need to set up the costs for each venue and then find the point where they are equal.

For the first venue:
- There's a flat fee of $200.
- Plus, $5 for each guest.

For the second venue:
- $25 for each guest, and this includes food.

We need to find the number of guests, \( x \), where the costs are the same. So, we set up the equation:

\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Then, divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10."
"Lily, David, and Bodhi together found 43 insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, and Lily found 7 more than David. Let's figure out how many insects Lily found.

If we say David found \( D \) insects, then Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects because David found half of what Bodhi found. Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects because she found 7 more than David.

The total number of insects they found is:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, which means:
\[ 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found \(\boxed{16}\) insects."
"Mariah and her grandma were knitting. Mariah used a part of a skein, and her grandma used another part. There are 364 yards in a whole skein.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the skein, so she used:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the skein, so she used:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}

"Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. She has 2 friends who each want 5 gifts, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts. She also has 3 friends who each want 2 gifts, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts. Plus, she decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, the total number of gifts is 10 plus 6 plus 10, which equals 26.

The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."
"The chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet. So, the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.

The length of the couch is 18 feet."
"Suzie bought four packs of gum. She got two packs of strawberry and one pack each of grape and green apple. The grape gum costs $2 and the green apple gum costs half of that, which is $1. She spent a total of $7. 

Let's figure out how much each pack of strawberry gum costs. We know:
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $1
- Total spent: $7

So, the cost of the strawberry gum is:
\[ 7 - (2 + 1) = 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Since she got two packs of strawberry gum, the cost of each pack is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2."
"Frederick is making popsicle sticks from wood. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece. He has $24 to spend. A 2 x 4 piece costs $4 and a 2 x 8 piece costs $6. To get the most sticks, he should buy the cheaper wood, which is the 2 x 4 piece.

With $24, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Each 2 x 4 piece gives 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will give:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

So, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs. Each dog has 4 legs, so that's 6 dogs times 4 legs, which equals 24 legs. Each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, so we need to divide 24 legs by 2 to find out how many pairs of snowshoes we need. That's 24 divided by 2, which is 12 pairs. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply 12 pairs by $12.00 per pair. That's 12 times $12.00, which equals $144.00. So, the total cost for the snowshoes is $144.00.

The correct answer is: $144.00"
"Janet takes two bus trips each day, and each trip costs $2.20. So, the cost for one day is $4.40. Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is $22.00. But if she buys a weekly bus pass for $20, she would save $2.00. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's count the total number of animals:
- The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.
- The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

So, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is 40 + 80 = 120.

**Final Answer:**

"Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is 4 times what Sophia bought. So, if we divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4, we can find out how many Sophia bought.

For onions:
12 onions ÷ 4 = 3 onions

For potatoes:
4 potatoes ÷ 4 = 1 potato

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato. Adding them together:
3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items

The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4."

"Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. So, first, we find out how many kilometers she will run in total:

8 laps * 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Now, since she needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer, for 2 km, she will need:

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 ml of water."
"Julie started with $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. That means she spent:

\[ 500 \times 0.20 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on clothes. Now she has:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. That means she spent:

\[ 400 \times 0.25 = 100 \]

So, she spent $100 on CDs. Now she has:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, Julie has $300 left."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We know that a house and a lot together cost $120,000. Also, the house costs three times as much as the lot. 

Let's say the cost of the lot is \( L \). Then the cost of the house would be \( 3L \) because it's three times the cost of the lot. 

So, if we add the cost of the house and the lot, we get:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find the cost of the lot, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, the cost of the house is three times the cost of the lot:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she bought a total of 40 canvas bags. Each pack cost $4, so the total cost for 8 packs is $32. She sold each of the 40 canvas bags for $8, so the total revenue is $320. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $32 = $288. So, the profit Tara earned on her bags is $288."
"Joe throws 25 punches every minute. A fight has 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. So, the total time in minutes is 5 rounds times 3 minutes per round, which equals 15 minutes.

Josh made 9 cookies. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, so we multiply 9 by 2:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Kelsie made 18 cookies."
"Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. First, let's add up the money he has:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, Ali has $160 in total. He gives half of this to his sister:

\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, he has:

\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Next, he uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the money he has left is:

\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\)."

Now he has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left. On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems. So, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to do on Thursday.

The number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"Tony picks 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. Bobby picks 1 less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks 5 quarts per hour. Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so she picks 10 quarts per hour. Ricky picks 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts per hour. 

To find out how many quarts they can pick together in an hour, we add up their individual amounts:

Tony: 6 quarts
Bobby: 5 quarts
Kathy: 10 quarts
Ricky: 8 quarts

6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts

So, they can pick a total of 29 quarts of strawberries per hour."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, they baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning.

Then, they sold 93 loaves in the morning, so we subtract:
200 - 93 = 107 loaves left.

Next, they sold 39 more loaves in the afternoon, so we subtract again:
107 - 39 = 68 loaves left.

Finally, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves, so we add those back:
68 + 6 = 74 loaves left.

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74.

The answer is: 74"
"Jackson is planting tulips. He can fit 6 red tulips in a row and 8 blue tulips in a row. He buys 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips. To find out how many rows he will plant, we need to do some simple math.

For the red tulips:
- He has 36 red tulips.
- He can fit 6 red tulips in each row.
- So, the number of rows for red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

For the blue tulips:
- He has 24 blue tulips.
- He can fit 8 blue tulips in each row.
- So, the number of rows for blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \).

Now, we add the rows for both colors:
- Total rows = 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9.

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers."

For the oatmeal cookies, each batch needs \(\frac{3}{4}\) cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we do:

\[ \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much electricity Ada uses daily. She uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and if we assume she uses electricity for 24 hours a day, her daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh} \]

Now, let's find out her weekly consumption before adding the new device. Since there are 7 days in a week:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2016 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost of electricity is $1.50 per kilowatt-hour, so her weekly bill before adding the new device is:
\[ 2016 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3024 \, \text{\$} \]

Next, we add the new device which consumes 2 kilowatts per hour. So, the additional daily consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{kWh} \]

Her new daily consumption is:
\[ 288 \, \text{kWh} + 48 \, \text{kWh} = 336 \, \text{kWh} \]

Her new weekly consumption is:
\[ 336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2352 \, \text{kWh} \]

The cost of her new weekly bill is:
\[ 2352 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3528 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, the difference between her weekly bill before and after adding the new device is:
\[ 3528 \, \text{\$} - 3024 \, \text{\$} = 504 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to figure out how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's think about how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take them 10 days to paint a whole house.

Now, if 5 people are working together, they can do the work faster. Since one person takes 10 days, 5 people can do the same work in less time. We can divide the 10 days by 5 to find out how long it would take 5 people to paint a whole house:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ days}}{5} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can calculate the total hours it would take 5 people to paint a whole house:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The correct answer is: \boxed{48}"
"Ophelia and Jenna live in the same apartment building. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which means Jenna has 66 chairs. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 64 sofas. 

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, and Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs. So, the total number of sofas is 20 + 64 = 84, and the total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88. 

Adding the total number of sofas and chairs together, we get 84 + 88 = 172.

"Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. He paid a total of $48. To find out how much the headphone set cost, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount he paid:

\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set cost $44. If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $44 left to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one CD to find out how many more CDs he could buy:

\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

So, Tom could buy 11 more CDs if he didn't buy the headphone set.

The answer is: 11"
"Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for some weeks. He worked out for 5 hours for 2 weeks and for 6 hours for 1 week. 

To find the total hours, we first calculate the hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours. Since there are 8 weeks in total and he worked out 5 hours for 2 weeks and 6 hours for 1 week, the number of weeks he worked out 4 hours is:

8 - 2 - 1 = 5 weeks

So, the total hours for these 5 weeks is:
5 weeks * 4 hours/week = 20 hours

Next, we calculate the hours for the weeks he worked out 5 hours:
2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours

And for the week he worked out 6 hours:
1 week * 6 hours/week = 6 hours

Adding all these together gives us the total hours:
20 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 36 hours

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
36 hours

The correct answer is: 36"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 people got off, the number of people who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 people get off. So, the number of people left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 people got off, the number of people who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

So, the number of people riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so he is currently 22 years old. In 8 years, Jame will be 30 years old. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. Twice Jame's age in 8 years is 60, so his cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years. This means his cousin is currently 55 - 8 = 47 years old. The difference in their ages now is 47 - 22 = 25 years.

"Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700. The total cost of the computer and the printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. So, the cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. Since there are 2 monitors, the cost of one monitor is $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

The cost of one monitor is $300."
"Each boy brought back 60 seashells. The girls brought back 60 plus four times 60 seashells. So, it's 60 + 4 * 60 = 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

"Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, who is 10 years old, so Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old.

Answer: Anne is 8 years old."
"Sure, let's figure out the total thickness of the four books.

The first book is 31 mm thick.
The second book is 50 mm thick.
The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.
The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 × 31 = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add them up:
31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"Emma has a goal of making 72 vlogs each month. So far, she has made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Let's add these up:

18 + 21 + 15 = 54

She needs to make 72 vlogs in total. So, we need to find out how many more she needs to make:

72 - 54 = 18

Emma needs to make 18 vlogs in the fourth week to reach her goal. So, the answer is 18."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the tip is. The tip is 20% of $50. So, we calculate 20% of $50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, the tip is $10. Now, we add this tip to the original bill to get the total amount:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Now, we need to split this total amount evenly. Since there are two people, we divide the total by 2:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, you end up paying $30."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each boy gets when $18 is shared among 3 boys. So, we divide $18 by 3:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]
Each boy gets $6.

Now, the eldest boy does some actions:
1. He adds $5 to his $6:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]
2. The next day, he adds another $10:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]
3. He spends $8:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]
4. He then triples the amount he has left:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]"
"Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so he splits the month into two halves, each with 15 days. Let's say he saves $x each day in the first half. In the second half, he saves twice as much, so he saves $2x each day.

For the first half:
- He saves $x each day for 15 days, so he saves a total of $15x.

For the second half:
- He saves $2x each day for 15 days, so he saves a total of $30x.

Adding both halves together, his total savings for the month are:
- $15x + $30x = $45x.

We know his total savings goal is $1125, so:
- $45x = $1125.

To find out how much he saves each day in the second half, we need to solve for $x$:
- $x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25$.

Since he saves twice as much in the second half:
- $2x = 2 \times 25 = 50$.

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month.

The correct answer is: \boxed{50}"
"Verna bought some fruits. She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, 5 oranges at $0.80 each, and 6 peaches at $0.75 each. She gave $20.

First, let's find out how much she spent on each type of fruit:
- For apples: 3 apples × $1.50 = $4.50
- For oranges: 5 oranges × $0.80 = $4.00
- For peaches: 6 peaches × $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up the total cost:
$4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"Jairus gets $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, Jairus's total is:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \]
Jenny gets $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, Jenny's total is:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \]
To find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \]
So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have 100 dollars to divide between Jeff and Brad. Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. Together, they get 100 dollars, so we can write it as:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide 100 by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so that's 6 miles a day. If he works 5 days a week, then he walks 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles/week. So, the answer is 30 miles."
"Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written.

First, she writes the alphabet in full twice:
- The alphabet has 26 letters.
- Writing it once: 26 letters.
- Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

Next, she writes half of the alphabet once:
- Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
- Writing half of it once: 13 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written:
- The total number of letters written so far is \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
- Re-writing everything: 65 letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(52 + 13 + 65 = 130\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{130}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 families.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 families.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so that's 27 times 3, which is 81 families.

So, during the fourth round, 81 families will be notified.

The answer is: \boxed{81}"
"Mark lost 10 pounds every month for 3 months. So, the total weight he lost is 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds. If his final weight is 70 pounds, then his initial weight was 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, the answer is 100 pounds."
"Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. James's play set has 80 toys, so five times that is 400 toys. If Jonathan needs 2 more toys to have 400, then he must have 398 toys right now.

So, the answer is: 398"
"Sure, let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend on his school supplies.

First, we'll add up the cost of each item he wants to buy:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. So, we need to find 10% of $30.00:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

So, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."
"Carly wants to treat her friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each, and five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers:
5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

Next, the cost of the potato fries:
10 packs * $0.30 each = $3

Then, the cost of the fruit drinks:
5 cans * $2 each = $10

Now, let's add these amounts to find the total cost:
$20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is:
$50 - $33 = $17

The change Carly gets back is $17."
"If you sell goods worth $1000, you get $300. For anything over $1000, you get 10% more. So, if you sell $2500 worth of goods, the first $1000 gives you $300, and the rest, which is $1500, gives you 10% of $1500. 

10% of $1500 is:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

So, you get $300 from the first $1000 and $150 from the next $1500. Adding these together:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

The total amount Antonella earned is $450."
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has:

2 cases × 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

He has 70 guests and wants to give each guest 2 bottles. So, he needs:

70 guests × 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the bottles he already has from the total he needs:

140 bottles needed - 48 bottles he has = 92 bottles

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water.

The answer is 92."
"When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water. So, twice 16 minutes is 32 minutes, and adding 2 minutes makes it 34 minutes for a mile in warm water.

To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles in each condition, we multiply the time for one mile by 3.

In cold water, it takes:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

In warm water, it takes:
\[ 34 \times 3 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"John works 5 hours a day and gets paid $2 per hour. So, each day he earns:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$2/\text{hour} = \$10 \text{ per day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ \$10 \text{ per day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = \$40 \text{ per week} \]

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him, we divide $80 by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{\$80}{\$40 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take John \(\boxed{2}\) weeks to save $80."
"Sure, let's figure out the total cost for my lunch today at Subway.

The foot-long fish sub costs $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times that, so it's \(3 \times 40 = 120\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost, I add the two amounts together:
\[40 + 120 = 160\]

So, the total cost for my lunch today is $160."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We have a bag with 21 buttons. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each, and the rest have 4 holes each.

First, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. We do this by subtracting the 7 buttons with 2 holes from the total number of buttons:
21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 2 holes:
7 buttons * 2 holes = 14 holes.

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 4 holes:
14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes.

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70."
"Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, so that's 24 divided by 2, which is 12 cubic inches. Peter's locker is a quarter of Zack's, so that's 12 divided by 4, which is 3 cubic inches.

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Octavia drinks half the recommended amount, which is 4 cups. So, Octavia drinks 2 cups a day (4 divided by 2). Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so he drinks 20 cups a day (10 times 2). His doctor says he should drink 4 cups a day. So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by 16 cups a day (20 minus 4).

The answer is: 16"
"The pet shop has 6 cages in total. Out of these, 3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 times 10, which is 30 hamsters. The other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 guinea pigs. Adding the hamsters and guinea pigs together, we get 30 plus 15, which equals 45. So, the pet shop has 45 rodents in total.

The answer is 45."
"Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 * 130 = 260 pounds. 

To find the total weight of the three friends, we add their weights together: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. 

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"The sun starts at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when it is at the tip of the pyramid. It moves 5 degrees every hour straight upward. If it moves for 10 hours, the total movement is 50 degrees. So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

The correct answer is 82 degrees."
"James has two sons. One is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 8 years old. That means James needs 12 candles for the first son and 8 candles for the second son. In total, he needs 20 candles.

Each pack of candles has 5 candles and costs $3. To get 20 candles, James needs to buy 4 packs. So, the total cost is 4 packs times $3 per pack, which equals $12.

\[ 51 = 3 \times (N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( N \):

\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each tooth, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half of $1.00, which is $0.50, so that's \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.

Now, let's add it all up:
\[5 + 3 + 1 = 9\]

So, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9}\) dollars."
"Richie scored 80 goals. Mark scored 20 goals less than Richie, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. Anna scored 45 goals less than Richie, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

"Liam said he made $63, and Mitchell said he sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. So, Mitchell made 21 times $4, which is $84. To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings: $84 - $63 = $21.

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

The correct answer is: $21."
"Peter has $70 and wants to spend it equally over 7 days. From Sunday to Wednesday, he spends $10 each day, so that's $10 x 4 = $40 on wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5, so he buys $40 ÷ $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

He has $70 - $40 = $30 left for the rest of the week. From Thursday to Saturday, he spends $10 each day, so that's $10 x 3 = $30 on plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2, so he buys $30 ÷ $2 = 15 plastic action figures.

In total, he buys 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures.

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 23."
"Sure, let's add up the costs step by step.

So, the total cost so far is \(\boxed{308}\)."
"Ford grows 40 roses every week. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second orders 15 roses, and the third orders 30 roses. So, the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops each week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. 

In a month, there are about 4 weeks. So, Ford grows 40 roses/week * 4 weeks = 160 roses in a month. 

The flower shops order 65 roses/week * 4 weeks = 260 roses in a month. 

Ford needs 260 roses but only grows 160 roses, so he lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses.

The answer is 100."
"Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account. She takes out $100 every month. In 2 years, there are 24 months. So, she takes out $100 for 24 months, which is $100 * 24 = $2400. To find out how much is left, we subtract the amount she took out from her starting amount: $3000 - $2400 = $600. 

So, the money left in her account after 2 years is $600."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much they make from selling the sandwiches. They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so:
\[ 10 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

Next, we need to know how much it costs to make those 10 sandwiches. The cost of the bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00, and the cost of the cheese and condiments is $30.00, so:
\[ \$3.00 + \$30.00 = \$33.00 \]

Now, to find out how much profit they make, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00 \]

So, the net profit is \$37.00.

**Final Answer:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out the area of the bedroom. The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so the area is:
   \[
   18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the cost for the carpet is:
   \[
   216 \times 12 = 2592 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the cost for the padding is:
   \[
   216 \times 2 = 432 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. The old carpet removal costs $4 per square foot, so the cost for removal is:
   \[
   216 \times 4 = 864 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. The installation of the new carpet costs $34 per square foot, so the cost for installation is:
   \[
   216 \times 34 = 7344 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. Now, we add all these costs together to get the total cost:
   \[
   2592 + 432 + 864 + 7344 = 11232 \text{ dollars}

"Mack counted birds over a week. He saw 50 birds on the first and second days, 0 birds on the third day, 120 birds on the fourth and fifth days, 20 birds on the sixth day, and 90 birds on the seventh day. To find out how many birds he saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

So, let's add them up:
- First and second days: 50 birds
- Third day: 0 birds
- Fourth and fifth days: 120 birds
- Sixth day: 20 birds
- Seventh day: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total by the number of days, which is 7:
280 ÷ 7 = 40

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day.

The answer is 40."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Diane started with 20.
2. She added half of 20 to it, which is 10. So, 20 + 10 = 30.
3. Then she divided 30 by 5, which is 6.
4. Finally, she multiplied 6 by the difference between 20 and 12, which is 8. So, 6 × 8 = 48.

"Maggie's oven is a bit off. When she sets it to 450, it actually gets to 468. That means it's a little too hot, about 4% too hot. If she needs it to be 520 degrees, she should set it a bit lower to make up for that extra heat. The answer is 500 degrees."
"Sure, let's figure out how long it will take Max to watch the two movies.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes. So, 2 hours is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 + 5 = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for both movies:
\[ 90 + 125 = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies."
"Juan's house is 30% less than Herb's house, which cost $76,000. To find out how much less, we take 30% of $76,000:

\[ 30\% \times 76000 = 0.30 \times 76000 = 22800 \]

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less than $76,000. Now, we subtract that from $76,000 to find the price of Juan's house:

\[ 76000 - 22800 = 53200 \]

Now, to find the total value of both houses, we add the price of Juan's house to the price of Herb's house:

\[ 76000 + 53200 = 129200 \]

So, the total value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Judy bought 12 cups and twice as many dishes, which means she bought 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 44 dishes. 

To find the total number of utensils, we add the cups and dishes together. Judy brought 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils. Her friend brought 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils. 

Adding both totals together, we get 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that one box of contacts costs $100.00 and there's a 10% discount. So, we need to find out how much the discount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the price of one box after the discount:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 3 hours. She gets paid $10 an hour, so she earned 3 hours * $10 = $30.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours. He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours. In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours. He also gets paid $10 an hour, so he earned 7 hours * $10 = $70.

To find out how much more John earned than Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings: $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

The correct answer is: $40."
"Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She does aerobics for 2 hours, burning 500 calories per hour, and runs for 1 hour, burning 600 calories.

First, calculate the calories burned from aerobics:
2 hours * 500 calories/hour = 1000 calories

Then, calculate the calories burned from running:
1 hour * 600 calories/hour = 600 calories

Now, add the calories burned from both activities:
1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories

Next, calculate the amount of water she needs:
1600 calories / 200 calories = 8
8 * 100 ml = 800 ml

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

Answer: 800 ml"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. The note on the jar says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

Then, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

And the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Jared starts with typing at 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he increases his speed by 5 more WPM, his new speed will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

To find the average of these three speeds, we add them together and then divide by 3.

So, the total is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.

Now, we divide 156 by 3 to get the average:

156 ÷ 3 = 52.

The average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The correct answer is: 52."
"If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds each week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds each week. At the end of 5 weeks, the difference in his weight will be 15 pounds.

So, the answer is 15 pounds."
"Alex is inviting 100 people via email. Each of these 100 people will invite 2 more friends, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 more people. Alex also calls 10 friends, and 8 of them will bring their spouses, so that's 8 friends plus 8 spouses, which is 16 more people. Adding all these together, we get 100 (initial invites) + 200 (friends of initial invites) + 16 (spouses) = 316 people. So, Alex will need 316 seats. 

The answer is 316."
"The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 20 pounds. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 5 pounds. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{220}\) pounds."
"The boots cost $16 on Amazon and $13 on eBay. But the shipping on Amazon is $4, while on eBay, it's twice that, so $8. 

On Amazon, the total is $16 (boots) + $4 (shipping) = $20.
On eBay, the total is $13 (boots) + $8 (shipping) = $21.

So, the boots are $21 - $20 = $1 more expensive on eBay.

The answer is $1."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and doubles every day. We need to find out how many days it takes to be taller than 20 feet.

- On Day 1, the beanstalk is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.
- On Day 2, the beanstalk is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet tall.
- On Day 3, the beanstalk is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet tall.

So, on Day 3, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is more than 20 feet. 

Therefore, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. Each 100 grams of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein. So, for 200 grams, we can calculate the protein as follows:

First, find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms:
\[ 200 \text{ grams} \times \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \]

Now, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7:
\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]

So, the answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's think about this step by step.

If we say Jerry is \( J \) years old now, then 5 years ago he was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, his current age is twice what he was 5 years ago, so we can write:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

If we move \( 2J \) to the left side, we get:

\[ J - 2J = -10 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ -J = -10 \]

So, \( J = 10 \). This means Jerry is 10 years old now.

In 3 years, he will be:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, that's 2 times $2000, which is $4000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost is $4000 plus $500, which is $4500. He has already paid $600 as a deposit, so he still needs $4500 minus $600, which is $3900. He makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide $3900 by $15, which is 260 hours. So, George needs to work 260 hours to have enough money for the dental work.

260"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's say the smallest angle is \(x\). Then, one angle is twice the smallest, so it's \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest, so it's \(3x\).

So, we have:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

Now, to find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other angles are:
\[2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\]
\[3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\]

The largest angle is 90 degrees.

So, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"Colby has different types of coins. Let's count how many nickels he can get from all his coins.

- He has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is worth 5 nickels, 8 quarters are worth \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- He has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is worth 2 nickels, 6 dimes are worth \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- He has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so he has 14 nickels.
- He has 15 pennies. Since 5 pennies make 1 nickel, 15 pennies are worth \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add all the nickels together:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**
69"
"Okay, let's count the legs of the pets in the store.

- Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 legs.
- Cats have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats, so that's 2 times 4, which is 8 legs.
- Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 legs.

Now, let's add them all up:
20 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from cats) + 20 legs (from birds) = 48 legs.

So, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases it by 50%, so he adds half of 8 pounds to 8 pounds. Half of 8 is 4, so he uses:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

But 12 pounds is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. So, he uses:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight he now uses is 10 pounds."
"Steve starts with 5 games for his birthday. Over the next three years, he gets more games. In the first year, he buys 1 game each month, so that's 12 games. In the second year, he buys 2 games each month, which is 24 games. In the third year, he buys 4 games each month, so that's 48 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas each year, and that's 3 years, so that's 15 more games. 

Adding them all up:
5 (birthday) + 12 (first year) + 24 (second year) + 48 (third year) + 15 (Christmas) = 104 games.

So, the total number of games Steve has after 3 years is 104."
"To figure out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we first need to know how fast the plane is going. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so we can find the speed by dividing the distance by the time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes to travel 2000 miles at this speed, we use the same formula but in reverse. We divide the distance by the speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

"Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, in 1 hour, he can make 60 pounds. Marissa can make 3/4 times as much as Ruiz in 1 hour, which is 45 pounds. If they work for 12 hours, Ruiz can make 720 pounds (60 pounds/hour * 12 hours) and Marissa can make 1080 pounds (45 pounds/hour * 12 hours). Together, they can make 1800 pounds of chocolates. So, the answer is 1800 pounds."
"Howard spends $8 on Monday. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as Monday, so that's $8 \times 2 = $16. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's $16 \times 4 = $64. Adding it all up, he spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88. If he started with $100, then he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

So, the answer is $12."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.
- So, for each hour, he earned 15 * $0.50 = $7.50.
- For four hours, he earned 4 * $7.50 = $30.

Next, for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.
- So, for each hour, he earned 10 * $0.60 = $6.00.
- For two hours, he earned 2 * $6.00 = $12.

Now, let's add the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many rotations the tires make in a month. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, and for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. So, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
   \[
   \frac{400}{2} \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many rotations the tires make in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \[
   145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
   \]

3. Now, we know each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced. To find out how many years it will take for the tire to reach this limit, we divide the total rotations by the yearly rotations:
   \[
   \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \text{ years}
   \]

So, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and gives 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to find the cost of each pump in cents.

First, we find out how many washings one pump gives:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, we calculate the cost per washing:
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Then, we find the cost for 60 washings (which is the cost of one pump):
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Finally, we convert the cost per pump to cents:
\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy clothes for his field trip. There's a 30% off sale. The shirt he wants costs $25, and the shorts he wants cost $35. 

First, let's find out how much the shirt will cost after the discount. The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35 and there's no discount mentioned, so they will stay at $35.

Now, let's add the cost of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe only has $50, so he doesn't have enough money to buy both items. He will be short by:
\[ 52.50 - 50 = 2.50 \]

Since he can't buy both, he will have:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Juan wants to make croissants. He plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. To find out how much butter he needs, we first calculate the total number of dozens he will make in a week:

\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

We know that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, for 28 dozen croissants, the amount of butter needed is:

\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to do some math.

First, we calculate the cost for Monica's street:
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.
- It costs $194 per meter.
- So, the total cost for Monica's street is 150 * $194 = $29,100.

Next, we calculate the cost for Lewis' street:
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.
- It also costs $194 per meter.
- So, the total cost for Lewis' street is 490 * $194 = $95,060.

Now, we find the difference in cost:
- The difference is $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960.

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

The final answer is $65,960."
"John started his research with $100,000 for the first 5 months. After that, it took 10 times longer, so that's 45 months total, minus the first 5 months leaves 40 months. For those 40 months, the cost was 50% more than the initial $100,000, which is $150,000 per month.

So, for the first 5 months, the cost was $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.
For the remaining 40 months, the cost was $150,000 * 40 = $6,000,000.

Adding these together, the total cost is $500,000 + $6,000,000 = $6,500,000.

The total cost of John's research is $6,500,000."
"The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. The second player ate 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is 16 ounces. The fourth and fifth players had vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Adding it all up:
6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces."

Next, we know that each person in the group posts 3 times a day. There are 1000 people in the group.

So, each day, the group makes \(1000 \times 3 = 3000\) posts.

Now, to find out how many posts are made in March, we multiply the daily posts by the number of days in March:

\[3000 \times 31 = 93000\]

So, the total number of posts in March is 93000."
"Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load uses 20 gallons of water, and water costs $0.15 per gallon. To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to do some calculations.

First, we find out how much water Gary uses in a week:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Next, we calculate how much water he uses in a year:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the water used in a year:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year. The answer is:

"Sure, let's add up what Scarlett spent on her aquarium and other items.

1. Aquarium: $10.00
2. Rocks: 2 bags at $2.50 each, so \(2 \times 2.50 = 5.00\)
3. Coral: 3 pieces at $2.00 each, so \(3 \times 2.00 = 6.00\)
4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each, so \(20 \times 0.50 = 10.00\)
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add all these up:

"Prince is a butcher who sells 15 kg of meat every hour. He works 10 hours a day, so he sells:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount he sells each day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, so:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Now, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the number of remaining seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. To find the number of seats occupied by the students, we subtract the number of seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many street lights are on each pole. Each pole has 4 street lights.

Next, we know there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, at one intersection, the number of street lights is:
\[ 4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Now, there are 4 intersections. So, the total number of street lights at all intersections is:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

But we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. So, the number of functioning street lights is:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is \(\boxed{76}\)."

The total cost of John's physical therapy is $3000."
"Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 1 piece every 2 hours at school for 8 hours, so that's 4 pieces. After school, he has 20 - 4 = 16 pieces. He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so that's 2 more pieces. Now he has 16 - 2 = 14 pieces. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives 14 / 2 = 7 pieces. That leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces.

So, at the end of the day, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left."

"The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so he spent:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ dollars} \]

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so he spent:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract the baseball coach's spending from the basketball coach's spending:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the basketball coach spent \(\boxed{85}\) dollars more than the baseball coach."
"Arianna has a garden with 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Now, we know that 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we take 4/5 of the total number of flowers:

(4/5) * 200 = 160 flowers

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is 160.

Answer: 160"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second. We need to convert this to Mb per hour.

1. Convert kb to Mb:
   - 1 Mb = 1000 kb
   - So, 20 kb is 20 ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.

2. Convert seconds to hours:
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 × 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.
   - Now, we multiply 0.02 Mb per second by 3600 seconds to get Mb per hour:
   - 0.02 × 3600 = 72 Mb per hour.

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for three days, it would be:
10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars

Next, for the remaining four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day. So, it pulled:
10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day
For four days, it would be:
6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

Now, to find the total number of cars towed in the week, we add the cars from the first three days and the remaining four days:
30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\boxed{54}"
"Adam wants to ride the biggest roller coaster, but he needs to be 4 feet tall. Right now, Adam is 40 inches tall. He grows 2 inches every year. We need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow to 4 feet.

First, let's convert Adam's height to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Now, let's find out how much more he needs to grow to reach 4 feet:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches each year, which is:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam needs 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each. So, the total money he got from selling the cars is:

\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of the price to get the cars. So, the cost to the company for each car is:

\[ 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500 \]

For 10 cars, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000 \]

The profit is the total money from selling the cars minus the total cost:

\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit. So, his commission is:

\[ 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500 \]

So, the amount James made is:

\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. There are 100 surfers in total.
2. Only 25% of them can stay on the wave when it's big and over 30 feet.
3. To find out how many that is, we do \(100 \times 0.25 = 25\).
4. Out of these 25, 60% are women, so 40% must be men.
5. To find out how many men that is, we do \(25 \times 0.40 = 10\).

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

Next, the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Then, the price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, we add up the prices of all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

So, the total price for all three jewels is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"Max bought some stamps at the post office. He bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. To find the total number of stamps, we add them all up: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45. So, Max bought 45 stamps in all.

The answer is 45."
"Tom is driving faster than Bob, and he needs to close the gap between them. Tom drives at 70 miles per hour, and Bob drives at 55 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the difference in their speeds.

So, the time it takes for Tom to catch up is:
\[ \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

The answer is 5 hours."
"Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

The answer is 14."
"Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60. His parents told him that if the cost per class is more than $10, they won't sign him up again. There are 10 total classes. We need to find out how many classes he can miss.

First, let's figure out the cost per class if he doesn't miss any classes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Now, let's say he misses \( x \) classes. Then he attends \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class would be:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to make sure this cost is not more than $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve this, we can multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Now, let's move the terms around:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10 (and remember to flip the inequality sign):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Julie works twice as fast as Jewel. Jewel processes 50 customers a day, so Julie processes 100 customers a day because 50 times 2 is 100. Together, they process 150 customers a day (50 from Jewel and 100 from Julie). In a week, which has 7 days, they process 1050 customers (150 customers per day times 7 days). So, the total weekly production for the two is 1050 customers."
"Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so Reggie ran \(5 \times 4 = 20\) miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran \(20 - 3 = 17\) miles.

Lynn ran 17 miles."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one apple costs. If four apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much one orange costs. If three oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples will cost. Since one apple costs $1.30, 5 apples will cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to find out how much 5 oranges will cost. Since one orange costs $1.10, 5 oranges will cost:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges to get the total cost:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars for 5 apples and 5 oranges."
"To figure out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to know how much earth he has to shovel. The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find out the total amount of earth, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, if it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot of earth, we need to multiply the total cubic feet by the time it takes to shovel each cubic foot:

\[ 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"Sure, let's add up the costs step by step:

1. Base price of the truck: $30,000
2. King cab upgrade: $7,500
3. Leather seats: One-third of the king cab, so $7,500 / 3 = $2,500
4. Running boards: $500 less than leather seats, so $2,500 - $500 = $2,000
5. Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Now, let's add them all together:

$30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Tim got a raise of 5% on his $20000 monthly salary. So, the raise is:

\[ 5\% \times 20000 = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000 \]

So, his new monthly salary is:

\[ 20000 + 1000 = 21000 \]

He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 20000 = 10000 \]

So, his total monthly salary with the bonus is:

\[ 21000 + 10000 = 31000 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly salary by 12:

\[ 31000 \times 12 = 372000 \]

So, Tim will make $372000 in a year."
"James buys a new wardrobe. He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants. He also buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. The suits cost $750 each, the dress pants cost 1/5 of the suit price, and the dress shirts cost $60 each.

First, let's find out how much the suits cost:
10 suits * $750 each = $7500

Next, let's find out how much the dress pants cost:
Each dress pant costs 1/5 of $750, so:
$750 / 5 = $150
10 dress pants * $150 each = $1500

Now, let's find out how much the dress shirts cost:
He buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, so:
10 suits * 3 dress shirts = 30 dress shirts
30 dress shirts * $60 each = $1800

Finally, let's add up all the costs:
$7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800

So, the total cost is $10800."
"Sure, let's figure this out together. The first website makes 20 news articles every day. There are 28 days in February, so for the first website, that's 20 times 28, which equals 560 articles.

The second website makes 10 business news articles every day. Again, there are 28 days in February, so that's 10 times 28, which equals 280 articles.

Now, to find the total number of articles both websites make together, we add the two numbers: 560 plus 280, which gives us 840 articles.

So, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is 840."
"Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older, so she is 64. Their son is half his mom's age, which makes him 32. His son's wife is 3 years younger than him, so she is 29.

The answer is 29."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion is 2 kilograms. So, to find out how much flour is in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

This means one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour. Now, if we have three bags, we need to find out the total amount of flour in all three bags. So, we multiply the amount of flour in one bag by 3:

\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"Alisa biked 12 miles every hour for 4.5 hours, so we do 12 times 4.5 which is 54 miles. Stanley biked 10 miles every hour for 2.5 hours, so we do 10 times 2.5 which is 25 miles. To find the total miles they biked together, we add 54 and 25 which gives us 79 miles. So, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"Bill is digging a well in his backyard. He digs 4 feet every hour through soil and half that speed through clay. He has to dig 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay.

First, let's figure out how long it takes to dig the soil:
- He digs 4 feet per hour.
- He needs to dig 24 feet.
- So, it takes \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's figure out how long it takes to dig the clay:
- He digs half as fast through clay, so that's \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig 8 feet.
- So, it takes \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we add the time for both:
- Total time = time through soil + time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well."
"Howie wants to give cupcakes to everyone in his class and himself, plus his teacher. He thinks people might want vanilla or chocolate, so he plans to get one of each for everyone. He has 25 classmates, so that's 26 people in total (including himself and the teacher). Each person will get 2 cupcakes. So, we need to multiply 26 by 2 to find out how many cupcakes he needs to buy.

26 people × 2 cupcakes per person = 52 cupcakes

So, Howie should buy 52 cupcakes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Fishio got 2000 likes after 1 week.
2. Three weeks later, she had 70 times the initial likes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2000 \times 70 = 140000
   \]
3. Recently, she got 20000 more likes. So, we add this to the 140000 likes:
   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

So, the total number of likes is:
\[
\boxed{160000}

"Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final cost for Clara was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \text{ dollars} \]

The next day, the price of pomegranates shot up to $30 each. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates, so the initial cost was:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount was:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final cost for Sheila was:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

The difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Ariadne sells hats in her shop. In one month, she made $400 from red hats. This amount is half of what she made from green hats. So, the amount from green hats is $400 \times 2 = $800. The total for that month is $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the next month, she made \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month. So, the amount for the second month is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\).

The total amount she made in two months is $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.

The final answer is:

"James hires a carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours total. He gets 1 hour free, so he pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. Each hour after that costs twice as much, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

So, the cost for the first hour is $15, and the cost for the next two hours is $30 * 2 = $60.

Adding these together, the total cost is $15 + $60 = $75.

The answer is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Sally's bank went from $200 to $420. So, she got $420 - $200 = $220 more. Her wage should be $300, but she only has $220. So, they took $300 - $220 = $80 from her wage.

The amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80."
"Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. So, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is 16 guests times 3 halves per guest, which equals 48 halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the total number of whole eggs needed is 48 halves divided by 2 halves per egg, which equals 24 eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total dozens of eggs needed is 24 eggs divided by 12 eggs per dozen, which equals 2 dozens.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She has already written one-third of it. One-third of 15 pages is 5 pages. So, she has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.

"Mike has a book with 200 pages and he needs to finish it in 30 days. He plans to read 10 pages each day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish, we can do the math:

200 pages ÷ 10 pages per day = 20 days

So, Mike will finish reading the book in 20 days. This means he will finish 10 days before the deadline because the deadline is 30 days and he will finish in 20 days.

10 days"
"James buys a plane for $150,000. He pays $5,000 a month to rent a hanger and spends twice that on fuel, which is $10,000 a month. So, the total cost per month is $5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000. For a year, that's $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000. Adding the initial cost of the plane, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

The final answer is $330,000."
"Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork. It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice. If it took 30 minutes to cook the rice, then it took 50 minutes to cook the pork (30 + 20 = 50). The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, which is 80 minutes (30 + 50 = 80, then 80 / 2 = 40). So, the total time to cook all the food is 120 minutes (30 + 50 + 40 = 120).

The correct answer is \boxed{120}."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 1/2 pound of almonds costs. Since a pound of almonds costs $10, 1/2 pound would cost:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much 1/3 pound of walnuts costs. Since a pound of walnuts costs $15, 1/3 pound would cost:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out the cost for the second mixture. For 1/5 pound of almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

And for 1/3 pound of walnuts, we already know it's $5.

So, the total cost for the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) is:
\[ 2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much more the first mixture costs than the second, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step. We know that sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. We are given that the total number of heads is 20 and the total number of legs is 70.

Let's say the number of sheep is \( S \) and the number of geese is \( G \).

From the heads, we know:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

From the legs, we know:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the legs equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To find \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( 15 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Roger went to the store to buy coffee. The coffee he usually buys costs $5 per pound, but his favorite brand was sold out, so he had to buy a more expensive brand that costs 20% more. 

First, let's find out how much the more expensive coffee costs. If the usual coffee is $5 and it's 20% more, we calculate 20% of $5:
\[ 5 \times 0.20 = 1 \]
So, the more expensive coffee costs:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Roger needs a week's worth of coffee, and he uses 1 pound per day. That means he needs:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]
The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

He also bought a donut for $2. So, the total cost is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. 

First, let's add up the cost of the chips: 
2 bags × $2.00 = $4.00

Next, the cost of the fried chicken is $8.00.

And the cost of the soda is $1.00.

Now, let's add all these up:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent $20.00 in total. So, the cost of the apple pie is:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

The apple pie cost $7.00."
"James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He gives 198 to District A and 209 to District C. To find out how many he gives to District B, we need to subtract the newspapers given to District A and C from the total.

"John takes a cooking class that meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks. To find out how many recipes he learns, we need to calculate the total hours he spends in the class and then figure out how many recipes he learns based on that time.

First, let's find the total hours:
- He meets 4 times a week.
- Each meeting is 2 hours long.
- The class lasts for 6 weeks.

So, the total hours are:
\[ 4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we know he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, we divide the total hours by 1.5 to find the number of recipes:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We have 150 teachers on the basketball court. Out of these, 60% are history teachers. To find out how many history teachers there are, we calculate 60% of 150:

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find out how many math teachers there are, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours."
"Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Aurelia has, so Kassidy has:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has:

\[
90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Together, they have:

\[
150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they share the money equally, each gets:

\[
\frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"The game has 4 quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the quarters is:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

But there was a tie in the last quarter, so they added 5 more minutes. So, the total time for the game is:

\[ 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

The entire game lasted 53 minutes."
"In a company with 50 employees, 20% are management. So, we first find out how many are management:

\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Out of these 10 management employees, 30% oversee the entire company. So, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3."
"To make 16 muffins, Svetlana needs to use the following amounts of dry ingredients:

- Flour: Each muffin needs 5 tablespoons, so for 16 muffins, she needs \(16 \times 5 = 80\) tablespoons.
- Sugar: Each muffin needs 3 tablespoons, so for 16 muffins, she needs \(16 \times 3 = 48\) tablespoons.
- Salt: Each muffin needs 0.25 tablespoons, so for 16 muffins, she needs \(16 \times 0.25 = 4\) tablespoons.

Adding these together, the total tablespoons of dry ingredients needed are \(80 + 48 + 4 = 132\).

So, the answer is 132 tablespoons."
"Sure, let's figure this out together. Robert has 3 pounds of candy, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. If we add all the candy together, we get:

3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds

Now, they want to share the candy equally. Since there are 3 of them, we divide the total candy by 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

The answer is 4 pounds."
"Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B. One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75. Let's calculate the total cost.

For type A candies:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

For type B candies:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid $15, so the change he got is:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Adam got is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Christina has been recording her mood for 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Her first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the following 8 days were neutral. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good. 

To find out how many good days are left, we need to see how many good days she already has. She had 8 good days at the start and 2 more good days in the next 3 days. So, she has 8 + 2 = 10 good days.

Since she had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left is 12 - 10 = 2.

So, the number of good days left in the month is 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that Janey has 21 books and that she has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. So, if we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey's books can be represented as \( 2S + 3 \).

Since Janey has 21 books, we can write the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

Now, let's solve for \( S \). First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. Right now, it is 20 feet tall. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 20 feet is 240 inches. The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches. So, it needs to grow 600 - 240 = 360 inches more. If it grows 30 inches each day, it will take 360 / 30 = 12 days to grow the extra 360 inches. So, the answer is 12 days.

\boxed{12}
\]"
"James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. Then, 8 more dogs come, making it 12 dogs in total. So, he needs 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs. 

Next, the number of dogs doubles, so now there are 24 dogs. He needs 12 more toys to have enough for 24 dogs.

After that, 3 dogs leave, so he has 21 dogs. He doesn't need to buy any more toys because the 3 dogs that left don't need toys anymore.

So, the total number of toys James needs is 20.

**Answer: 20**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. The total amount invested is $1200.
2. Dylan invested \( \frac{2}{5} \) of $1200.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
   \]
3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]
4. Frances invested \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining $720.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
   \]
5. After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240

"Karen earns twice what Lorie earns. Lorie earns $10 per hour, so Karen earns $20 per hour. If Karen works 3 hours each day for 2 days, she works a total of 6 hours. So, Karen earns $20 for each hour, and for 6 hours, she earns $20 * 6 = $120. 

The answer is $120."
"If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then to find out how many hash browns 96 potatoes can make, we can set it up like this:

First, we see that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. So, for 96 potatoes, we need to find out how many times 96 is of 6. That is:

96 ÷ 6 = 16

This means 96 potatoes are 16 times the amount of 6 potatoes. Since 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we multiply 36 by 16:

36 × 16 = 576

So, 96 potatoes can make 576 hash browns.

"The elevator can hold a maximum of 700 kg. Each adult weighs about 80 kg. If Jack and 8 other adults get in, the total weight is:

\[ 8 \times 80 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so they are:

\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

They have exceeded the elevator's limit by 20 kg."
"Katarina has 68 cookies. Max has 5 more cookies than Katarina, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, let's add up all the cookies:
Katarina: 68
Max: 73
Cookie Monster: 61
Summer: 96

Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Shania is making her dress longer. She adds 50% of the original length and then adds 20 cm more. The final length is 140 cm.

Let's say the original length of the dress is \( x \) cm. When she adds 50% of the original length, it becomes \( x + 0.5x \), which is the same as \( 1.5x \). Then she adds 20 cm more, so the equation is:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Now, we need to find \( x \). First, we subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The answer is: \(\boxed{80}\)"
"Chris has a lawn mower that he can use in two different speeds. In the slower speed, he can mow the whole lawn in 60 minutes. In the faster speed, he can mow the whole lawn in 40 minutes. Today, he decided to mow half the lawn in the slower speed and the other half in the faster speed.

To find out how long it took him, we need to calculate the time for each half separately.

For the slower speed:
- He mows half the lawn in 30 minutes (since 60 minutes for the whole lawn divided by 2).

For the faster speed:
- He mows half the lawn in 20 minutes (since 40 minutes for the whole lawn divided by 2).

Adding these times together:
- 30 minutes (slower speed) + 20 minutes (faster speed) = 50 minutes.

So, it took him 50 minutes to mow the whole lawn."

30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

So, they have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late."
"Catherine buys some fruits at the grocery store. She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4, 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, and 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo. Let's calculate the total cost.

For apples:
1 kilo of apples costs $4.

For bananas:
2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo means 2 * $2 = $4.

For oranges:
2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo means 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
$4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."

"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We know there is one set of twins and one set of triplets. One of the twins is 7 years older than one of the triplets. Their combined ages add up to 44.

Let's say the age of one of the triplets is \( T \) and the age of one of the twins is \( W \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Now, let's use these to find the ages.

If \( W = T + 7 \), we can substitute \( W \) in the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = \frac{37}{2} \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, we know the age of one of the triplets is 18.5. So, the age of one of the twins is:
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

The answer is 100 minutes."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 4 candies cost $3.20. So, the cost of 1 candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
So, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we know that each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong each month. So, Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Now, let's calculate how many coins they save in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins in 10 years.

So, the answer is 5760."
"John takes his dog to the vet. The dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. John brings $125 with him.

First, we calculate the cost of the vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
\[ 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brings $125, so the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Sure, let's figure out the cost of a crate of fruit.

1. **Bananas:**
   - One banana costs twice as much as one apple.
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - So, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = 1\) dollar.
   - There are 5 bananas in a crate.
   - The total cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1 = 5\) dollars.

2. **Apples:**
   - One apple costs $0.5.
   - There are 12 apples in a crate.
   - The total cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) dollars.

3. **Oranges:**
   - Oranges cost three times as much as a banana.
   - One banana costs $1.
   - So, one orange costs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) dollars.
   - There are 7 oranges in a crate.
   - The total cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3 = 21\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges.
   - Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \(5 + 6 + 21 = 32\) dollars.

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. We know there are 14 red squares.
2. The number of blue squares is 4 more than the red squares, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
3. The number of green squares is 6 more than the blue squares, so that's 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
4. The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the green squares, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Now, let's add them all up:
14 (red) + 18 (blue) + 24 (green) + 12 (white) = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

So, the answer is:

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know there are 8 high chairs and the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, if there are 8 high chairs, then the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we add the high chairs and regular chairs to find out how many chairs are currently available:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

Next, we need to find out how many chairs are needed. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of chairs needed is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the number of chairs needed:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get \(\boxed{9}\) more chairs."

\[ 50 \times \frac{50}{100} = 50 \times 0.5 = 25 \]
So, there are 25 bucks.

Next, we know that 20 percent of these bucks are 8 points. So, we need to find out how many of these 25 bucks are 8 points:
\[ 25 \times \frac{20}{100} = 25 \times 0.2 = 5 \]
So, there are 5 eight-point bucks.

Therefore, the answer is 5."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Adam has 50 points.
Betty has 30% more than Adam, so that's 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so that's 65 - 30 = 35 points.
Marta has 3 times as many points as Tom, so that's 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Tom: 35
Marta: 105

Total points = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. So, they are missing:
400 - 255 = 145 points.

The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip."
"Great Grandma Jones has three children. Each of her children has three children of their own, which are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren. Each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, which are Great Grandma Jones' great-grandbabies. To find out how many great-grandbabies will be there, we need to do some counting.

First, we count the grandchildren. Since Great Grandma Jones has three children and each child has three grandchildren, we have:
\[ 3 \text{ children} \times 3 \text{ grandchildren per child} = 9 \text{ grandchildren} \]

Next, we count the great-grandbabies. Since each of the 9 grandchildren has three great-grandbabies, we have:
\[ 9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ great-grandbabies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies} \]

So, the number of great-grandbabies at the family reunion is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, Greta's paycheck is $2400. She puts 50% of it into her retirement account. So, we calculate 50% of $2400:

\[ 2400 \times 0.50 = 1200 \]

This means she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. So, we calculate 20% of $2400:

\[ 2400 \times 0.20 = 480 \]

This means she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amounts she spent from her total paycheck:

Answer: 8 pairs"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many fireworks the city is setting off. They have 15 boxes, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, we multiply 15 by 20:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]
So, the city is setting off 300 fireworks.

Hannah can see 40% of these fireworks. To find out how many that is, we take 40% of 300:
\[ 300 \times 0.40 = 120 \]
So, Hannah will see 120 fireworks from the city.

Next, Hannah is setting off her own fireworks. She has 3 boxes, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, we multiply 3 by 5:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
So, Hannah is setting off 15 fireworks.

Now, to find out the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we add the fireworks she sees from the city to the fireworks she sets off:
\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is:
\[ 135 \]"
"Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet 7 more friends, so in total, there are 20 people. Each person gets a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. So, we need 20 drinks and 60 snacks. Drinks cost $2 each, so 20 drinks cost $40. Snacks also cost $2 each, so 60 snacks cost $120. Adding the cost of drinks and snacks together, we get $40 + $120 = $160. So, the group has spent $160 on drinks and snacks. The answer is \boxed{160}."
"Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so that's 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds. When Gary joins, the three trucks together can carry 11,600 pounds. So, if we add Gissela's and Gordy's capacities, we get 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract 8,800 from 11,600, which gives us 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 6 females and each ate 3 dumplings. So, the total dumplings eaten by females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, there are 8 males, and each ate 1 more dumpling than the females, so each male ate 4 dumplings. The total dumplings eaten by males is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Now, to find the total number of dumplings cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by females and males:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 50."
"Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. First, we need to find out how much each part of the ratio is worth. Since the total parts are 5 (3 + 2), each part is worth $100 ÷ 5 = $20. 

Gerald's share is 3 parts, so he got 3 × $20 = $60. If Gerald spent $10 on a book, he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.

So, the answer is $50."
"The cat runs at 15 feet per second and is 5 times faster than the turtle. So, the turtle's speed is 15 divided by 5, which is 3 feet per second. If the turtle crawls for 40 seconds, it will cover 3 feet per second times 40 seconds, which equals 120 feet. So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The correct answer is: 120 feet."
"The firefighters are trying to raise $6300. After 3 hours, they have $2100. To find out how much more they need, we subtract $2100 from $6300:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

So, they need $4200 more. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so each hour they raise:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

This means they raise $700 each hour. To find out how many more hours they need to raise $4200, we divide $4200 by $700:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need 6 more hours to reach their goal. Adding the initial 3 hours to the 6 hours gives:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"The city uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of that, 80% is used for industrial purposes. To find out how much is used for non-industrial purposes, we first calculate the industrial usage:

\[ 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

So, 32% of the river's water is used for industrial purposes. Now, to find the non-industrial usage, we subtract the industrial usage from the total city usage:

\[ 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Therefore, the city uses 8% of the river's total water for non-industrial purposes. The correct answer is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

First, we need to know how many days are in 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks would be:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Alex charges for 14 days of tutoring. If she charges $12 per day, then for 14 days, the charge would be:
\[ 14 \times 12 = 168 \]

So, the amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much chocolate ice cream is made in one hour. The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how much vanilla ice cream is made in one hour. The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how much ice cream is made in 48 hours. For chocolate ice cream:
\[ 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \]

For vanilla ice cream:
\[ 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \]

Finally, we add the two amounts together to get the total:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

So, the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is:
\[ \boxed{3000} \]"
"Okay, let's do this step by step.

First, Marcus bought 5 croissants at $3.00 each. So, that's 5 times $3.00, which is $15.00.

Next, he bought 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each. So, that's 4 times $2.50, which is $10.00.

Then, he bought 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each. So, that's 3 times $4.00, which is $12.00.

Lastly, he bought 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each. So, that's 13 times $1.00, which is $13.00.

Now, let's add all these up: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off. So, he gets 10% off $50.00. That means he pays 90% of $50.00. 

To find 90% of $50.00, we can do $50.00 times 0.90, which is $45.00.

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.

The final answer is: $45.00."
"Erin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream. The ice cream parlor is offering a deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's see how much it costs to buy 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
2 scoops cost $1.50 each, so 2 scoops cost $3.00. The third scoop is free.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
$6.00 divided by $3.00 per set is 2 sets.

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
2 sets times 3 scoops per set equals 6 scoops.

So, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

**Final Answer: 6**"
"Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's figure out how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces in two weeks.

Now, let's figure out how much candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- So, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces in two weeks.

Next, we need to find out how much candy each has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we need to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- So, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The answer is:

"Mr. Boarden is remodeling his bathroom. He needs 24 tiles for every square foot. His bathroom is 36 square feet, but he only wants to cover two thirds of it. So, first, we find out how much area he wants to cover:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \, \text{square feet} \]

Now, since he needs 24 tiles for each square foot, we multiply the area he wants to cover by the number of tiles per square foot:

\[ 24 \, \text{square feet} \times 24 \, \text{tiles per square foot} = 576 \, \text{tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden needs 576 tiles."
"James went to pick blueberries. It cost him $20 to go picking and then $1.5 for each pound. He picked 30 pounds. To find out how much he saved, we need to calculate the total cost of picking and compare it to the cost of buying the same amount at the store.

First, let's find out the total cost of picking:
- Initial cost: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Pounds picked: 30

Total cost of picking = $20 + ($1.5 × 30) = $20 + $45 = $65

Next, let's find out the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:
- Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
- Pounds picked: 30

Total cost at the store = $2.5 × 30 = $75

Now, let's find out how much he saved:
- Total cost at the store: $75
- Total cost of picking: $65

Savings = $75 - $65 = $10

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries instead of buying them at the store."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, and it increased by 10%. To find 10% of $700, we do:
\[ 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 500 computers at this new price. We do this by multiplying the new price by the number of computers:
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs. John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories. So, the total calories from the eggs are:
\[ 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the calories from the cheese. John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce has 120 calories. So, the total calories from the cheese are:
\[ 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories} \]

Then, we calculate the calories from the ham. John uses 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce has 40 calories. So, the total calories from the ham are:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add up all the calories:
\[ 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is:
\[ 770 \text{ calories} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 6 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $0.50, so for 6 pencils:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, we need to find out how much 8 erasers cost. Each eraser costs $0.25, so for 8 erasers:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers together:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10, so the change you would get is:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is:

"Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week. Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal. To find out how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, we need to add the boxes she bought this week and then subtract the number of boxes she bought last week.

This week, she bought:
- 3 boxes of Coco Crunch
- 5 boxes of Fruit Loops

So, the total number of boxes bought this week is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Last week, she bought:
- 4 boxes of cereal

"Helga is a clog dancer in Slovenia. When her arms are down, she can tap her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute. When her arms are raised, the tap rate for each foot slows to 200 times per minute. She dances for 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes and down for the other 3 minutes.

First, let's calculate the taps for each foot when her arms are down:
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the taps for each foot when her arms are raised:
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we add the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

So, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"Ron has a pothole in front of his house. If the city doesn't fix it, it will cost him $450 to fix his car. But if he tries to fix it himself, the city will fine him $120 and he will need to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.

First, let's figure out how much it will cost Ron if he fixes it himself:
- Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75
- Fine for fixing the road without permission: $120
- Total cost: $75 + $120 = $195

Now, let's see how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself:
- Potential damage to his car: $450
- Cost of fixing the pothole himself: $195
- Savings: $450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we start with the normal chairs. There are 170 normal chairs, and 20 of them were sent for repair. So, we subtract 20 from 170:
\[ 170 - 20 = 150 \]
So, there are 150 normal chairs left.

Next, we look at the baby chairs. There are 23 baby chairs, and 13 of them were sent for repair. So, we subtract 13 from 23:
\[ 23 - 13 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 baby chairs left.

Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs together:
\[ 150 + 10 = 160 \]

So, the total number of chairs left is 160.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 5 friends, and each ordered one pizza. Each pizza has 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we need to find out how many slices were eaten. Bryce and two of his friends each ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. So, each of these three friends ate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

The other two friends each ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. So, each of these two friends ate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"A cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. A dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of 30 minutes, which is 20 minutes. To find the average time, we add the times together and divide by 2:

\]

So, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. First, we need to convert that to inches. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 8 feet is 8 times 12, which is 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get 100 inches for Topher's shoe.

The problem says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. So, if we let Bobby's shoe length be \( x \) inches, then we can write the equation as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long. The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many windows are in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we need to find out how many windows are in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows, so:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows smashed in both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to count all the spools Candy has:
- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45
- Light green: 40
- Dark green: 50

So, the total number of spools is:
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue:
- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45

So, the total number of blue spools is:
15 + 45 = 60

Now, to find out what percent of the spools are blue, we use this formula:
( Number of blue spools / Total number of spools ) × 100

So, it would be:
( 60 / 150 ) × 100 = 0.4 × 100 = 40%

So, 40% of the spools are blue.

The answer is 40%."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. **Total people at the start**: 5000

2. **People who voted by midday (12:00)**:

3. **Remaining people after midday**:
   - \(5000 - 2000 = 3000\)

4. **People who voted by 16:00**:
   - \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining 3000 voted.
   - \(3000 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2000\)

5. **Remaining people who had not voted by 16:00**:
   - \(3000 - 2000 = 1000\)

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \(\boxed{1000}\)."
"Parker chews 4 pieces of gum every day. A pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs for 30 days, first, we need to know how many pieces he will use in 30 days. 

He uses 4 pieces a day, so in 30 days, he will use:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packs of 15 pieces each he needs for 120 pieces. We do this by dividing the total pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many smores each sleeve of graham crackers can make. Each sleeve makes 8 smores.

Next, we need to find out how many smores are needed for the kids. There are 9 kids, and each wants 2 smores. So, the total number of smores for the kids is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Now, for the adults. There are 6 adults, and each will eat 1 smore. So, the total number of smores for the adults is:
\[ 6 \times 1 = 6 \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of smores needed:
\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \]

Each box of graham crackers contains 3 sleeves. Since each sleeve makes 8 smores, each box can make:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, to make 24 smores, we need 1 box of graham crackers.

The answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Dora is 15 years old. Her father's age is 8 more than twice Dora's age. So, her father's age is \(2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38\). Dora's mother is 4 years younger than her father, so her mother's age is \(38 - 4 = 34\). The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \(15 + 38 + 34 = 87\).

So, the total combined age is 87."

- Math books: 2 pounds each, and she has 2 of them, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.
- Science books: 2 pounds each, and she has 2 of them, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: twice the weight of the English book, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 pounds.

Now, let's add all these together:

So, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is 21 pounds."
"Candidate A got 20 votes because 20% of 100 is 20. Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A, so that's 20 plus half of 20, which is 30. So Candidate B got 30 votes. That means Candidate C got the rest. If we add up the votes for A and B, we get 20 plus 30, which is 50. So Candidate C got 100 minus 50, which is 50 votes.

The answer is 50."
"Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris will have 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck will have 77 + 10 = 87 apples. Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples: 90 - 87 = 3. So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces of water. He can make giant cubes that use 4 ounces each, medium cubes that use 2 ounces each, and small cubes that use 0.5 ounces each. He makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes.

First, let's see how much water the giant cubes use:
3 giant cubes × 4 ounces each = 12 ounces

Next, the medium cubes:
7 medium cubes × 2 ounces each = 14 ounces

And the small cubes:
8 small cubes × 0.5 ounces each = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up all the water used:
12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 30 ounces

Peter started with 32 ounces, so the water left is:
32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces

So, the answer is 2 ounces."

We know there are 50 students in total. Some of them like to bake, some like to play basketball, and the rest like to play video games or music.

First, let's see how many students like to bake and play basketball:
- Students who like to bake: 10
- Students who like to play basketball: 5

Now, we need to find out how many students like to play music. The problem says the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. So:
- Students who like to play music: 2 × 5 = 10

Next, we add up the students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:
- Total: 10 (baking) + 5 (basketball) + 10 (music) = 25

Finally, we subtract this total from the total number of students to find out how many like to play video games:
- Students who like to play video games: 50 (total students) - 25 (baking, basketball, music) = 25

So, the number of students who like to play video games is:

Answer: 28"
"In a school, there are two classes with a total of 80 students. Each class has the same number of students. So, we divide 80 by 2 to find out how many students are in each class.

80 ÷ 2 = 40

So, each class has 40 students. Now, 40% of the students in each class are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40.

40% of 40 = 0.40 × 40 = 16

So, there are 16 girls in each class. To find out how many boys are in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.

40 - 16 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class."

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day."
"Mark bought 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each. So, the total cost is:

\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \]

He got 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 more cards each worth $50. The total value of the 30 cards is:

\[ 30 \times 50 = 1500 \]

Adding the value of all the cards together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \]

To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \]

So, the profit Mark made is:

\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Sure, let's figure out how much money Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- Each adult pays $26, so for 2 adults, it's \(26 \times 2 = 52\) dollars.
- Each child pays $12, so for 2 children, it's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.
- Total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\) dollars.

For the second amusement park:
- Each adult pays $14, so for 2 adults, it's \(14 \times 2 = 28\) dollars.
- Each child pays $10, so for 2 children, it's \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars.
- Total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\) dollars.

To find out how much they can save:
- Savings = Cost of first amusement park - Cost of second amusement park
- Savings = \(76 - 48 = 28\) dollars.

So, they can save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park."
"The tomato vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each but now he can buy them for $0.4 each. He sells 500 tomatoes a day. 

First, we find out how much he saves per tomato:
$0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1

Then, we calculate how much he saves per day:
$0.1 * 500 = $50

Since there are 7 days in a week, we find out how much he saves in a week:
$50 * 7 = $350

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Sean has 56 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so we multiply 56 by 4:

\[ 56 \times 4 = 224 \]

So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Next, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. So, to find out how many marbles Cal has, we multiply 56 by 2:

\[ 56 \times 2 = 112 \]

So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{336} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have 54 students and we need to make 12 groups. First, we need to find out how many students would be in each group if we make 12 groups. We do this by dividing 54 by 12:

\[ 54 \div 12 = 4.5 \]

This means each group would have 4.5 students. But we already have 6 groups, so we need to find out how many more groups we need to make 12 groups in total. We subtract the 6 groups we already have from the 12 groups we need:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

So, we need 6 more groups. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Candy rents chairs. During the weekdays, she rents 60 chairs each day. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in one week, she rents \(60 \times 5 = 300\) chairs. For a 4-week month, she rents \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) chairs during weekdays.

On weekends, she rents 100 chairs each day. There are 2 weekend days in a week, so in one week, she rents \(100 \times 2 = 200\) chairs. For a 4-week month, she rents \(200 \times 4 = 800\) chairs during weekends.

So, in one 4-week month, she rents a total of \(1200 + 800 = 2000\) chairs.

For two 4-week months, she rents \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\) chairs.

The total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months is 4000."
"Gunther started with 48 bananas. Arnold took half of them, so that's 24 bananas. Now Gunther had 24 bananas left. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas, making it 49. Arnold then took 12 bananas, leaving Gunther with 37. On the third day, Gunther added 6 more bananas, so now he has 43 bananas.

The final number of bananas Gunther has is 43."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know the total electricity bill each month is $100. There are 5 people sharing this bill equally, including Jenna and her 4 roommates. So, we need to divide $100 by 5 to find out how much each person pays monthly.

\[ \text{Monthly share} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much each person pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12.

\[ \text{Annual share} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."
"Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. That means he sent 8 times 12 glasses and 4 times 12 plates. So, 8 times 12 is 96 glasses and 4 times 12 is 48 plates. When they were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, he now has 96 minus 10 glasses and 48 minus 6 plates. That means he has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.

So, the answer is 86 glasses and 42 plates."
"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which means she trades 27 small stickers (90% of 30). Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which means she trades 20 large stickers (50% of 40). Each large sticker is worth one large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 20 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets 60 small buttons from the remaining large stickers.

Adding all the buttons together, she has 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

So, the answer is 107 buttons."
"Joey played football last week. On Monday, he played 2 matches. On Friday, he played 1 match. On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is 4 matches. So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is:

2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

The answer is 7."
"Sure, let's figure this out together. We know there are 33 people on the council. The regulation passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. 

Let's say the number of votes against is \( x \). Then the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \). The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is 33. So we can write it as:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against is 11. Since the number of votes in favor is twice that, it would be:

\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - So, 2 times 11 is 22.

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - So, 22 minus 4 is 18.

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - So, half of 18 is 9.

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - So, 9 plus 6 is 15.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Extra-Small: 11
- Small: 22
- Medium: 18
- Large: 9
- Extra-Large: 15

Adding these together: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.

**Final Answer: 75**"
"Sure, let's figure out the final price after the discount.

First, we need to find out how much the discount is. The bag is marked at $140 and there's a 5% discount. To find 5% of $140, we do:

\[ 140 \times \frac{5}{100} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

So, the discount is $7. Now, we subtract this discount from the original price:

\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, after the discount, you will pay $133.

The final answer is \(\boxed{133}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that each playlist has 300 songs. John has 20 playlists, so we need to find out how many songs that is in total. We do this by multiplying the number of songs in one playlist by the number of playlists:

\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. To find out how many hours all the songs will last, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:

\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we find out how many people think horse #2 will win. Since 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we calculate:
   20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

2. Now, we have 50 - 10 = 40 people left.

3. Next, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. So we calculate:
   60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

4. Finally, to find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we subtract the people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total:
   50 - 10 - 24 = 16 people

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.

The answer is 16."
"Okay, let's think this through step by step.

First, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, if one third is 6, then the total number of Pomeranians would be 6 times 3, which is 18.

Next, we know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. If 18 Pomeranians are two thirds of the total puppies, then to find the total number of puppies, we need to figure out what one third is and then multiply by 3. 

Since 18 is two thirds, one third would be 18 divided by 2, which is 9. So, the total number of puppies would be 9 times 3, which is 27.

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

The answer is: 27."
"Jayden had $70. His sister Ava gave him half of her $90, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so Jayden needs $200 - $115 = $85 more to buy the camera. The answer is $85."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know that the three houses together need 250 cases of shingles. Let's say the first house needs \( x \) cases. Then, the second house needs \( 2x \) cases, and the third house needs \( 2x \) cases too.

So, if we add them up, we get:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

Now, the third house needs \( 2x \) cases, so:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."
"Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each, so she spent 3 * $2 = $6. Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each, so he spent 5 * $1 = $5. Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3, so he spent $3. Together, they spent $6 + $5 + $3 = $14. 

So, the total amount they spent is $14."
"George has 45% more pears than bananas. He has 200 bananas. To find out how many pears he has, we need to calculate 45% of 200 and add it to 200.

45% of 200 is:
45/100 * 200 = 90

So, George has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the pears and bananas together:
290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits

So, George has 490 fruits in total."
"Marissa had $80 and she bought a ball for $20. So, the money she had left is $80 - $20 = $60. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she could buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar. So, $60 ÷ $5 = 12. Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy. The answer is 12."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. So, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 20 kilograms of oranges. The cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is $60. So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice."
"Ezra read 300 books and then decided to read 150 more, so he read a total of:
300 + 150 = 450 books.

Ahmed read half as many books as Ezra, so he read:

Together, they read:
450 + 150 = 600 books.

So, the total number of books they read altogether is 600."
"Tanya teaches at school. She earns $15 for every hour and an extra $5 if she teaches more than 3 classes in a day. On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours, and on Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.

For Monday:
- She teaches for 5 hours, so she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5.
- So, her total for Monday is \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

For Wednesday:
- She teaches for 2 hours, so she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not get the extra $5.
- So, her total for Wednesday is $30.

Adding her earnings from both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30
- Total: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

So, Tanya earned a total of $110 for these two days of teaching."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many vanilla scents were sold. They sold 5 of each of the 4 vanilla scents, so:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
So, 20 vanilla scents were sold.

Next, we need to find out how many fruity scents were sold. They sold 2 of each of the 8 fruity scents, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]
So, 16 fruity scents were sold.

Now, we need to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents. We do this by subtracting the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.

The answer is 10 pencils."
"Jack drives to the museum and back. The museum is 150 miles away, and he drives at 75 miles per hour. 

To find out how long it takes to get to the museum, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, for the trip to the museum:
\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

The trip back home is the same distance and speed, so it also takes 2 hours.

He spends 6 hours at the museum.

So, the total time he is gone is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (to the museum)} + 2 \text{ hours (back home)} + 6 \text{ hours (at the museum)} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the answer is 10 hours."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mike has 600 movies.
2. A third of the movies are in series, so that's 600 divided by 3, which is 200 movies.
3. Each series movie costs $6, so 200 movies times $6 is $1200.
4. The remaining movies are 600 minus 200, which is 400 movies.
5. 40% of these 400 movies are older movies, so that's 400 times 0.4, which is 160 movies.
6. Each older movie costs $5, so 160 movies times $5 is $800.
7. The rest of the movies are normal movies, so that's 400 minus 160, which is 240 movies.
8. Each normal movie costs $10, so 240 movies times $10 is $2400.
9. Adding all these up: $1200 (series) + $800 (older) + $2400 (normal) = $4400.

So, the total cost is $4400.

The answer is: \boxed{4400}"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, they drove for 4.5 hours at 50 miles per hour. So, the distance they drove is:
\[ 4.5 \times 50 = 225 \text{ miles} \]

Next, they hiked for 1.5 hours. Their hiking speed is half of their driving speed minus 5 miles per hour. So, their hiking speed is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \]
The distance they hiked is:
\[ 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the driving distance and the hiking distance to get the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ 225 + 30 = 255 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance to the vacation spot is:

"Ava and Emma are playing a video game. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries. But Emma finishes the level 4 seconds faster than Ava. 

For each enemy jumped on, they get 10 points. For each berry collected, they get 5 points. For each second left on the timer, they get 30 points.

Let's say Emma jumps on \(E_e\) enemies and collects \(E_b\) berries, and finishes with \(E_t\) seconds left on the timer. 

Ava jumps on \(E_e + 8\) enemies and collects \(E_b + 3\) berries, and finishes with \(E_t + 4\) seconds left on the timer.

Emma's score is:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of $64. Two of the pizzas cost $30. So, we need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost.

We start by subtracting the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost:
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

This means the other two pizzas together cost $34. Since both of these pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2:
\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas costs $17.

The final answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, so that's:
3 rides/day × 5 days = 15 rides

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much, so that's:
2 × 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day
And for 2 days, that's:
6 rides/day × 2 days = 12 rides

So, in total, they ride:
15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides

The answer is 27 rides a week."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He bought some more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's say he bought \(O\) orange fish and \(W\) white fish. So, after buying, he has \(3 + O\) orange fish and \(4 + W\) white fish. The problem says he now has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so we can write this as:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Now, let's solve this. First, we expand the right side:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Next, we move the numbers to one side and the variables to the other:

\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish he bought is 17, so:

\[O + W = 17\]

Now, we can solve these two equations. From the second equation, we can say:

\[O = 17 - W\]

We substitute this into the first equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. The correct answer is:

\[\boxed{4}\]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Andy drives 5 miles one way to work. So, a round trip is 10 miles each day. He works 5 days a week, so the total distance he drives in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles.

Next, his car uses 10 miles per gallon of gas. So, to drive 50 miles, he needs 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons of gas.

The gas costs $3 per gallon, so for 5 gallons, he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week."
"Carrie got ten twenties and 140 quarters from her aunt. 

First, let's figure out how much money she got from the twenties. Ten twenties would be:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's find out how much she got from the quarters. Since each quarter is worth 25 cents, 140 quarters would be:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie got is:
\[ 200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Carrie spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties and all the quarters. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount spent on the quarters is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ 120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"Ricardo grows tomatoes and eggplants. Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants. He planted 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants. To find out how many fruits he gets, we need to do some simple math.

For tomatoes:
\[ 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} \times 5 \text{ plants} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} \]

For eggplants:
\[ 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} \times 8 \text{ plants} = 32 \text{ eggplants} \]

Now, we add the tomatoes and eggplants together:
\[ 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo gets is:

"Samwell sold a total of 40 TVs this week. One-fourth of these sales are smart TVs, so that's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 smart TVs. One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so that's 40 divided by 8, which is 5 analog TVs. To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart and analog TVs from the total. So, 40 minus 10 minus 5 equals 25. Therefore, they sold 25 OLED TVs."
"John is trying to raise money for a school trip. The school will cover half of the trip cost, which is $300. So, the school will give $150. John has $50. To find out how much more John needs, we add what the school will give and what John has, which is $50 + $150 = $200. The total cost of the trip is $300, so the amount John still needs is $300 - $200 = $100.

The answer is $100."
"Carson needs to keep the house warm to prevent the pipes from freezing. If it's 45 degrees during the day and 33 degrees colder at night, then the night temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees. The pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 to 32 degrees. That's a difference of 32 - 12 = 20 degrees. Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees, so Carson needs 20 / 5 = 4 logs to keep the house warm. 

So, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many groups of 9 people can be made from 90 people. We do this by dividing 90 by 9:

\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 groups.

Next, we need to figure out how many of these groups brought back seashells. The problem says that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

This means 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each group brought:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
\[ 172 - 47 = 125 \]

Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
\[ 125 + 13 = 138 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
\[ 138 - 38 = 100 \]

So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is 100.

The final answer is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day on his way home. Each bottle cap is worth 25 cents. So, every day he finds 10 bottle caps, which means he gets 10 times 25 cents. That's 250 cents, or $2.50 each day. In a month with 30 days, he would find bottle caps worth 2.50 times 30. That's 75 dollars. So, the answer is $75.00."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, Jamie works 8 hours a day at $20 per hour. So, for 8 hours, she earns:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

On Tuesday, she worked 11 hours. That means she worked 3 extra hours beyond her regular 8 hours. For these extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular rate. So, her extra rate is:
\[ 150\% \times 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For the 3 extra hours, she earns:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add her regular pay and her extra pay to find out how much she earned in total:
\[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."
"Okay, let's count the lions together. We have 12 female lions, then half as many male lions, which means 6 male lions, and 14 lion cubs. So, we add them all up:

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (cubs) = 32 lions

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"Mike wanted to buy a pair of jeans that were on sale for 25% off. The jeans originally cost $40. To find out how much the jeans cost after the discount, we need to calculate 25% of $40 and then subtract that from the original price.

First, let's find 25% of $40:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

The jeans now cost $30. Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we need to find out how much money he will have left over:
\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Mike will have $20 left over."
"The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, that's 20 employees/month * 3 months = 60 new employees. Adding these to the initial 200 employees gives a total of 200 + 60 = 260 employees. Each employee gets paid $4000 per month, so for 260 employees, the monthly salary is 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000. For three months, the total salary is $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3,120,000."
The choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds.
"Billy started with $10 per hour. After 2 months, he got a raise to $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he got another raise to $11.50 per hour. Sally started with $10.50 per hour, which is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate.

Billy works 20 hours, so he earns:
\[ 20 \times 11.50 = 230 \text{ dollars} \]

Sally works 20 hours, so she earns:
\[ 20 \times 10.50 = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

Billy earns $230 and Sally earns $210, so Billy earns:
\[ 230 - 210 = 20 \text{ dollars more} \]

The answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Each loaf costs $2, so for 3 loaves, it would be:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
So, 3 loaves of bread cost $6.

Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so for 2 bagels, it would be:
\[ 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
So, 2 bagels cost $2.

Now, we need to find out how much more the bread costs than the bagels. We do this by subtracting the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]
So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

The final answer is:
\[ \$4 \]"
"Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's points. Half of Pierson's points is 139, so Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points. Adding Pierson's and Nikita's points together, we get 278 + 150 = 428 points. So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many students there are in total. There are 40 classes, and each class has 25 students. So, the total number of students is:
\[ 40 \times 25 = 1000 \]

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \]

Next, we need to find out how many teachers there are. There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers. So, the total number of teachers is:
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \times 2 = 240 \]

Now, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers to get the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 + 240 = 1240 \]

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[ \boxed{1240} \]"
"Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. That's a total of 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals. She wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. So, if we let the number of stuffed goats be \( x \), then the total number of stuffed animals will be 14 + \( x \). We want \( x \) to be 30% of 14 + \( x \).

So, we set up the equation:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Now, let's solve it:
\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement by playing a total of 30 hours. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks and then for 2 hours every day for a week. Let's figure out how many hours she still needs to play.

First, she plays half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so she plays:
\[ 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, she plays 2 hours every day for a week. There are 7 days in a week, so she plays:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours she has already played:
\[ 7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the hours she still needs to play are:
\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have two cars on a highway. The first car is going 60 miles per hour, and the second car is going 70 miles per hour. We need to find out how far apart they will be after 2 hours.

First, let's figure out how far the first car travels in 2 hours:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's figure out how far the second car travels in 2 hours:
\[ 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between the distances they have traveled:
\[ 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The answer is:

"James bought a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond cost $600 and the gold cost $300. He had to pay an extra 30% for it to be made into a ring.

First, we add the cost of the diamond and the gold:
\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

Next, we calculate the 30% premium:
\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

Now, we add the premium to the total cost of the materials:
\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

So, James paid:
\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many students passed in each grade.

- For third-graders, 340 out of 500 passed.
- For fourth-graders, 40 out of 100 passed.
- For fifth-graders, the pass rate is twice that of the fourth-graders. Since 40 out of 100 is 40%, twice that is 80%. So, 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed, which is 320.

Now, let's add up the total number of students who passed:
- Third-graders: 340
- Fourth-graders: 40
- Fifth-graders: 320
So, 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students passed.

Next, we need to know the total number of students:
- Third-graders: 500
- Fourth-graders: 100
- Fifth-graders: 400
So, 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students in total.

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students:
700 / 1000 = 0.7, which is 70%.

So, the overall pass rate is 70%.

**Final Answer: 70%**"
"Milo is making a mosaic with glass chips. He needs 12 chips for every square inch. A bag has 72 chips, and he has 2 bags. So, he has 72 chips times 2, which is 144 chips. 

To find out how many square inches he can make, we divide the total chips by the chips needed per square inch. So, 144 chips divided by 12 chips per square inch equals 12 square inches.

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length, we divide the total square inches by the height. So, 12 square inches divided by 3 inches equals 4 inches.

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is 4 inches."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much tea the students drank. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Then, sixteen students each drank 2 quarts, so:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Now, we add the tea that the students drank:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

There are 10 quarts of tea left, so the total amount of tea at the beginning was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To find out how many gallons that is, we know that 1 gallon is equal to 4 quarts. So:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons.

The answer is: \boxed{12}"
"Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. Then he ordered 100 more. So, he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies. He has already sold 150, so he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

"At the start of the year, there are 10 students. Each month, the number of students doubles. So, let's count the students at the end of each month:

- **End of January**: 10 students become 20 students.
- **End of February**: 20 students become 40 students.
- **End of March**: 40 students become 80 students.
- **End of April**: 80 students become 160 students.
- **End of May**: 160 students become 320 students.

To find out how many more students joined by the end of May, we subtract the number of students at the start from the number at the end of May:

320 - 10 = 310

So, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

"Felix climbs trees to help kids get things out. He charges 25 cents for each branch he climbs. In one week, he made $105. To find out how many branches he climbed, we need to divide $105 by $0.25. 

$105 ÷ $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total branches by 7 to find the average branches he climbs each day.

420 branches ÷ 7 days = 60 branches per day

So, on average, Felix climbs 60 branches per day.

The answer is: 60"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. That's \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. That's \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. That's \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. That's \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, let's add all these petals together:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\]

But then, she drops 1 of each type of flower. So, she loses:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\]

So, the total number of petals left in the vase is:
\[101 - 22 = 79\]

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows. They each made 9 S'mores, so together they used:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used or dropped is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original number of marshmallows was 35. After using 21, the number left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows can be used to make 14 S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how long each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes.
- Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for 10 minutes.
- One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for 30 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many quarters each person can use in 4 hours (240 minutes):
- Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
- Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
- The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

Now, we add up all the quarters:
- Jack: 12 quarters
- Two friends: 48 quarters
- Better friend: 8 quarters
- Total: \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\) quarters

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total cost is:
- \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars

So, the total money used is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Tanya is making a salt scrub and she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. She also uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as citrus zest. The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces.

Let's say the amount of citrus zest is \( z \) ounces. Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the fragrance is also \( z \) ounces. The amount of salt is \( s \) ounces, and since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the sugar is also \( s \) ounces. The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces because it is twice the amount of salt.

Now, let's add up all the ingredients:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
We can divide the whole equation by 2:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

Since \( z \) is the same as the amount of citrus zest and we know the total is 10 ounces, we can find out how much oil she uses. If we assume \( s = 1 \) ounce, then:
\[ z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \]
So, the amount of oil, which is \( 2s \), is:
\[ 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. Let's figure out how much he spent.

For the goats:
3 goats × $500 each = $1500

For the cows:
2 cows × $1500 each = $3000

Now, let's add the cost of the goats and the cows together:
$1500 + $3000 = $4500

So, John spent $4500 in total.

The answer is: $4500."
"Paul needs 63 cupcakes for the party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. That's 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes he already has. So, he needs to buy 63 - 48 = 15 more cupcakes. The answer is 15."
"Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Robert has 20 cars, so Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, he sells:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

He gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars Joe gives away and sells is:

\[ 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Joe started with 40 cars and gave away and sold 24 cars, so he has:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

The final number of cars Joe has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. The charity raised a total of $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 came from organizations. So, the rest must have come from the students. We can find out how much the students raised by subtracting the amount from organizations from the total amount raised:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

So, the students raised $125,000 in total. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250."
"Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked for half of that, which is 4 hours. So, in total, she walked for 8 + 4 = 12 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 12 by 60 to get the total time in minutes. That is 12 * 60 = 720 minutes. So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes."

"John does 30 cycles of work each day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. To find out how much he makes in a week, we need to do some calculations.

First, we find out how many tasks he does in one day:
30 cycles * 5 tasks = 150 tasks per day.

Next, we find out how many tasks he does in a week:
150 tasks per day * 7 days = 1050 tasks per week.

Now, we calculate his earnings for the week:
1050 tasks * $1.20 per task = $1260.

So, the answer is:

"Sasha played in two games. In the first game, she scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 less than Sasha, so she scored 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, which means she scored 4 points. To find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add her scores from both games: 14 + 4 = 18. So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and each package has 11 tins, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food. She also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins, so that's 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food. To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought, we subtract the tins of dog food from the tins of cat food: 88 - 36 = 52. So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

The answer is 52."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know that the total number of cards is 341. Let's say PJ has \(P\) cards. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

Now, if we add up all the cards, we get:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \(3 \times 47 = 141\) cards. Becca has \(141 + 12 = 153\) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"Cindy went to the park on Easter Sunday and found eggs. She had 5 green eggs. She had twice as many blue eggs as green ones, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 blue eggs. She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so that's 10 minus 1, which is 9 pink eggs. She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 9 divided by 3, which is 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's count all the eggs:
- Green: 5
- Blue: 10
- Pink: 9
- Yellow: 3

So, the total number of eggs is 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.

The answer is 27."
"Milly needs to return a book that weighs 4 pounds and costs $32. She has to send it 20 miles to a distribution center. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's price.

First, let's calculate the shipping cost:
- For the weight: \(4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40\)
- For the distance: \(20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08/\text{mile} = \$1.60\)
- Total shipping cost: \(\$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00\)

Next, let's find out the refund amount:
- Refund is 75% of the book's price: \(32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00\)

Now, let's calculate the net loss:
- Original cost: \$32
- Refund: \$24
- Shipping cost: \$3
- Net loss: \(\$32 - \$24 + \$3 = \$11\)

So, the money Milly will lose is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Mulan starts with $40. Her father gives her $100 more, so she has $40 + $100 = $140. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, so that's 2 * $30 = $60. She also buys a bag for $20. So, she spends $60 + $20 = $80. Now, to find out how much she has left, we subtract what she spent from what she had: $140 - $80 = $60.

"Boris owns a chocolate factory. He makes 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars. In the second week, he makes half as much as the first week, which is 4,000 bars. In the third week, he makes three times as much as the first week, which is 24,000 bars. To find out how much he makes in the fourth week, we need to add up the bars he makes in the first three weeks and subtract that from the total monthly production.

First week: 8,000 bars
Second week: 4,000 bars
Third week: 24,000 bars

Total for first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Total monthly production: 50,000 bars

So, the fourth week production is: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

The answer is 14,000 bars."
"Britany spends time on TikTok in a few different ways. She records videos, writes songs, and does her makeup. Let's add up all the time she spends.

1. **Recording Videos:**
   - She records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - So, in a week, she spends \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes recording videos.
   - In a month with 4 weeks, she spends \(72 \times 4 = 288\) minutes.

2. **Writing Songs:**
   - She spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - 2 hours is the same as 120 minutes.
   - In a month, she spends \(120 \times 4 = 480\) minutes.

3. **Doing Makeup:**
   - She does her makeup for 15 minutes, 6 days a week.
   - So, in a week, she spends \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.
   - In a month, she spends \(90 \times 4 = 360\) minutes.

Now, let's add all the time together:
- Recording videos: 288 minutes
- Writing songs: 480 minutes
- Doing makeup: 360 minutes

Total time in a month: \(288 + 480 + 360 = 1128\) minutes.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month."
"Sure, let's figure out the cost for Angela.

First, the base installation cost is $129.00. This covers 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. We need to find out how many extra items she needs:

- Extra mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- Extra chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
- Extra pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\)

Each extra item costs $15.00. So, the cost for the extra items is:

- Cost for extra mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars
- Cost for extra chandeliers: \(1 \times 15 = 15\) dollars
- Cost for extra pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars

Now, add up the extra costs:

- Total extra cost: \(30 + 15 + 150 = 195\) dollars

Finally, add the base installation cost to the extra cost:

- Total cost: \(129 + 195 = 324\) dollars

So, the total cost for Angela is $324.00."
"Roy has saved 40% more than his brother Anthony. Anthony has saved $10 more than their sister Eva, who has saved $20. So, Anthony has saved $20 + $10 = $30. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, which is 40/100 * $30 = $12. So, Roy has saved $30 + $12 = $42.

The amount of money Roy has is $42."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Pompei**: He can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay**: He can lift 12 times what Pompei can, so that's \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches.
3. **Kagiyami**: He can lift 4 times what Saskay can, so that's \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.
4. **Naruto**: He can lift 10 times what Kagiyami can, so that's \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches.

Now, we need to convert inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so \(480 \div 12 = 40\) feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

The answer is: \(\boxed{40}\)"
"Mason is riding his bike at a speed of 8 miles per hour. He rides for 4 hours, then takes a rest, and rides for another 6 hours. To find out how many miles he has traveled in total, we need to calculate the distance for each part of his ride and then add them together.

For the first part:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

For the second part:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours
- Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances together:
- Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles."
"If three kangaroos, all traveling at the same speed, take 18 hours to cross a highway, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do the same.

First, let's think about the distance. If three kangaroos take 18 hours, the distance they cover is the speed of one kangaroo times 18 hours, then times 3. So, the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \times 3 \]

Now, for the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle is half. If we have four turtles, their combined speed is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{\text{speed of one kangaroo}}{2} = 2 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \]

To find out how long it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{time} = \frac{54 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo}}{2 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo}} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take the four turtles 27 hours to cross the highway."
"Kora made 20 clay dishes. Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 clay dishes. Adding them all up, we get 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 clay dishes. So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140."
"Erika is saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new laptop cost $400. She has some money in her purse, $150 from her part-time job, and $80 from her mom. She still needs $50 more to buy the laptop.

Let's figure out how much money she has in her purse. We know the total amount she needs is $400, and she still needs $50, so she has $350 so far. This $350 comes from her purse, her part-time job, and her mom.

So, if we add up the money from her part-time job and her mom, we get $150 + $80 = $230. This means the money in her purse is $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $120."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many slices Adam gets from the apples he slices. 

- A large apple gives 5 slices. Adam has 3 large apples, so that's \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.
- A small apple gives 3 slices. Adam has 5 small apples, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

Now, we add the slices from the large and small apples together: \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so we subtract that from the total slices he had: \(30 - 15 = 15\).

So, the number of apple slices left is 15.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer gets 5 liters of milk from one cow each day. He has 3 cows, so he gets:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters} \]

He wants to get 25 liters of milk each day. So, he needs:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters} - 15 \, \text{liters} = 10 \, \text{liters} \]

Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to get 25 liters of milk each day.

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much of each glue stick is not used. 

For the first glue stick, it has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, so the unused part is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \]
Since the glue stick is 12 millimeters long, the unused part is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters} \]

For the second glue stick, it has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, so the unused part is:
\[ 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \]
The unused part is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters} \]

For the third glue stick, it has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, so the unused part is:
\[ 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \]
The unused part is:
\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters} \]

Now, we add up all the unused parts:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters} \]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. He has $5000 from working and his brother gave him $200. 

First, we add the cost of the car and the phone:
\[ 10000 + 800 = 10800 \]

Next, we add the money Gabriel has:
\[ 5000 + 200 = 5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money he needs:
\[ 10800 - 5200 = 5600 \]

So, Gabriel still needs $5600."

"Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has 40 dollars in total. He buys six squirt guns at 2 dollars each, so that's 6 times 2, which equals 12 dollars. He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at 3 dollars each, so that's 3 times 3, which equals 9 dollars. The total amount he spends is 12 plus 9, which is 21 dollars. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount spent from the money he had initially. So, 40 minus 21 equals 19 dollars. 

The answer is 19 dollars."
"Jack has 60 dishes. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, he must have 30 socks. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 60 socks. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 30 dishes. 

Now, let's add them up:
- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = 30 + 60 + 60 + 30 = 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. 5 of them are good at math only, 8 of them perform well in English only, and the rest are good at both math and English. To find out how many are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English.

First, we find out how many students are good at both subjects:
20 (total students) - 5 (good at math only) - 8 (good at English only) = 7 (good at both).

Now, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both:
5 (good at math only) + 7 (good at both) = 12.

So, the number of students who are good at math is 12.

The answer is: 12."
"The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. Each group needs 10 minutes (2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit). There's also a 10-minute break in the middle. So, we subtract the 10-minute break from the total time, leaving us with 110 minutes. Now, we divide 110 minutes by 10 minutes per group to find out how many groups can perform. That gives us 11 groups.

So, the answer is 11 groups."
"Brenda invested $300 in a scheme that gives her $225 each year. To find out how much she will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the total interest and add it to the original amount.

Each year, she gets $225, so for 3 years, she will get:
\[ 225 \times 3 = 675 \]

Now, we add this interest to the original $300 she invested:
\[ 300 + 675 = 975 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have $975.

The correct answer is: $975."
"The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, so that's 20 white shirts with collars. This means there are 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts without collars. Twenty of the floral shirts have buttons, so there are 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts without buttons. To find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars, we subtract: 30 - 20 = 10. 

So, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how many trays the farmer needs. Each tray holds 30 eggs, and the farmer has 900 eggs. So, we divide 900 by 30:

\[ 900 \div 30 = 30 \]

This means the farmer needs 30 trays.

Next, we need to find out how much the farmer will earn. Each tray is sold for $2.5. So, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

So, the farmer will earn $75.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much 3 baskets of green food cost. Each basket of green food is $25, so for 3 baskets, it would be:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]

Next, we need to know how much 3 baskets of red food cost after the discount. Each basket of red food is $18, but we get $2 off for each basket, so each basket costs:
\[ 18 - 2 = 16 \]
For 3 baskets, it would be:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the red food together:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \]

So, the total amount you have to pay is:

"To clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we need to do some simple math.

First, we find out how many rooms are in one-half of the motel:
\[ \text{Total rooms} = 90 \]
\[ \text{One-half of the rooms} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes to clean these 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean one room:
\[ \text{Time to clean one room} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

The answer is: 15 hours."

The final answer is 144."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. I am three years younger than my brother. So if my brother is \( B \) years old, I am \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. I am two years older than my sister. So if my sister is \( S \) years old, I am \( S + 2 \) years old. This means \( B - 3 = S + 2 \), so \( S = B - 5 \).
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age. So my mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. The sum of all our ages is 87. So we have \( (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

Now, let's add these up:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6B = 96 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

So my brother is 16 years old. Since I am three years younger than my brother, I am:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, I am \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"Mr. Jackson has 27 students in his class and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. So, first we need to find out how many glue sticks he needs in total. We do this by multiplying the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student will get:

27 students * 2 glue sticks = 54 glue sticks

Now, glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack:

54 glue sticks ÷ 8 glue sticks per pack = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs to make sure he has enough glue sticks for all the students and has some extra. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"

   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day:**
   On the third day, the water increased by 6000 gallons. So, we add:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

On the first day, 10 people are infected. Each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so that's 10 times 6, which is 60 new infections. So, after the first day, the total number of infected people is 10 (initial) plus 60 (new), which equals 70.

On the second day, all 70 infected people from the first day each infect 6 others. So, 70 times 6 equals 420 new infections. Adding these to the 70 already infected, we get 70 plus 420, which is 490.

On the third day, all 490 infected people from the second day each infect 6 others. So, 490 times 6 equals 2940 new infections. Adding these to the 490 already infected, we get 490 plus 2940, which is 3430.

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430.

The answer is 3430."

"Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which is 2 times 3 equals 6 oranges. She also gave 3 oranges to her son. So, she gave away 6 plus 3 equals 9 oranges. Therefore, she remained with 12 minus 9 equals 3 oranges.

Answer: 3"
"Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in a year, she earns 12 badges because there are 12 months in a year.

Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. That means in a year, she earns 6 badges because 12 months divided by 2 is 6.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. So in a year, she earns 36 badges because 12 badges times 3 is 36.

To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract Amber's badges from Wendy's badges. So, 36 badges minus 6 badges is 30 badges.

The answer is 30."
"Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour. She bakes from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. So, she bakes:

\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. So, the total amount raised is:

The answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Gretchen has 70 gold coins. She has 30 fewer silver coins than gold coins, so she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the gold and silver coins together: 70 + 40 = 110. So, Gretchen has 110 coins in total."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 50 students and each student got 10 burritos. So, we calculate the total number of burritos the students ate:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, Mr. George ate 20 burritos. So, we add those to the total:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we know Mr. George ordered 600 burritos in total. To find out how many are left, we subtract the number of burritos eaten from the total number ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. Green cars are 2 fewer than red cars, so that's 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
3. Blue cars are 3 times the number of green cars, so that's 3 × 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars.

The total number of cars is 75. So, to find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total:
75 - 52 = 23.

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know that together Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's say Fawn has \( F \) books. Then Anne has \( F - 12 \) books because Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. And since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has \( (F - 12) + 25 \) books, which simplifies to \( F + 13 \).

Now, we add up all the books:
\[ F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ F + F - 12 + F + 13 = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]

Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books."

Answer: 7 pounds"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs. There are 30 kids, and each kid will have 4 cups. So, we multiply 30 by 4:

\[ 30 \times 4 = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of jello Greg needs. Each 3-ounce box makes 10 cups. So, we divide 120 by 10:

\[ 120 \div 10 = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost. Each box costs $1.25. So, we multiply 12 by $1.25:

\[ 12 \times 1.25 = 15 \]

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello.

The answer is: \boxed{15}"
"The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each, so the total cost is 5 times $700, which is $3500. The seller gave $4000. So, the change the seller will give back is $4000 minus $3500, which is $500.

The answer is $500."
"Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, which is $400 a month. Madeline pays 60% of this, so we need to find out how much that is. 

First, we calculate 60% of $400:
\[ 400 \times 0.60 = 240 \]

This means Madeline pays $240. So, Keenan pays the rest, which is:
\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly cost by 4 to find out how much he pays per week:
\[ 160 \div 4 = 40 \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week."
"Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. 

On the first day, he ate 24 pieces because \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60 is 24.

After the first day, he had 36 pieces left because \( 60 - 24 = 36 \).

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so he had 26 pieces left because \( 36 - 10 = 26 \).

On the third day, he ate 14 pieces because \( \frac{7}{13} \) of 26 is 14.

So, Tobias has eaten a total of 48 pieces of pizza so far. The answer is 48."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00. So, the cost of one bottle of soda is:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that 4 bottles of water cost $8.00. So, the cost of one bottle of water is:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"David has $12.48 and wants to buy 16 bolts from a bin at the hardware store. Each bolt costs $0.03. To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to do some simple math.

First, we calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts:
\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

So, the bolts cost $0.48 in total. Now, we subtract this amount from the $12.48 David has:
\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money David has left after buying the bolts is $12.00.

The correct answer is: \boxed{12.00}"
"Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of dog walking. To find out how much she would earn in 12 hours, we first need to know how much she earns per hour. 

So, we divide $33 by 3 hours:
\[ \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]
This means Ella earns $11 per hour.

Now, to find out how much she would earn in 12 hours, we multiply $11 by 12:
\[ 11 \times 12 = 132 \]

So, Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

The answer is: $132."
"Paul starts with 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more, so he now has:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Then, he loses one-fourth of his marbles. One-fourth of 80 is:

\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \]

So, he loses 20 marbles. To find out how many he has left, we subtract the 20 marbles he lost from the 80 he had:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the points for the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 questions, and Amy got 80% of them right. So, we calculate 80% of 10:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \]
Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, so she got 8 points from these questions.

Next, we calculate the points for the true/false questions. There are 20 questions, and Amy got 90% of them right. So, we calculate 90% of 20:
\[ 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \]
Each true/false question is worth 1 point, so she got 18 points from these questions.

Finally, we calculate the points for the long-answer questions. There are 5 questions, and Amy got 60% of them right. So, we calculate 60% of 5:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]
Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she got \(3 \times 5 = 15\) points from these questions.

Now, we add up all the points:
\[ 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \]

So, Amy's total score is 41."
"To make a profit of $2000, Isaias needs to sell his chickens at $50 each. He has 300 chickens and plans to sell 3/5 of them. First, we find out how many chickens he plans to sell:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens. If he sells each chicken for $50, the total money he will get is:

\[ 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Since he wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is:

\[ 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{7000} \]"
"Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. The boys together sold 18 glasses, and since they sold an equal number, each boy sold 9 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold. So, 14 - 9 = 5. Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

The answer is 5."
"Iris spent $400 on her hair. For her manicure, she spent 1/4 of what she spent on her hair, which is $100. For her pedicure, she spent 3/4 of what she spent on her manicure, which is $75. So, the total amount she spent at the spa is $400 + $100 + $75, which equals $575.

The correct answer is: $575."
"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long. Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 a meter. So, the total money Sarah will get from selling the rope is 20 meters times $2 per meter, which equals $40. 

Sarah plans to use this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. If she buys a 20-meter rope, it will cost her 20 meters times $1.5 per meter, which equals $30.

After buying the new rope, the money Sarah will have left is $40 minus $30, which equals $10.

So, the money Sarah will have left over is $10."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out her current age, we subtract 10 from 18:

18 - 10 = 8

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we want to know in how many years her age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

3 × 8 = 24

We need to find out how many years it will take for her to be 24. Since she is currently 8, we subtract her current age from 24:

24 - 8 = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

The answer is: 16"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10 in total. So, each pack of bacon costs $10 ÷ 5 = $2.

Next, she bought 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs $2 × 2 = $4. The total cost for chicken is $4 × 6 = $24.

She also bought 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. So, the total cost for strawberries is $4 × 3 = $12.

Lastly, she bought 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2. The total cost for apples is $2 × 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the money she has left is $65 - $60 = $5.

The answer is $5."
"Elaina's final concert was 65 minutes long. This concert was twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore. If we let the usual length of her concerts be \( x \) minutes, then we can write the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Then we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. So, he gives away a total of 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys. Now, to find out how many toys Argo has left, we subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the number he started with. That is 200 - 150 = 50 toys. 

So, Argo has 50 toys now."
"On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas. On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas. On Fridays, they make twice as many as on a Tuesday, which is 250 chimichangas. So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 125 + 125 + 250 = 500.

The answer is 500."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. The singer has 50 microphones and 20% of them won't fit. So, first, we need to find out how many microphones won't fit. 

20% of 50 is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. That means the singer can use:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, these 40 microphones need to be arranged in pairs. Since each pair has 2 microphones, the number of pairs is:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer can arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. 

The answer is: \boxed{20}"
"Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then, he sees \(\frac{2}{3}\) of 6 birds flying overhead, which is 4 birds. He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds feeding, which is 24 birds. So, the total number of birds he sees is 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.

The total number of birds Jerry counts is 34."
"Lani baked 55 cookies. She ate 5 of them, so she had 50 left. She put these 50 cookies in 5 jars equally. So, each jar got 50 divided by 5, which is 10 cookies.

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many petals the orchids have in total. Joelle has 5 orchids and each orchid has 5 petals. So, we multiply 5 by 5, which gives us 25 petals for the orchids.

Next, we need to know how many petals the African daisies have in total. Joelle has 4 daisies and each daisy has 10 petals. So, we multiply 4 by 10, which gives us 40 petals for the daisies.

Now, we need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids. We do this by subtracting the number of petals on the orchids from the number of petals on the daisies. So, we take 40 and subtract 25, which gives us 15.

Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.

The final answer is 15."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. 

First, we need to find out how many indoor plants there are. One-fourth of 100 is 25, so there are 25 indoor plants.

Next, we need to find out how many plants are left after taking away the indoor plants. So, 100 minus 25 equals 75 plants.

Now, two-thirds of these 75 plants are outdoor plants. To find out how many that is, we do 2 divided by 3 times 75, which equals 50 outdoor plants.

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. So, we take the 75 plants left and subtract the 50 outdoor plants, which leaves us with 25 flowering plants.

To find out what percentage of the plants are flowering, we take the number of flowering plants, which is 25, and divide it by the total number of plants, which is 100. Then we multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So, 25 divided by 100 times 100 equals 25%.

So, the answer is 25%."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, if we divide 121 by 11, we get the speed of the thingamabob. 

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, a whirligig spins 5 times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5.

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

So, the speed of the whirligig is 55 meters per second."
"Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so it's $3. That means the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9. Ellen spends $11 in total, so the carrots must cost $11 - $9 = $2. Since she eats two carrots, one carrot costs $2 ÷ 2 = $1.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. He used to make $10 an hour, but now he makes $12 an hour after a raise of $2.

To find out how much he makes in a week, we need to calculate it step by step:

1. First, find out how many hours he works in a week:
   8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week

2. Then, multiply the hours he works in a week by his new hourly wage:
   40 hours/week * $12/hour = $480/week

So, Mark makes $480 a week."
"Tasha made $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. She mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times as much as Joe's, and Alba's lawn five times as much as Joe's. Joe paid her $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

First, let's figure out how much Tasha earned from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: 1 time × $6 = $6
- Kamala's lawn: 3 times × $6 = $18
- Alba's lawn: 5 times × $6 = $30

Now, add up the money from mowing lawns:
$6 + $18 + $30 = $54

Tasha made $80 in total. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the money from mowing lawns from the total:
$80 - $54 = $26

So, Tasha made $26 from lemonade sales."
"Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl is 16 kg heavier than Martin, so Carl's weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg. Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, so Christian's weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg. Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so Harry's weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

The weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. He and his wife are adults, and they have 2 children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, the total number of bowls needed is 2 for the adults and 2 for the children, which is 4 bowls in total. Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, it means the pot has enough for 4 adult bowls. After the family eats their bowls, there is no soup left for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

So, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

The answer is $8.00."
"To figure out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. So, for 1 small mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \]

Now, for 20 small masks, she needs:
\[ 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we know that Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, for 1 large mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \]

Now, for 8 large masks, she needs:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the material needed for the small and large masks together, we get:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, Jo needs 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. The problem says that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, if we let Adam's age four years ago be \( A \), then four years ago, Adam was \( A - 4 \) years old. According to the problem, 52 is two times \( A - 4 \).

So, we have:
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2A - 8 \]
\[ 52 + 8 = 2A \]
\[ 60 = 2A \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. In 8 years, Adam will be:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. How many bottles of water does he drink in that time?

To figure this out, first, we need to know how long it takes to solve an extreme sudoku. Since a normal one takes 45 minutes, and an extreme one takes 4 times that, we do:

\[ 45 \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, since John drinks a bottle every half hour, we need to see how many half hours are in 180 minutes. We do:

\[ \frac{180}{30} = 6 \]

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.

The answer is: \(\boxed{6}\)"
"Benny threw bologna at his balloons. He threw 2 pieces at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. If there were 20 red balloons, we need to find out how many yellow balloons there were.

First, we calculate the total pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
20 red balloons * 2 pieces each = 40 pieces

Now, we subtract the pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total pieces:
58 pieces - 40 pieces = 18 pieces

These 18 pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces, we divide the remaining pieces by 3 to find the number of yellow balloons:
18 pieces / 3 pieces each = 6 yellow balloons

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6.

The answer is: \boxed{6}"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. There are 30 students, and each sold 10 lollipops. So, the total number of lollipops sold is:
   \[
   30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. Next, we calculate the total money made from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8. So, the total revenue is:
   \[
   300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much it cost to buy all these lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5. So, the total cost is:
   \[
   300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Finally, to find out the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
   \[
   240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's count all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{47}
\]"
"Abby eats 2 slices of bread each day, and Josh eats twice as much, which means he eats 4 slices each day. Together, they eat 6 slices each day. The loaf has 24 slices, so the loaf will last for 4 days.

Answer: \boxed{4}"
"Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old. By her 10th birthday, she would have been collecting shells for 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, she would have collected shells for 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months. So, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

The answer is 60."
"Lana is making tea for her friends. She has 27 cups of tea and puts them in 3 rows. So, each row has:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

cups. In each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. This means she makes half chamomile and half mint in each row. So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ 9 \div 2 = 4.5 \]

So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is 4.5. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"A three-toed sloth moves very slowly and only eats when it is up in its tree. It takes the sloth 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to figure out how many berries it picks up per trip.

First, we calculate how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth picks up per trip. If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip} \]

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the pool has 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half of that amount. So, the tank gets:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water left in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"Colby has $150 each month to spend on movies. He has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, which cost $10 each, and 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each. He also had 2 tubs of popcorn for $8 each and 4 boxes of candy for $2 each.

First, let's calculate how much he has spent so far:
- For the 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays: \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- For the 8 movies on other days: \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- For the 2 tubs of popcorn: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- For the 4 boxes of candy: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these up, the total amount spent is:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\] dollars.

Colby has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend. On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a movie ticket for $10, a tub of popcorn for $8, and a box of candy for $2. The total cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\] dollars.

Since he has exactly $20 left, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini one has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of that. So, \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories for a mini cinnamon roll. Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

Next, we do the same for the blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of that. So, \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories for a mini blueberry muffin. Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, we add the calories from both types of pastries together: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

So, the total calories from all the pastries Andrew baked is 85000."
"Rita picked Junebugs from her plants over a week. On Monday, she picked 39 Junebugs. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked twice as many as Monday, so that's 78 each day. Thursday she picked 48, and Friday she picked 57. To find the average number of Junebugs she picked per day, we need to add up all the Junebugs and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add them up:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

Adding these together:
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300

Now, we divide the total by the number of days, which is 5:
300 ÷ 5 = 60

So, the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day is 60.

**Answer: 60**"
"The bus went 300 miles and the car went 240 miles. To find out how much farther the bus went, we subtract the car's distance from the bus's distance. So, 300 miles minus 240 miles equals 60 miles. The bus went 60 miles farther than the car."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

31 + 8 + 9 = 48

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. So, to find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the total number of the other toys from 62:
62 - 48 = 14

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean together are 100 years old. So, if we add their ages, it should be 100.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean. So, if Jean is \( J \) years old, then Paul is \( J + 10 \) years old.
3. Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages. So, Peter is \( (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \) years old.

Now, let's put it all together:
- Peter's age: \( 2J + 10 \)
- Paul's age: \( J + 10 \)
- Jean's age: \( J \)

Adding these up, we get:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we can find the ages:
- Jean is 20 years old.
- Paul is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) years old.
- Peter is \( 2(20) + 10 = 50 \) years old.

So, Peter is 50 years old.

The answer is: \boxed{50}"
"Maria invited 4 friends for a water balloon fight. She gave each friend 2 balloons, so that's 4 friends times 2 balloons each, which is 8 balloons. Maria had 1 balloon for herself. Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons, so that's 5 people times 3 balloons each, which is 15 balloons. Adding all the balloons together, we get 8 (from friends) + 1 (from Maria) + 15 (from mom) = 24 balloons. So, the total number of balloons is 24.

The answer is: 24"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. They get 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes already, so the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can hold 2 boxes, so to find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by 2:
\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already have 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Zoey has 40 seeds and each seed is spat 10 feet, so she spits a total of 400 feet. Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed is spat 12 feet, so she spits a total of 420 feet. To find the average, we add these two totals together and then divide by 2. So, 400 + 420 = 820. Then, 820 divided by 2 is 410. 

The average total distance spat is 410 feet."
"Fern is trying to decide between two machines: the Widgeteer 3000 and the WidgetMaster 9000. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6.

First, let's find out how many widgets each machine makes in a month. A month has 30 days, and the machines run 24 hours a day.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Widgets per hour: 60
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30
- Total widgets per month = 60 * 24 * 30 = 43,200 widgets

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Widgets per hour: 45
- Hours per day: 24
- Days per month: 30
- Total widgets per month = 45 * 24 * 30 = 32,400 widgets

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these widgets. Each widget sells for $6.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, we find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

So, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

Answer: $64,800"
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For the extra 5 hours, it charges 70 pesos per hour. So, the cost for the extra 5 hours is 5 times 70, which is 350 pesos. Adding this to the 1000 pesos, the total cost is 1350 pesos.

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos. So, the money he would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1600 minus 1350, which is 250 pesos.

The answer is: 250"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. For the sheep, it says they need 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, twice what a goat needs is 2 times 5, which is 10 pounds. Then, 3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds for each sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total hay needed. There are 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds, so that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds for the goats. For the sheep, there are 12 of them, and each needs 7 pounds, so that's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds for the sheep.

Adding these together, we get 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay in total.

So, the answer is 159 pounds."
"John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. He spent 50 dollars on gas, so he had 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left. He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he had 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left. He bought 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so he spent 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils. After buying the pencils, he had 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. He wants to buy pens that cost 25 dollars each, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.

The answer is: 4"
"Craig and his brother have been spelling out words and counting the letters. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total of 50 more letters than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters they've spelled together, we add the letters Craig and his brother have spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. So, for one school, the number of children is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).
4. There are 5 different schools.
5. Therefore, the total number of children is \(56 \times 5 = 280\).

So, the total number of children in the drill is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, the teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be exchanged for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:
\[ 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, there are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:
\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house, plus $35 for each hour of work, and they use parts which cost $60. For this job, it took 2.25 hours and used $60 in parts.

First, we calculate the labor cost:
- $35 per hour for 2.25 hours is $35 * 2.25 = $78.75.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Visit charge: $40
- Labor charge: $78.75
- Parts charge: $60

Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

So, the total charge for the job is $178.75."
"James buys 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets a 40% discount, so the discount amount is:

\[ 150 \times 0.40 = 60 \]

The cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each, so he gets:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Since he only spent $90 and sold the CDs for $200, he didn't lose any money. The answer is:

"Jen has some root crops to sell. She has 6 yams at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each, and 4 carrots at $1.25 each. Let's calculate how much she will earn from each type of crop.

For the yams:
6 yams × $1.5 = $9

For the sweet potatoes:
10 sweet potatoes × $2 = $20

For the carrots:
4 carrots × $1.25 = $5

Now, let's add up all the earnings:
$9 + $20 + $5 = $34

So, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn $34."
"James swims across a 20-mile lake. He swims 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles. He swims at 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 6 hours to swim 12 miles. After swimming, he rests for half the time he swam, which is 3 hours. Then he swims the remaining 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. So, it takes him 8 hours to swim the remaining distance. Adding all the times together, it takes him 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across the lake.

The answer is 17 hours."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. Now, we need to find out how many loaves the bakery has. The bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had.

Seven times the number of loaves Sam had is:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, we need to subtract 40 from 490 to find out how many loaves the bakery has:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The correct answer is 450."
"Jasmine starts with no stickers. She gets 15 stickers for participating in class, so she has 15 stickers. Then she loses 7 stickers during playtime, so she has 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left. Her teacher gives her 5 more stickers for helping classmates, so she ends up with 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

The final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13."
"Cayley sells newspapers and gets a commission on each one. For the New York Times, he gets 10% of the price of each copy, and for the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8% of the price of each copy. Each New York Times costs $5, and each Wall Street Journal costs $15. He sells 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.

First, let's calculate the commission for the New York Times:
- Each New York Times is $5, and he gets 10% of that, so he gets $5 * 0.10 = $0.50 per copy.
- He sells 6 copies, so the total commission is $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Next, let's calculate the commission for the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal is $15, and he gets 8% of that, so he gets $15 * 0.08 = $1.20 per copy.
- He sells 10 copies, so the total commission is $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total commission:
- Total commission = $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00.

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15.00."

"Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored 45 points. Bahati scored the most, 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar. We need to find out how many points Azibo scored.

Let's say Azibo scored \( A \) points. Then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points. Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points are:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]

Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. The book is 1.5 inches thick. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page on each side. To find out how many pages are in the book, we first calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches of paper:

1.5 inches × 100 pages per inch = 150 pages

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages. So, we divide the total number of pages by 2:

150 pages ÷ 2 = 75 pages

So, the book has 75 pages."
"Vince can staple 30 reports in 15 minutes. He was stapling from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM. That's 15 hours. 

First, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 15 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 15 hours, there are 15 times 60, which is 900 minutes. 

Now, we divide 900 minutes by 15 minutes to find out how many intervals there are: 
900 divided by 15 is 60 intervals.

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply 60 intervals by 30 reports: 
60 times 30 is 1800 reports.

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.

The answer is 1800."
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. That's 480 minutes. One day, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. She was also awake before getting out of bed for 220 minutes. So, the total time she was awake is 220 + 23 = 243 minutes. Therefore, the time she slept is 480 - 243 = 237 minutes.

"The hospital can hold 1000 patients. Right now, 1/5 of the beds are full. So, 1/5 of 1000 is 200. That means 200 patients are already there. Each day, 50 more patients come. In 2 weeks, which is 14 days, 50 patients each day means 50 * 14 = 700 more patients. So, the total number of patients after 2 weeks is 200 (already there) + 700 (new patients) = 900. The hospital has 1000 beds, so the number of empty beds is 1000 - 900 = 100.

The answer is 100."
"Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the number of emails that are not work emails is:

"If Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert and Kelly said Courtney was wrong by 20%, we need to find out how many people were really there.

If Courtney's number was 20% more than the real number, we can think of it like this: the real number of people is 100%, and Courtney's number is 120% of the real number. So, if 120% is 48, we need to find out what 100% is.

To do this, we can set up a simple equation:
\[ 120\% \text{ of the real number} = 48 \]
\[ 1.2 \times \text{real number} = 48 \]

Now, to find the real number, we divide 48 by 1.2:
\[ \text{real number} = \frac{48}{1.2} = 40 \]

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that Jason carried 2 balls, and he carried twice as many as Jeffrey. So, Jeffrey must have carried 1 ball because 2 is twice 1. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so Jordan carried 4 balls (since 2 times 2 is 4). Now, if we add up all the balls, we get:

Jeffrey: 1 ball
Jason: 2 balls
Jordan: 4 balls

So, the total number of balls is 1 + 2 + 4, which equals 7.

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7."
"The pirates dug a total of 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day but filled in 2 holes. So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:

10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + (8 - 2) (third day) = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes.

By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day, which is 4 * 10 = 40 holes.

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

40 (end of fourth day) - 29 (end of third day) = 11 holes.

The answer is 11."
"Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, so together they got 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips. Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, so Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips. Adding all the corn chips together, we get 140 + 85 = 225 corn chips. So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. So, we first find 50% of $400:

So, the total cost of travel is $600.

Answer: $600"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know that together they caught 339 Pokemon. Let's say Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon. 

Stan caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe caught, so Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon. 

Alex caught 5 more than what Stan caught, so Alex caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon. 

Now, if we add up all the Pokemon they caught, it should equal 339. So, we have:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan caught. Since Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \):
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan caught \(\boxed{147}\) Pokemon."
"Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long. The number of episodes is half the number of minutes in one episode. So, if one episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show."
"The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so it travels \(10 \times 30 = 300\) miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, covering \(2 \times 18 = 36\) miles. Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering \(5 \times 22 = 110\) miles. 

To find the total distance south, we add the first and third legs: \(300 + 110 = 410\) miles. We subtract the distance flown north: \(410 - 36 = 374\) miles.

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles. 

**Answer: 374 miles**"
"Greta made 12 brownies for herself. At her office party, she got 6 more brownies. When her friends threw her a surprise party, she got 48 brownies. During the surprise party, 18 brownies were eaten. 

Let's count the total brownies Greta had:
- 12 (initial batch) + 6 (from office party) + 48 (from friends) = 66 brownies.

Then, we subtract the brownies that were eaten:
- 66 (total brownies) - 18 (eaten) = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 brownies left over."
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 6 years old. The total age of all three is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

Answer: 30"
"To figure out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to do some simple math.

For the 3 racquets with synthetic gut:
3 times 15 minutes = 45 minutes

For the 5 racquets with polyester string:
5 times 22 minutes = 110 minutes

For the 4 racquets with a hybrid set:
4 times 18 minutes = 72 minutes

Now, we add all these times together:
45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = 227 minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes 4 phones in total. The first two phones cost $600 each, so that's 2 times $600, which is $1200. The other two phones are half price, so they cost $300 each. That's 2 times $300, which is $600. Adding the two amounts together, $1200 plus $600, gives us $1800. So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is $1800.

The correct answer is: $1800."
"Zeke's baseball team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. Carlton's team has 13 players. So, to find out how many players Zeke's team has, we add 7 to 13, which gives us 20 players. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in Zeke's team to the number of players in Carlton's team. That is, 20 plus 13, which equals 33. So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To figure out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to know the total length of the fence. The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, so we add these together and then multiply by 2 because a rectangle has two lengths and two widths.

So, \(15 + 10 = 25\). Then, \(25 \times 2 = 50\) feet for the whole perimeter.

Now, for every foot of the fence, Robert needs 2 wooden slats. So, we multiply the total feet by 2.

\(50 \times 2 = 100\).

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats.

The answer is: 100."
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 4 boxes in total. That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes. She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes, which is 8 / 4 = 2 boxes. So, she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

The answer is 120."
"India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. The USA has 50 states. Half of 50 is 25, and 4 more than 25 is 29. So, India has 29 states. 

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the states of the USA and India together: 50 + 29 = 79.

The total number of states in both countries together is 79."
"Tyler wants to buy some books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. He has $14 saved. He earns $5 for every hour he works.

First, let's add up the cost of the books:
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Now, let's see how much more money Tyler needs:
Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:
Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books."
"Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries. Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 20 cherries. If we add up the cherries Richard and Robert have, that's 20 + 30 = 50 cherries. Since they have 60 cherries in total, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries. Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries: 30 - 10 = 20. So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

The answer is: 20"
"On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 6 boxes of apple pie. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie. Gingerbread costs $6 and apple pie costs $15.

For Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes × $6 = $60
- Apple pie: 6 boxes × $15 = $90
- Total for Saturday: $60 + $90 = $150

For Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 15 boxes × $6 = $90
- Apple pie: 15 boxes × $15 = $225
- Total for Sunday: $90 + $225 = $315

Total earnings for both days:
- $150 + $315 = $465

The total amount Sunny earned for two days is $465."
"Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She will be outside for 4 hours a day over 8 days. So, each day she uses 4 ounces of sunscreen. Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle: \(32 \text{ ounces} \div 8 \text{ ounces/bottle} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is cheaper than the blue car by 40%. The blue car costs $100. To find out how much the red car costs, we need to calculate 40% of $100 and then subtract that from $100.

40% of $100 is \(0.40 \times 100 = 40\).

So, the red car costs \(100 - 40 = 60\).

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\(100 + 60 = 160\).

So, both cars cost a total of $160."
"Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, that will be in 5 years. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old. Also, at that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

To find their current ages, we subtract 5 years from their ages when Emil is 24.

So, Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
And Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

The sum of their current ages is 43 + 7 = 50.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
50"
"Adrienne got beads from her mother, sister, and friend. Her mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so that's 20 x 2 = 40 beads. 

To find out how many beads Adrienne has altogether, we add them up: 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

So, Adrienne has 90 beads in total."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of what he caught on Friday, which is 6 pounds. So, the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days is 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds. Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings he has is 21 ÷ 3 = 7 servings.

The final answer is 7 servings."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students are football players. Since 20% of the class are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students are left after the football players. So, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Now, out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we add the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

So, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's. Sophie wears size five boots. So, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Now, to find the average size of the boots they wear, we add the sizes together and divide by 2:

\[ \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and she needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. So, each plant needs 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet of space. 

To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant needs: 111 / 2.5 = 44.4. Since Pat can't have a fraction of a plant, she can fit 44 plants in the flower bed.

Pat already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants. Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is 27 * $6 = $162.

The answer is: $162."
"Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, his brother eats 9 pretzels a day. In a week, which has 7 days, his brother eats 63 pretzels. So, the answer is 63."
"Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill. Each basket needs 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. Petunias cost $3.00 each, and sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each.

First, let's find out how many petunias she needs:
- 3 petunias per basket
- 5 baskets
- Total petunias = 3 * 5 = 15

Next, let's find out how many sweet potato vines she needs:
- 2 sweet potato vines per basket
- 5 baskets
- Total sweet potato vines = 2 * 5 = 10

Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias:
- 15 petunias
- $3.00 each
- Total cost for petunias = 15 * $3.00 = $45.00

Then, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:
- 10 sweet potato vines
- $2.50 each
- Total cost for sweet potato vines = 10 * $2.50 = $25.00

Finally, let's add the costs together:
- Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.

**Answer: $70.00**"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. They bought a 30-pound bag of soil. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds, and they planted 4 sunflowers. So, the soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and they planted 10 carnations. So, the soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds. Adding the soil used for sunflowers and carnations, we get \(12 + 15 = 27\) pounds. They started with 30 pounds, so the soil left for roses is \(30 - 27 = 3\) pounds. Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant \(3 \div 1 = 3\) roses.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To figure out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how long it takes her to peel the shrimp. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. So, to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6:
\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \]
So, it takes her 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Next, we need to know how long it takes her to cook the shrimp. She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can cook 3 shrimp in 1 minute. So, to cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 3:
\[ 90 \div 3 = 30 \]
So, it takes her 30 minutes to cook 90 shrimp.

Since she needs to do both tasks, we add the time for peeling and cooking:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \]
So, it will take her 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

The answer is 45 minutes."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The air conditioner was on low for 3 hours. It cools the room 2 degrees per hour, so in 3 hours, it cools the room by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. It cools the room 3 degrees per hour, so in 4 hours, it cools the room by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. After that, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. The room warms up 2 degrees per hour, so in 2 hours, it warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's add up the cooling and warming:
- Cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Warming: \(-4\) degrees.

So, the net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

The final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

**Final answer: 14**"
"Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old. Since the comet comes around every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years. So, if Bill was 90 years old the second time, he must have been \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old the first time he saw the comet.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Buford writes checks every month for the electric bill and the gas bill. That's 12 checks for each, so that's 24 checks. He writes 2 checks to the church every month, which is 24 checks a year. He writes 1 check every quarter to the pest and lawn service, and there are 4 quarters in a year, so that's 4 checks. Adding them all up: 24 (electric) + 24 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn) = 56 checks. So, Buford writes 56 checks per year.

The correct answer is: 56."
"The first plane makes 88 flights in a day. Out of these, three-quarters go to Greece, so that's 66 flights. The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, so that's 22 flights split equally, which means 11 flights to France.

Answer: 11"
"Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that's 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, which is 60 seconds. So, the total time for all three wolves' howls is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds. To find out how many minutes that is, we divide by 60 because there are 60 seconds in a minute. So, 120 ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

The combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

\[

"Adam bought some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much, which is $12. So, his parents gave him a total of $6 + $12 = $18. The trousers cost $30, so Adam had to contribute $30 - $18 = $12 from his savings.

The answer is $12."
"Akbar is 3 years old, Alessandro is 4 years old, and the total age of the four children is 20. Let's find out how old Wilfred is.

First, we know the total age of all four children:
\[3 + 4 + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20\]

This simplifies to:
\[7 + \text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} = 20\]

So, the sum of Helene's age and Wilfred's age is:
\[\text{Helene's age} + \text{Wilfred's age} = 13\]

We also know that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age is:
\[\frac{20}{4} = 5\]

So, Helene's age is:
\[2 \times 5 = 10\]

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from 13:
\[13 - 10 = 3\]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old."

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6000."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cookies were brought to the reception. There were 100 guests, and each brought 15 cookies. So, we multiply 100 by 15:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Next, the bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church. So, we divide 1500 by 2:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Now, if each person in the church got 15 cookies, we need to find out how many people that would be. We divide 750 by 15:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We have a watermelon to share among a family of 6 people, 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \(x\). Then each adult gets a slice of size \(2x\).

So, the total slices we have are:
- 2 adults: \(2 \times 2x = 4x\)
- 4 kids: \(4 \times x = 4x\)

Adding these up, we get \(4x + 4x = 8x\).

Now, we want to know what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult gets \(2x\), and the total is \(8x\).

To find the percentage, we do:
\[
\frac{2x}{8x} \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The answer is 25%."

"The dance studio has 10 students and rents the studio 3 days a week. Each session costs $25 to rent the studio and $1.50 per student. So, for each session, the cost is $25 + (10 students * $1.50) = $25 + $15 = $40. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the cost per week is $40 * 3 = $120. Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost is $120 * 4 = $480.

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \boxed{480}."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, if we divide 64 by 4, we get the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Next, Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars. If we divide 56 by 7, we get the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes:
\[ 56 \div 7 = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in Martha's box from the number in Peter's box:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The answer is: \(\boxed{8}\)"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 50 porcupines in the park. Out of these, 3 out of every 5 are female. So, we calculate the number of female porcupines:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of baby porcupines born each month is:
\[ 30 \times 4 = 120 \]

There are 12 months in a year, so the number of baby porcupines born in a year is:
\[ 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

Now, we add the baby porcupines to the original number of porcupines to find the total number in the park after a year:
\[ 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much water the pool can hold. The pool is shaped like a big box, so we can use the formula for the volume of a box, which is length times width times depth.

The pool is 25 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 4 feet deep. So, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert this volume into gallons. The pool company said to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by $0.10:

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The final answer is: \boxed{826}"

So, the total number of sticks is 34."
"Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles. Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles. To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The school has 3000 students in total.
2. Half of these students are over 16 years old, so that's 1500 students.
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so that's 375 male students.
4. The rest of the students over 16 are female, so that's 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students.
5. The other half of the students are under 16 years old, so that's also 1500 students.
6. Half of the students under 16 are male, so that's 750 male students.
7. The rest of the students under 16 are female, so that's 1500 - 750 = 750 female students.
8. To find the total number of female students, we add the female students over 16 and under 16, so that's 1125 + 750 = 1875.

So, the total number of female students is 1875."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 14 laps. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, which means Shaelyn can run 7 laps. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 5 laps. To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:

10 - 5 = 5

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, the tank can hold 18,000 gallons of water.

On the first day:
- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, so she filled \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B filled 3/4 as much as Wanda, so she filled \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \) gallons.
- Together, they filled \( 4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \) gallons on the first day.

On the second day:
- Wanda filled 2/3 of what she filled on the first day, so she filled \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B filled 1/3 of what she filled on the first day, so she filled \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \) gallons.
- Together, they filled \( 3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 \) gallons on the second day.

Total water filled over two days:
- \( 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 \) gallons.

So, the remaining capacity of the tank is:
- \( 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 \) gallons.

The answer is 6,000 gallons."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Maria's power bank was losing charge over time. First, it lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. Then, it lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 more hours. After all this, the power bank had 28% charge left.

Let's break it down:

1. After 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% each hour. So, it kept 91% of its charge each hour. That means after 5 hours, it had \(0.91^5\) of its original charge left.
2. After the next 3 hours, it lost 7% each hour, so it kept 93% of its charge each hour. That means after these 3 hours, it had \(0.93^3\) of the charge it had after the first 5 hours left.

So, the charge left after 8 hours is:
\[0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \times \text{original charge} = 0.28\]

Now, let's calculate \(0.91^5 \times 0.93^3\):
\[0.91^5 \approx 0.624\]
\[0.93^3 \approx 0.804\]
\[0.624 \times 0.804 \approx 0.502\]

So, \(0.502 \times \text{original charge} = 0.28\).

To find the original charge, we divide 0.28 by 0.502:
\[\text{original charge} = \frac{0.28}{0.502} \approx 0.5578\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the original charge is about 56%.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"Janet works as a waitress. She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips. That means she earns a total of $25 an hour. She wants to save 20% of $10,000 for a car down payment. So, she needs to save $2,000. If she works 40 hours a week, she earns $1,000 a week. To save $2,000, she needs to work for 2 weeks.

So, the answer is 2 weeks."
"Jamaar has $10 and he bought some fruits. The peaches cost $0.5 each, pears cost $0.5 each, apples cost $0.75 each, and kiwis cost $1 each. He bought 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. 

First, let's find out how much he spent on each type of fruit:
- Peaches: 3 × $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 × $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 × $1 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 × $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of all the fruits:
$1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the money left is:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums."
"Anne bought a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally. First, we find out how many packs she gave away:

15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs

Next, we calculate the total number of sweets in those 13 packs:

13 packs × 60 pieces per pack = 780 pieces

Now, we divide the 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends:

780 pieces ÷ 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend

So, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets."
"Sure, let's figure out the price of carrots after three years. The price starts at $120 and increases by 5% each year. 

First, we need to find out what 5% of $120 is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 6 \]

So, the price increases by $6 each year. 

After the first year, the price will be:
\[ 120 + 6 = 126 \]

After the second year, the price will be:
\[ 126 + 6 = 132 \]

After the third year, the price will be:
\[ 132 + 6 = 138 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years is $138. 

The final answer is: \boxed{138}"
"Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, each album has 9 pictures. Out of these 8 albums, 3 are for selfies and 2 are for portraits. 

For the selfies, we have:

\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And for the portraits, we have:

\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding the selfies and portraits together:

\[ 27 + 18 = 45 \]

So, the total number of portraits and selfies is 45. 

The answer is: 45"
"James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we can first figure out how many sets of 3 pages are in 18 pages. 

18 pages divided by 3 pages per set is 6 sets. Since each set of 3 pages takes 10 minutes, we multiply 6 sets by 10 minutes per set.

6 sets * 10 minutes per set = 60 minutes

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. 

The answer is 60 minutes."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests left early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests left late, so we subtract 15 from 76:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who left late. Since 15 guests left late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to 61:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}
\]"
"On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas. On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas. On Friday, he picks three times the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4, so that's 12 bananas.

To find out how many bananas John has in total, we add the bananas from each day:

4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

So, John has 22 bananas in total."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Total questions: 60
2. Easy questions: 40% of 60 is \(0.40 \times 60 = 24\)
3. Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
4. Average and difficult questions: 36 divided by 2 is 18 each

Now, let's see how many questions Aries will get right:

1. Easy questions: Aries gets 75% of 24 right, which is \(0.75 \times 24 = 18\)
2. Average questions: Aries gets half of 18 right, which is \(18 \div 2 = 9\)
3. Difficult questions: Aries also gets half of 18 right, which is \(18 \div 2 = 9\)

Adding them up: \(18 + 9 + 9 = 36\)

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. We need to find out how many small stuffed animals she sold.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is \(x\). Then the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The price of a large stuffed animal is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars because it's three times the price of a small one.

The total money earned from selling stuffed animals is:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, the answer is 12."
"The man eats 5 sandwiches each day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches each day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches each day. To find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we first add up the sandwiches they eat each day:

5 (man) + 4 (wife) + 2 (son) = 11 sandwiches per day

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

11 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Suzanne sold 80 cookies for $1 each and 60 cupcakes for $4 each. She gave her two sisters $10 each for helping her. How much money does she have left from her earnings?

First, let's find out how much she made from the cookies:
80 cookies * $1 = $80

Next, let's find out how much she made from the cupcakes:
60 cupcakes * $4 = $240

Now, let's add the money from the cookies and cupcakes:
$80 + $240 = $320

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each:
$10 * 2 = $20

Finally, let's subtract the money given to her sisters from her total earnings:
$320 - $20 = $300

So, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings."
"The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. That leaves 40 eggs to be found. But it's said that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. So, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The answer is 30."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. 

First, we know one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore with his bare hands. 

With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day. 

With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so that's \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day. 

Now, if we have 40 dwarves each mining 36 pounds per day, that's \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day. 

Over 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore. 

So, the answer is \(\boxed{43200}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We have three packages of sandwiches:

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
3. The third package has 8 sandwiches, and we need to find out how much it costs.

First, let's see how much each sandwich costs in the first package:
- 2 sandwiches cost $3, so each sandwich costs $3 ÷ 2 = $1.50.

Now, let's check the second package:
- 4 sandwiches cost $6, so each sandwich costs $6 ÷ 4 = $1.50.

Since the price per sandwich is the same in both packages, we can use $1.50 for each sandwich to find the cost of the third package:
- The third package has 8 sandwiches, so the cost is 8 × $1.50 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12."
"Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old one for $1000, so he only needs to pay $2000 for the new one. He has to pay 10% each month on the $2000. So, he pays $200 each month.

"Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. A gust of wind made 40% of the red balloons burst, so that's 25 times 0.40, which is 10 red balloons. So, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left. She then released half of the yellow balloons, so that's 12 divided by 2, which is 6 yellow balloons. So, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left. When she found 8 blue balloons, she added 75% of them to her balloons, so that's 8 times 0.75, which is 6 blue balloons. So, she had 6 blue balloons. Adding all the balloons together, she had 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue, which is 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons. So, the number of balloons she carried into the school is 34."

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many seats are already taken. There are 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. So, we add those together:

\[ 950 + 300 = 1250 \]

Now, the Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. So, we need to find out how many seats are left for the graduates to give to their friends and family. We do this by subtracting the seats already taken from the total seats:

\[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

Now, we need to split these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates. So, we divide 4750 by 950:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate would get 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

"Richard is making a video of a science experiment with diet soda and a specific candy. He has a 24-foot wide driveway and wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet. This means he will place 9 bottles of soda (since 24 divided by 3 is 8, and he starts with one at the beginning).

It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next and drop the candy. Since there are 8 intervals between the 9 bottles, it will take him 8 times 5 seconds to place all the bottles and drop the candy.

So, the total time is 8 times 5, which is 40 seconds.

The answer is: 40 seconds."
"Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples. Each box has 40 apples. So, the total number of apples is:

"Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized bed. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric will be:
6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet

And the width of each piece of fabric will be:
8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet

Now, to find out how much fabric he needs for one piece, we multiply the length by the width:
8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet

Since he needs two pieces, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric."
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters, which is 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery. On Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters, which is 5 more than twice Tuesday's delivery. So, to find out how many letters they delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add up all the letters delivered each day.

Monday: 425 letters
Tuesday: 102 letters
Wednesday: 209 letters

Total letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736

"Sure, let's figure out how much Molly will spend on the catering.

First, we need to calculate the cost for the chicken salad. There are 10 people who want chicken salad, and it costs $6.50 per person. So, we multiply 10 by $6.50:
\[ 10 \times 6.50 = 65 \]
So, the cost for the chicken salad is $65.

Next, we calculate the cost for the pasta salad. There are 6 people who want pasta salad, and it costs $6 per person. So, we multiply 6 by $6:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]
So, the cost for the pasta salad is $36.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 65 + 36 = 101 \]

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.

The final answer is:

"Johnny's dad went to watch horse racing and bet some money. In the first race, he lost $5. In the second race, he won $11 because he won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race. In the third race, he lost $16.50, which is 1.5 times what he won in the second race.

To find out how much he lost on average, we need to add up all the losses and wins, then divide by the number of races.

First, let's add up the losses:
- First race: $5
- Third race: $16.50
Total losses: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50

Now, let's add up the win:
- Second race: $11

So, the total amount of money he had after all the races is:
$21.50 (losses) - $11 (win) = $10.50 (net loss)

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races:
$10.50 ÷ 3 races = $3.50 per race

So, the average loss per race is $3.50."
"In South America, there are 26 countries. Each country has 5 cities, and each city has 1,000 people living in it. To find the total number of people, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country, and then multiply that by the number of people in each city.

So, first, we calculate the total number of cities:
26 countries * 5 cities per country = 130 cities

Next, we calculate the total number of people:
130 cities * 1,000 people per city = 130,000 people

Therefore, the total number of people in South America is 130,000.

"Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have grown over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches.

First, let's figure out how tall Xavier is now. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 4 feet is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Xavier grew 3 more inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was already 50 inches tall and grew 2 more inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:
\[ 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, let's say the first person got \(x\) dollars. 

The second person got \(x + 80\) dollars because they got $80 more than the first person.

The third person got twice what the second person got, so they got \(2 \times (x + 80)\) dollars.

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Now, let's simplify this:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the first person got $420.

The answer is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many hours they worked each day. Since they worked for 3/8 of a day, and a day has 24 hours, we calculate:
\[ 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days they worked in total. Since they worked for 3 weeks and there are 7 days in a week, we have:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Now, we calculate the total hours worked by the team over these 21 days:
\[ 9 \times 21 = 189 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:
\[ \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter worked 47.25 hours.

**Final Answer: 47.25**"
"Rory is picking up tennis balls after a match. In the first set, he picked up 4 more balls than in the second set. In the third set, he picked up half as many balls as in the second set. He picked up 19 balls in total.

Let's say he picked up \( x \) balls in the second set. Then in the first set, he picked up \( x + 4 \) balls. In the third set, he picked up \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls. The total is 19 balls, so we can write:

\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this, we need to find \( x \). First, we combine like terms:

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Next, we multiply everything by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 8 + x = 38 \]

Now, we combine the \( x \) terms:

\[ 5x + 8 = 38 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, he picked up 6 balls. In the first set, he picked up:

\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of balls he picked up in the first set is 10.

The answer is: 10"
"Sure, let's figure out the price of the car in 2010. Ben bought the car for $20,000 in 2007, and it depreciates by 21% each year. That means the car keeps 79% of its value each year.

To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for 3 years. We can do this by multiplying the initial value by 0.79 three times.

First, let's calculate 0.79 three times:
0.79 * 0.79 * 0.79 = 0.493039

Now, we multiply this by the initial value of $20,000:
20,000 * 0.493039 = 9,860.78

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9,860.78.

The correct answer is: $9,860.78"
"There are 50 books in the library. Half of them are in English, so that's 25 books. Then, 10% are in German, which is 5 books. The rest are in Spanish. So, we subtract the English and German books from the total:

50 - 25 - 5 = 20

So, there are 20 Spanish books."
"Okay, so we know the total distance from San Diego to New York is about 1955 kilometers. Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers. To find out how much farther she needs to go, we subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.

So, 1955 kilometers minus 325 kilometers equals 1630 kilometers.

The answer is 1630 kilometers."
"Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she drinks 240 cups. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, she drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days. So, the answer is 15 gallons."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people get on the train. So, the number of people becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people get off and 100 more get on. So, the number of people becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 people get off. So, the number of people becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

So, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}
\]"
"Alison bought a tank top for $10, running shorts for $15 (since they were $5 more than the tank top), and tennis shoes for $24 (half of $48). She also bought a package of athletic socks for $6 after using a $2 coupon. 

So, the total cost is:
\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

She spent $55 on athletic gear."
"To figure out the cost to renovate your kitchen floor, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many tiles we need. Each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot, so each tile covers 1 square foot. Your kitchen floor is 200 square feet, so you will need 200 tiles.

Next, we need to know how much each tile costs. Each tile costs $12.

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"James has to pay more for his insurance because of an accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, but now it's 60% more. To find out how much more, we do:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year."
"Greg uses clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week. His laundry machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time. We need to find out how many loads of laundry he does in a year.

First, let's calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:
- For twin beds: 4 sheets per week × 52 weeks = 208 sheets.
- For the king bed: 1 sheet per week × 52 weeks = 52 sheets.

Next, we need to figure out how many loads of laundry he does:
- For twin sheets: 208 sheets ÷ 2 sheets per load = 104 loads.
- For king sheets: 52 sheets ÷ 1 sheet per load = 52 loads.

Adding these together gives us the total number of loads:
104 loads + 52 loads = 156 loads.

So, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 156."
"Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 2 movies. So, in one weekend, they watch 4 movies on Saturday plus 2 movies on Sunday, making it 6 movies in total. If they keep this up for 4 weeks, they will watch 6 movies per week times 4 weeks, which equals 24 movies. 

So, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24."
"Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers. This year, he collected twice as many as last year, which is 2 times 50, so that's 100 more stickers. 

To find out how many stickers he has now, we add them all up:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

So, 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 stickers.

The total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is 250."
"Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of cat food twice a day. So, each cat eats 60 grams x 2 = 120 grams a day. With 3 cats, they eat 120 grams x 3 = 360 grams a day. If Imma has 720 grams of cat food, it will last 720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days.

So, the answer is 2 days."
"Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 10 slices, which is 3 more than Jake. So, Jake ate 7 slices. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means she ate 14 slices. 

To find the total number of slices they ate, we add up the slices each one ate:
Becky: 10 slices
Jake: 7 slices
Silvia: 14 slices

So, the total is:
10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices

The total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. To find out how long Betsy's part was, let's break it down.

First, let's say Donovan's part took \(D\) minutes. Then Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. Together, they took 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

This simplifies to:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part was 18 minutes longer, we add 18 to 40:

\[40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was 58 minutes long."
"Sure, let's add up all the costs:

1. Cast: $200
2. Doctor's visit: 30 minutes is half an hour, so it's $300 divided by 2, which is $150
3. Painkillers: 30 pills at $4 each, so that's $120
4. Parking: 2 hours at $6 each, so that's $12

Now, let's add them all up:
$200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482

So, the total cost is $482."
"James gets 80 emails every day. Out of these, 20% don't need any response. So, let's find out how many emails don't need a response:

20% of 80 is (20/100) * 80 = 16 emails

So, the emails that need a response are:

80 - 16 = 64 emails

James works 5 days a week, so the total number of emails he responds to in a week is:

64 * 5 = 320 emails

The answer is 320."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many as Monday, so that's \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many as Monday, so that's \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add them all up:

32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247.

The answer is: 247"
"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.

First, let's add up the scores:
- He scored 100 on his first test.
- He scored 100 on his second test.
- He scored 100 on his third test.
- He scored 80 on his fourth test.

So, the total score is:
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380

Now, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, the glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many they ate, we do:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
So, they ate 14 pizzas. That means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
pizzas. They ate 80% of their pizzas, so:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
pizzas were eaten. That means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas left.

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the pizzas left from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big coupon costs 15 cents.

First, let's find out how many big coupons he is sending:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for the small coupons:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the big coupons:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost:
\[ 24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, that's \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
2. Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs. So, \(7 \times 4 = 28\) meatballs.
3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, \(4 \times 4 = 16\) meatballs.
4. After Mark ate, Sidney had \(28 - 16 = 12\) meatballs left.
5. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches. So, \(3 \times 4 = 12\) more meatballs.
6. Adding the remaining meatballs and the new ones, we get \(12 + 12 = 24\) meatballs.

So, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. That means the total amount of fertiliser was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours into the delivery, 1/4 of the trucks had mechanical problems. So, the number of trucks with problems was:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This means 5 trucks couldn't deliver their load. So, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser was:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers was:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. The store has a promotion where if you buy 1 pound of butter, you get another half pound for half the price. The butter costs $4.00 per pound.

First, let's figure out the cost for 1.5 pounds of butter:
- 1 pound costs $4.00.
- Half a pound costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
- So, 1.5 pounds cost $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Now, we need to find out how many 1.5-pound sets are in 6 pounds:
- 6 pounds / 1.5 pounds per set = 4 sets.

Finally, we calculate the total cost:
- 4 sets * $6.00 per set = $24.00.

So, the total cost for Dennis to buy 6 pounds of butter is $24.00.

**Answer: $24.00**"
"Kayla is having her birthday party at a movie theater. The theater charges $125 to rent it for 20 people. For each extra person, it costs $6. Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. But 4 people couldn't come. 

First, let's count the total number of people invited:
25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 people

Since 4 people couldn't come, the number of people who will come is:
45 - 4 = 41 people

The first 20 people cost $125. The rest are 41 - 20 = 21 people. Each of these extra people costs $6, so:
21 people * $6 = $126

Now, we add the base cost and the extra cost:
$125 + $126 = $251

So, the total cost of the party is $251.

The answer is: $251"
"Maggie and Riza each have $60 left after spending some of their money. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, and Riza spent one-third of hers. We need to find out how much money they have left in total.

First, let's figure out how much money Maggie originally had. If Maggie has $60 left after spending a quarter, that means the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. So, if we let \( M \) be the original amount Maggie had, we can say:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
To find \( M \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter, she has $60 left.

Next, let's figure out how much money Riza originally had. If Riza has $60 left after spending one-third, that means the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. So, if we let \( R \) be the original amount Riza had, we can say:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
To find \( R \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

So, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas for his three monkeys for a week. 

First monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week it eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

Second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day, and in a week it eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

Now, we need to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. We know the total bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is 315. So, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total:

\[315 - 70 - 98 = 147\]

This is the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide 147 by 7:

\[147 \div 7 = 21\]

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he put in 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500 piece puzzle, so he put in 500 more pieces.

Answer: 750"
"Jenny went to the florist to buy 15 roses. Roses cost $1.25 each, and a dozen (12 roses) cost $15. First, we find the cost of 15 roses:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny brought five $5 bills, which is $25. The change she should get back is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters, we convert $6.25 to quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so that's 6 times $5.50, which equals $33. He also sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so that's 9 times $11, which equals $99. Lastly, he sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so that's 20 times $1.50, which equals $30. To find out how much money he makes in total, we add up all these amounts: $33 + $99 + $30, which equals $162.

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162."
"Paul is waiting for his train at the station. The first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes, so it leaves after 30 minutes. The second train comes 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it arrives at 40 minutes and stays for 5 minutes, leaving at 45 minutes. The third train comes an hour after the second train leaves, so it arrives at 60 minutes and leaves immediately. The fourth train comes 20 minutes after the third train leaves, so it arrives at 80 minutes. Paul will wait for 80 minutes for his train.

The answer is 80 minutes."
"Melanie has been saving toothpicks for 12 weeks, and she saves 10 toothpicks each week. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs 200 toothpicks in total. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of weeks she needs to save the remaining toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"Mr. Rogers bought a $2000 watch at 75% of its original price. So, he paid:

\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Then, he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, his friend paid:

\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

The original price of the watch was $2000, and his friend paid $1800. The discount his friend got is:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use:

\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that one spring makes one jellyfish every second. So, in one hour, which has 3600 seconds, one spring will make 3600 jellyfish.

Now, we need to find out how many jellyfish five springs will make in 4 hours. 

In one hour, five springs will make \(5 \times 3600 = 18000\) jellyfish.

Since we are looking at 4 hours, we multiply the number of jellyfish one spring makes in one hour by 4:

\(18000 \times 4 = 72000\).

So, five springs will make 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

The answer is 72000."

Answer: 1 hour"
"Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she got 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas. If she bought each banana individually at $0.80, it would cost her 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00. But she bought them in bunches for $3.00 each, so 10 bunches would cost her 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00. So, she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches. The answer is $2.00."
"Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. Let's say Sam gets \( S \) feet. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. Together they have 100 feet, so we can write:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then divide by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"A crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find out how much it grows in 1 year, we divide 8 by 4:

\[ 8 \div 4 = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Trekking Bikes**: Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   - So, \(300 \div 2 = 150\) Trekking bikes.

2. **BMX Bikes**: 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   - So, \(300 \times 0.15 = 45\) BMX bikes.

3. **MTB Bikes**: The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes.
   - So, \(300 - 150 - 45 = 105\) MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate the earnings:

1. **Earnings from Trekking Bikes**:
   - Each Trekking bike costs $450.
   - So, \(150 \times 450 = 67500\).

2. **Earnings from BMX Bikes**:
   - Each BMX bike costs half of an MTB, so \(500 \div 2 = 250\).
   - So, \(45 \times 250 = 11250\).

3. **Earnings from MTB Bikes**:
   - Each MTB bike costs $500.
   - So, \(105 \times 500 = 52500\).

Finally, let's add up all the earnings:
- \(67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250\).

So, the total earnings are \(\boxed{131250}\)."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Every hour, the farmer makes 5 bales of hay. But the truck takes away 3 bales each hour. So, the farmer is making 5 bales and the truck is taking away 3 bales, which means every hour, the field gains 2 bales (5 - 3 = 2).

If they work for 6 hours, we need to find out how many bales are left in the field. Since the field gains 2 bales each hour, over 6 hours, the field will have 12 more bales (2 bales/hour * 6 hours = 12 bales).

So, the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The answer is 12."
"John has 8 classes each day, 5 days a week. Each class is 40 minutes long. So, the total time spent in classes during the week is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

On the weekend, he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each day. So, the time spent on each day is:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra time on the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday and weekend time together gives:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many hours this is, we divide by 60:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends 6 hours a week learning."
"Nathan has a bouncy ball that bounces to two-thirds of its starting height with each bounce. He drops it from the third-floor balcony, where each story is 24 feet high. So, the ball is dropped from:

After the first bounce, the ball reaches:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

After the second bounce, the ball reaches:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

"The first child is 6 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the first child is 72 inches tall. The second child is 2 inches taller than the first, so the second child is 74 inches tall. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, so the third child is 69 inches tall. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

The height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold 2000 apples in total. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find out how much the orchard earned, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We need to figure out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so if we let the total meat be \( x \) kilograms, the T-Rex ate \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \). Multiply both sides by 4 to get \( x = 270 \times 4 = 1080 \).

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The answer is: 1080."
"To figure out how much it will cost to paint the room, we need to find out the total area of the walls and then calculate how many gallons of paint are needed.

First, let's find the area of the north and south walls. Each of these walls is 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.

Next, let's find the area of the east and west walls. Each of these walls is 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area of one wall is \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together to get the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Since one gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we need to find out how many gallons are needed to cover 240 square feet. We do this by dividing the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

If one gallon of paint costs $12, then the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

So, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

Ellen started with 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself, so now we have:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 12 - 1 = 11

Ellen's brother came and took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. So now we have:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 11 - 2 = 9

Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 2 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas left. The total number of sodas left is 2 + 9 = 11.

The chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas. So, it's:
\[ \frac{2}{11} \]

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{2}{11} \times 100 \approx 18.18\% \]

So, the chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is about 18.18%. If you need to choose from options, it would be closest to 18%."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

The first train is going 60 miles every hour. So in 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

The second train is going half the speed of the first train, so it's going:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \div 2 = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \]
In 3 hours, it will travel:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how far apart they are after 3 hours, we add the distances they've traveled:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \]

So, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many days there are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, that's 31 days. From April 1st to April 19th, that's 19 days. So, the total number of days is 31 + 19 = 50 days.

Next, Billy takes 20% of these days off. To find out how many days he takes off, we calculate 20% of 50. That's 0.20 * 50 = 10 days. So, he works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. So, he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day he works.

Now, to find out how many people he helps in 40 days, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works. That's 6 * 40 = 240 people.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"I'm not sure I understand the question fully. It seems like there's some information about a wedding and some vehicles, but I'm not clear on what the final answer should be. Could you please give me more details or clarify what you're asking? 

If you're asking how many people could have been transported by the vehicles, then we can calculate that. There were 12 buses, and each bus could carry 35 people, so that's 12 times 35, which is 420 people. There were also 20 cars, and each car could carry 3 people, so that's 20 times 3, which is 60 people. If we add those together, we get 420 plus 60, which equals 480 people. 

So, the answer could be 480 people. But I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for. Could you give me more details?"
"Mike is 24 years old. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.

The answer is 30."
"To figure out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to do some simple math.

For the biggest slide:
- It's 300 feet long and people go down at 60 feet per minute.
- So, the time it takes is 300 feet divided by 60 feet per minute, which equals 5 minutes.

For the second biggest slide:
- It's 240 feet long and people go down at 80 feet per minute.
- So, the time it takes is 240 feet divided by 80 feet per minute, which equals 3 minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer the biggest slide takes:
- We subtract the time for the second slide from the time for the biggest slide.
- That is 5 minutes minus 3 minutes, which equals 2 minutes.

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

2 minutes"
"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day. So, each day he spends 30 minutes on lunch and 30 minutes on breaks, which is 60 minutes total. Since 60 minutes is 1 hour, over 5 days, he spends 5 hours on his lunch and breaks.

So, the answer is 5 hours."
"Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran \(3.5 \times 8 = 28\) miles. Together, Amber and Micah ran \(8 + 28 = 36\) miles. Since they all ran 52 miles in total, Ahito must have run \(52 - 36 = 16\) miles.

So, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

1. Sheila first charged $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returned an item that cost $15.00, so we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]
3. She then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]
   Then we subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00
   \]
4. She also bought a set of towels that was on sale for 10% off $30.00. First, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00
   \]
   Then we subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]
5. We add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels:
   \[
   16.00 + 27.00 = 43.00
   \]
6. Finally, we add the total new purchases to the remaining balance after the return:
   \[
   70.00 + 43.00 = 113.00
   \]

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is:
\[
\boxed{113.00}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of those large jellyfish change color when a UV light is turned on. We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color.

First, let's figure out how many large jellyfish there are. If a third of the large jellyfish change color and that number is 6, then the total number of large jellyfish must be 3 times 6, which is 18.

Now, since the large jellyfish make up a fifth of all the jellyfish, we can say that if 18 is a fifth of the total, then the total number of jellyfish must be 5 times 18. So, 5 times 18 is 90.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

So, the answer is: 90."
"Chris is 4 years old. Ben is twice as old as Chris, so Ben is 8 years old. Caroline is three times as old as Ben, so Caroline is 24 years old.

Answer: Caroline is 24 years old."
"To figure out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we need to do some simple math.

First, we find out how much money Lauren needs each year in retirement. She wants to live on 40% of her current salary, which is $100,000. So, we calculate 40% of $100,000:

\[ 40\% \times 100,000 = 40,000 \]

So, Lauren needs $40,000 each year in retirement.

Next, we need to know how many years she plans to live in retirement. She plans to live for 20 years. So, we multiply the yearly amount by 20:

\[ 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \]

This means Lauren needs $800,000 saved for her retirement.

Now, we need to find out how much Lauren saves each year. She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary. So, we calculate 20% of $100,000:

\[ 20\% \times 100,000 = 20,000 \]

So, Lauren saves $20,000 each year.

To find out how many years she needs to save $800,000, we divide the total amount needed by the amount she saves each year:

\[ 800,000 \div 20,000 = 40 \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.

The answer is 40 years."
"Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to cut it into 4 equal parts. So, we divide 100 by 4:

100 ÷ 4 = 25

Each of these parts is 25 centimeters long. Now, he needs to divide each 25-centimeter part into 5 equal parts. So, we divide 25 by 5:

25 ÷ 5 = 5

Each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

The answer is 5 centimeters."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. To find the total number of students in the school, we need to figure out what 100% would be. 

If 40% is 240, then 1% would be 240 divided by 40. So, 1% is 6. Now, to find 100%, we multiply 6 by 100, which gives us 600. So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Now, we know that 40% are boys, so the rest, which is 60%, must be girls. To find out how many girls there are, we take 60% of 600. 

60% of 600 is the same as multiplying 600 by 0.60 (which is the decimal form of 60%). So, 600 times 0.60 is 360. 

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to add the cost of the pots and the cost of the garden soil:
- Pots cost $19
- Garden soil cost $26

So, $19 + $26 = $45

Next, we use the coupon which gives us $7 off:
- Total cost before coupon: $45
- Coupon value: $7

So, $45 - $7 = $38

Therefore, the amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is: $38"
"To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to do some simple math.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Adding these together, the total height is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we find the average by dividing the total height by the number of women:
- There are 6 women in total.
- So, the average height is \(18 \div 6 = 3\) inches.

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. 

First, let's find out how many miles she plans to hike each day:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to finish 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time. The answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the money made from selling the red balls. There are 3 red balls and each one costs $9. So, \(3 \times 9 = 27\).

Next, we calculate the money from the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls and each one costs $5. So, \(11 \times 5 = 55\).

Then, we calculate the money from the green balls. There are 25 green balls and each one costs $3. So, \(25 \times 3 = 75\).

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total money made. So, \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\).

Therefore, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) after all the balls are sold."
"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, which is 3 kg, and Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is 4 kg. Together, they want 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg. So, the apples left for Jacques (or James) will be 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

The answer is 5 kg."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees. It went down by 8 degrees, so it became -6 degrees. Then it went up by 3 degrees, making it -3 degrees. So, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Raymond starts with $21. He then saves $11, so he has $21 + $11 = $32. He spends $5 on a comic book, so he has $32 - $5 = $27. He then spends $19 on a puzzle, so he has $27 - $19 = $8 left. 

The final amount of money Raymond has left is $8."
"Anna had a budget of $16 and has $2 left after buying some books. She spent $4 before buying the 2 books today. So, the total amount spent on the books is $16 - $2 - $4 = $10. Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same, each book cost $10 ÷ 2 = $5.

The cost of each book is $5."
"Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class. This year, there are more students because the number increased by 20%. To find out how many more students that is, we take 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 is:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, 10 more students joined this year. Adding these 10 students to last year's 50 students gives us:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class."
"To figure out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to know how often it blinks. We know it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. So, we divide 255 by 5 to find out how many times it blinks in one minute:

\[ 255 \div 5 = 51 \]

This means the light blinks 51 times every minute. Now, we need to find out how long it will take for it to blink 459 times. We do this by dividing 459 by 51:

\[ 459 \div 51 = 9 \]

So, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we start with the fish Tate already has:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

Then, Tate buys more fish:
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's add the new fish to the old ones:
- Total male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Total female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Total male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Total female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Next, we add up all the male and female fish:
- Total male fish: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fish: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

Finally, we find out how many more female fish there are than male fish:
- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.

**Final Answer: 5**"
"Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia, so she spent 4 + 2 = 6 hours walking the dog. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia, so she spent 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 hours doing laundry. Adding all the times together, we get 4 + 6 + 9 = 19 hours. So, the total time they all took to do their chores is 19 hours."
"John visits his parents twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to drive there at 70 miles per hour. For a round trip, he drives 280 miles each time (2 hours × 70 mph × 2). Since he visits twice a month, he drives 560 miles in total (280 miles × 2 visits). So, the answer is 560 miles."
"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. So in 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that 5 workers are making toys. 2 workers make 6 toys each per hour, so together they make \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour. Another 2 workers make 4 toys each per hour, so together they make \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour. So, the first 4 workers together make \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the first 4 workers together make \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order. This means the 5 workers together made \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Since the first 4 workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide the total toys made by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked: \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker makes 18 toys per hour.

The answer is: \(\boxed{18}\)"
"Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 15 pounds (60 divided by 4). Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 30 pounds (60 divided by 2). To find the total weight, we add all the weights together: 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds.

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 105 pounds."
"Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. 

Let's figure out how many stickers Seth had at the start:

1. Kris had 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris, so Luis must have had 16 stickers before giving them to Kris.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the other half to Kris, so Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

\[

"John bought 3 large bags of M&M, each weighing 10 ounces. So, he has 3 * 10 = 30 ounces in total. If 1 ounce has 30 M&M, then 30 ounces will have 30 * 30 = 900 M&M. If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, then he can make 900 / 10 = 90 small bags.

So, the answer is 90."
"Alfie, the albatross, flies 400 kilometers every day. The distance around the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Half of that distance is 20,000 kilometers. To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide 20,000 by 400. 

So, \( \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \) days.

The answer is 50 days."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply 120 by 5:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply 600 by 1.25:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ \boxed{750} \]"
"Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, he was 14. At that time, his age was twice Vince's age. So, if Liam was 14, then Vince was 14 divided by 2, which is 7. Now, two years have passed, so Vince is 7 plus 2, which makes him 9 years old.

The answer is 9."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. So, if Arnold painted \(A\) eggs, Madeline also painted \(A\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs. If Camden painted \(C\) eggs, Sarah painted \(S\) eggs, and \(C + S = 30\).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. So, \(C = S + 12\).

Now, let's find out how many eggs Sarah painted. We know:
\[C + S = 30\]
\[C = S + 12\]

Substitute \(C\) in the first equation:
\[(S + 12) + S = 30\]
\[2S + 12 = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Now, we can find out how many eggs Camden painted:
\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]

Now, we know Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and the total number of eggs painted is 56. So:
\[A + A + 21 + 9 = 56\]
\[2A + 30 = 56\]
\[2A = 26\]
\[A = 13\]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs. Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[C - A = 21 - 13 = 8\]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them into groups of 8 and put each group into a box. Each box weighs 8 ounces and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's find out how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make:
\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]
So, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ 400 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"John cuts down a tree that is 80 feet tall. He can make logs from 80% of it, so he uses 64 feet (80 * 0.80 = 64). He cuts these into 4-foot logs, so he gets 16 logs (64 / 4 = 16). From each log, he cuts 5 planks, so he gets 80 planks (16 * 5 = 80). He sells each plank for $1.2, so he makes $96 (80 * 1.2 = 96).

The answer is \(\boxed{96}\)."
"Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice as much, so he earns $5000 \times 2 = $10000 per month. Together, Valerie and her brother earn $5000 + $10000 = $15000 per month. Their mother earns twice what they both earn together, so she earns $15000 \times 2 = $30000 per month. Adding all their earnings together, we get $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 per month. 

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"Grandma walks 3 miles every day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. It takes her 40 minutes to walk on the beach. On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the speed, so it takes her 10 minutes. So, the total time she takes to walk 3 miles is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

The answer is 50 minutes."
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks. So, she has saved:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She wants to save a total of $60. So, she needs to save:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, she will need:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Okay, let's count the blue birds step by step.

First, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

And finally, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
\[ 3 \]

Now, we add all these together:
\[ 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 \]

So, the total number of blue birds is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is 24 (because 1 dozen is 12), we can find out how many marbles he originally has by subtracting 24 from 60.

So, \(60 - 24 = 36\). This means Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, if Bob loses 10 of his marbles, we need to subtract 10 from the 36 marbles he has.

So, \(36 - 10 = 26\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug has an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle, he is now able to drink the water. 

To find out the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to make sure the mixture in the water bottle is at least 40 degrees. 

Let's say the temperature of the second mug is \( T \) degrees. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the average of the temperatures of the two mugs, considering the volume of each. So, we have:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we start with 50 cows and 20 chickens.

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows each day for 21 days (3 weeks), so that's 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens each day for 21 days, so that's 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens.

Now, we add these to the initial numbers:

Cows: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
Chickens: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

So, the total number of animals is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"Russell orders his favorite bagels online. Each pack has 9 bagels and costs $10.00. If he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount. First, we find out how much 4 packs cost without the discount:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the discount:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Russell gets 4 packs, and each pack has 9 bagels:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per single bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

First, Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we do 23 - 5 = 18 scoops.

Next, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This means 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 3 - 1 = 2 scoops. So, for 1 scoop, it takes 3 / 2 = 1.5 potatoes.

Now, if Gomer ate 18 scoops, we multiply 18 by 1.5 to find out how many potatoes he ate. So, 18 * 1.5 = 27 potatoes.

So, the answer is 27 potatoes."
"Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so that's 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs. Then, he eats 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, which is 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs. Adding these together, Chester eats 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs in 60 days. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide 240 eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens that is. So, 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens. 

The answer is 20 dozens."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. First, we know there are 17 green jelly beans. The problem says there are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones, so we multiply 17 by 2 to get the number of red jelly beans:
\[ 17 \times 2 = 34 \]

Now, we add the green and red jelly beans together:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 60. To find out how many are blue, we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Tim grows 5 trees. Each tree gives him 6 lemons every year. So, in one year, he gets 5 trees times 6 lemons, which is 30 lemons. Now, a decade is 10 years, so in 10 years, he would get 30 lemons times 10, which is 300 lemons.

The answer is 300 lemons."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we know the ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

The total number of passengers is 84. If we let the number of men be 5x and the number of women be 9x, then:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]

This simplifies to:

\[14x = 84\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[x = \frac{84}{14} = 6\]

So, the number of men is:

\[5x = 5 \times 6 = 30\]

And the number of women is:

\[9x = 9 \times 6 = 54\]

Now, if 20 women get off the bus, the number of women remaining is:

\[54 - 20 = 34\]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

The final answer is:

\[\boxed{34}\]"
"Faraday sells sunflowers and bouquets of sunflowers. Each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8. He earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets each day. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

First, let's find out how many individual sunflowers he sells each day:
- He earns $26 from individual sunflowers, and each sunflower costs $2.
- So, the number of individual sunflowers sold each day is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).

Next, let's find out how many bouquets he sells each day:
- He earns $56 from bouquets, and each bouquet costs $8.
- So, the number of bouquets sold each day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \).

Now, let's find out how many sunflowers are in the bouquets he sells each day:
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.
- So, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold each day is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \).

Now, let's find out the total number of sunflowers sold each day:
- The total number of sunflowers sold each day is \( 13 + 84 = 97 \).

Finally, let's find out the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
- The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291."
"Adam has $100 to spend on rocks. Each rock costs $5, so he can buy 20 rocks because 100 divided by 5 is 20. He sells 60% of his rocks, which is 12 rocks because 20 times 0.60 is 12. Each rock is sold for $7, so he makes $84 from selling 12 rocks because 12 times 7 is 84. He started with $100 and ended up with $84, so he lost $16 because 100 minus 84 is 16.

The answer is: \boxed{16}"
"Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes in one day. She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes, so that will take her:
\[ \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days} \]

For the medium-sized scenes, she can draw 6 per day. She needs to draw 36, so that will take:
\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ days} \]

For the small-sized scenes, she can draw 7 per day. She needs to draw 49, so that will take:
\[ \frac{49}{7} = 7 \text{ days} \]

Adding all the days together:
\[ 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to draw all the scenes."
"Chatty made 3 dozen eggs for her 4 children. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen would be 36 eggs. If she divides 36 eggs equally among her 4 children, each child would get 9 eggs. So, the answer is 9 eggs per child."
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 worth of food a day. To find out how much she spends on food in May, we need to know how many days are in May. May has 31 days. 

So, the daily cost for all the fish is:
\[ 3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish} = \$3 \text{ per day} \]

Now, to find the total cost for May:
\[ \$3 \text{ per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93 \]

So, Jen spends \$93 on food for her fish in May."
"Patricia started with 30 roses. She gave 24 to her mother, so she had 30 - 24 = 6 roses left. Then she bought 15 more roses, so she now has 6 + 15 = 21 roses. The answer is 21."
"To find out Sid's average speed, we need to add up all the miles he traveled and all the time he spent traveling.

First, Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours. Then, he traveled another 140 miles in 3 hours.

So, the total distance traveled is:
110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

The total time spent traveling is:
2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
250 miles ÷ 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

So, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know that the chance of winning with the first ticket is 20%. That's like saying out of 100 tickets, 20 of them win.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win. So, if the first one has a 20% chance, the second one has 3 times that, which is 60%. That's like saying out of 100 tickets, 60 of them win.

Now, to find the chance that both tickets win, we multiply the chances together. So, we take 20% (or 0.20) and multiply it by 60% (or 0.60).

\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Jim collected 27 seashells. Carlos collected 5 less than Jim, so Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells. Carrey collected half as many as Carlos, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells. Together, they collected 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells. They divided the seashells equally, so each got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

Each person got 20 seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, he eats \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots during the weekdays. On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day, which is 2 days. So, he eats \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots on the weekend. Adding these together, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots in a week.

The answer is 30."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is longer than the first one. To find out how much longer, we need to calculate 60% of 5 minutes. 

60% of 5 minutes is 0.60 times 5, which is 3 minutes. So, the second song is 5 minutes plus 3 minutes, which makes it 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the time of both songs together:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"Linus works for a company that sells mobile devices. He buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice that amount. So, the selling price is $40.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, and last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices. So, the total number of devices he bought is 2 + 4 = 6 devices.

The cost of each device is $20, so the total cost for 6 devices is 6 × $20 = $120.

He sold each device for $40, so the total revenue from selling 6 devices is 6 × $40 = $240.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. So, the profit is $240 - $120 = $120.

The answer is $120."
"Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Ned, and Ned is two feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel. Isabel is 7 feet tall.

First, let's find out how tall Ned is:
Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so:
7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet. So, Ned is 5 feet tall.

Next, let's find out how tall Carl is:
Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so:
5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet. So, Carl is 6 feet tall.

Now, let's find out how long Carl's cane is:
Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so:
6 feet / 2 = 3 feet. So, Carl's cane is 3 feet long.

The answer is 3 feet."
"To help 2300 people get all the energy they need from carrot juice, we need to figure out how many bottles of juice are needed. Each bottle gives enough energy for 20% of one person's needs, so to cover 100%, we need 5 bottles per person. For 2300 people, that's 2300 times 5, which is 11500 bottles.

Hortex makes 4200 bottles each day. To find out how many more bottles they need to make, we subtract the number they already make from the total needed. So, 11500 minus 4200 is 7300.

The answer is 7300 more bottles."
"Carla just had 8 identical octuplets. She dressed 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue. So, the number of octuplets in purple is 6 (since 3/4 of 8 is 6) and the number in blue is 2 (since 1/4 of 8 is 2).

All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows. So, all 2 blue-wearers wear bows, and 1/3 of the 6 purple-wearers, which is 2, also wear bows.

The total number of bow-wearers is 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4.

Now, we want to know the chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. There are 2 purple-wearers wearing bows out of a total of 4 bow-wearers. So, the chance is 2 out of 4, which is 1/2.

To make it a percentage, we multiply 1/2 by 100, which gives us 50%.

So, the answer is 50%."
"Last week, the IRS got 5168 tax reports. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. To find out how many reports they got on Wednesday, we need to do some math.

First, we subtract the reports from Monday and Tuesday from the total:
5168 - 1907 = 3261

Then, we subtract the reports from Thursday and Friday from the remaining number:
3261 - 2136 = 1125

So, the number of reports they got on Wednesday is 1125.

The answer is 1125."
"Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it for $50. So, he sells 40 square meters for $50. Then, he sells another 1/4 of the remaining land for $30. That means he sells 10 square meters for $30. The remaining land is 30 square meters, and he sells it for $3 per square meter, which gives him $90. So, the total money he earns is $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

The correct answer is: $170."
"Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. Haley is 26 years old. Half of Haley's age is 26 divided by 2, which is 13. Then, 10 less than 13 is 3. So, Geb is 3 years old. The answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 3 dozen would be \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Next, Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy found \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so Mei found \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs found:
Lamar: 5 eggs
Stacy: 10 eggs
Charlie: 8 eggs
Mei: 4 eggs

So, \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\) eggs were found in total.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total found from the initial number of eggs:
\(36 - 27 = 9\)

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so together they have:

\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than 400 apartments. So, we calculate 60% of 400:

\[0.60 \times 400 = 240\]

Now, we add this to the 400 apartments to get the total for the third complex:

\[400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Next, we add the apartments from all three complexes:

\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:

\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

So, the answer is:

\[\boxed{1248}\]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount, so that's \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount, so that's \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. If a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits (since it's 20 times the initial amount, \(20 \times 50 = 1000\)), then an 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. A 9-year-old avocado tree produces 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

Answer: $120"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

1. We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope. So if the blue rope is \( B \) centimeters, the red rope is \( 4B \) centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. So if the yellow rope is \( Y \) centimeters, the blue rope is \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.
3. The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. So we have \( 4B + B + Y = 37 \).

Now, let's find the lengths:
- Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the total length equation.
- So, \( 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \).
- This simplifies to \( 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \).
- Combining like terms, we get \( 6Y - 35 = 37 \).
- Adding 35 to both sides, we get \( 6Y = 72 \).
- Dividing by 6, we get \( Y = 12 \).

Now we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. So the blue rope is \( 12 - 7 = 5 \) centimeters. And the red rope is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) centimeters.

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The answer is: \(\boxed{20}\)"
"Ronnie got $5 and Rissa got three times that, so Rissa got $15. After giving some money to their little sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. That means Rissa gave away 1/5 of her money. Since 1/5 of $15 is $3, Rissa gave $3 to her sister. So, Rissa has $15 - $3 = $12 left. 

Ronnie also gave $3 to his sister, so he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

The amount of money left with Ronnie is $2.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the area of one bedroom. The bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:
\[ 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. To find the total area of the house, we add these areas together:
\[ 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is:

"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know a regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. Now, there's a special box that costs the same $12 but has 20% more pods.

To find out how many pods are in the special box, we calculate 20% of 100 pods:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

So, the special box has:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

Now, we need to find out how much each pod costs in the special box. Since the special box costs $12 and has 120 pods, we divide $12 by 120:

\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \]

This means each pod in the special box costs $0.10. Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, for $1, you can run:

\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \]

So, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.

The answer is: \boxed{10}"
"Thomas takes out $1000 in 20 dollar bills. That means he gets 50 bills because 1000 divided by 20 is 50. 

On the way home, he loses 10 bills, so he has 40 left. 

He uses half of these 40 bills to pay a bill, which is 20 bills. So, he has 20 bills left. 

He then triples the money he has left, which is 20 times 20, so he has 400 dollars. Tripling that gives him 1200 dollars. 

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. Since 1200 divided by 5 is 240, he ends up with 240 five dollar bills.

"In the first half, Team A scored 4 goals and Team B scored 2 goals fewer, so Team B scored 2 goals. That's 4 goals for Team A and 2 goals for Team B.

In the second half, Team B scored 4 times the goals they scored in the first half, so Team B scored \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals. Team A scored \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the goals Team B scored in the second half, so Team A scored \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

So, in total, Team A scored \(4 + 2 = 6\) goals and Team B scored \(2 + 8 = 10\) goals. The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk. On Monday, he used 45% of it, so he used \(5 \times 0.45 = 2.25\) inches. That means he has \(5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches left.

Each day, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

- After the first day, he uses \(2.75 \times 0.20 = 0.55\) inches, so he has \(2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20\) inches left.
- After the second day, he uses \(2.20 \times 0.20 = 0.44\) inches, so he has \(2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76\) inches left.
- After the third day, he uses \(1.76 \times 0.20 = 0.352\) inches, so he has \(1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408\) inches left.
- After the fourth day, he uses \(1.408 \times 0.20 = 0.2816\) inches, so he has \(1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264\) inches left.
- After the fifth day, he uses \(1.1264 \times 0.20 = 0.22528\) inches, so he has \(1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112\) inches left.

Since \(0.90112\) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 girls. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 12 divided by 4, which is 3 boys. So, 4 girls plus 3 boys on varsity makes 7 students on varsity. The total number of students is 12 boys plus 12 girls, which is 24. If 7 students are on varsity, then 24 minus 7 is 17 students not on varsity. So, the answer is 17."

"James has 30 teeth. The dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more than he drills. So, the dentist caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. In total, the dentist fixes 4 + 11 = 15 teeth. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we divide the number of fixed teeth by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100. So, (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%. 

The answer is 50%."
"Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. The total cost was:

\[ 4000 \times 3.5 = 14000 \]

But 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date. So, the amount of sour milk is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \]

The refund for the sour milk is:

\[ 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \]

So, the refund amount is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, let's say Colin's current age is \( C \).

The problem says Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. So, in seven years, Colin will be \( C + 7 \) years old. Wendy's age is five times that, so Wendy's age is \( 5(C + 7) \).

The problem also says that in 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's current age. In 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old. So, \( C + 25 \) is a third of Wendy's current age, which is \( W \). This means \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \).

Now, we know Wendy's age is \( 5(C + 7) \), so we can substitute that into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \]

Let's solve this step by step:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 2C + 35 \]
Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[ 40 = 2C \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many sets of 100 books Bob can buy with $27000. Since 100 books cost $500, we divide $27000 by $500:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Now, we need to find out the total number of books he can buy:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Now, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Okay, let's think through this step by step:

1. Two apples fell from the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. So, Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, which made five more apples fall. Now, Newton has one apple in his pocket and five apples on the ground. He picks up the five apples, so he has six apples in total.
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has five apples in his pocket and one apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, which makes six more apples fall. Now, Newton has five apples in his pocket and six apples on the ground. He picks up all six apples, so he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.

So, the number of apples Newton brought home is 11.

The answer is: 11"
"To find out how much Ali's coal order will cost, we need to figure out how many 50 kg bags he needs for 850 kg of coal and then multiply that by the cost per bag.

First, we calculate the number of bags:
\[ \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many slices of each type of pizza Kate's friends will eat. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. Since there are 6 friends, we can calculate the total slices needed for each type of pizza.

For cheese pizza:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

For pepperoni pizza:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole pizzas are required for each type. Cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizza pies and 3 pepperoni pizza pies. That means she needs to buy a total of:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final answer: \(\boxed{6}\)"
"Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles each day for 3 days, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 miles.

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. That's 5 miles each day for 2 days, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 miles.

Now, we add the miles from both parts together: 9 miles plus 10 miles equals 19 miles.

So, Sam ran 19 miles this week."
"To figure out how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, let's break it down simply.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. First, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay makes in 15 minutes. Since there are 4 sets of 15 minutes in an hour, Jay makes 20 ÷ 4 = 5 snowballs in 15 minutes. But 2 snowballs melt, so the net gain is 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take to get 60 snowballs. Since Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we divide 60 by 3 to find the number of 15-minute intervals: 60 ÷ 3 = 20 intervals.

Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time is 20 × 15 = 300 minutes. To convert this into hours, we divide 300 by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 300 ÷ 60 = 5 hours.

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer: 5 hours**"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step. Digimon came out 20 years ago. John is 28 years old now. If we go back 20 years, John would be 8 years old. The problem says that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 8, Jim must have been half of that, which is 4 years old. Now, if 20 years have passed since then, Jim would be 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

So, Jim is 24 years old now."

"On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one pack of 50, so they had 12 bandages left. On the second day, they used 28 bandages and ordered 50 more, so they had 34 bandages. On the third day, they used 25 bandages and ordered 100 more, ending up with 109 bandages. But they only had 78 bandages left, so they must have started with 34 bandages on the first day.

The correct answer is: \boxed{34}"
"Sure, let's figure out the cost of May's haircut and color.

First, we need to find out how much the haircut cost. Her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so she had 2 inches cut off. The cost for cutting 1 inch is $30, so for 2 inches, it would be \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

Next, we add the cost of the color, which is $40.

So, the total cost is \(60 + 40 = 100\) dollars.

"Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. She works for 4 weeks in April, so she works 24 days in total. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so she earns $11.25 each day. For 24 days, she earns $270. Since she had no absences, she gets an extra $10. So, her total earnings for April are $280.

The final answer is: $280."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

For emptying the dishwasher, Jason did it 6 times and gets $0.50 each time. So, \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\).

For doing his laundry, he did it once and gets $3.00. So, \(1 \times 3.00 = 3.00\).

For taking the trash out, he did it twice and gets $0.75 each time. So, \(2 \times 0.75 = 1.50\).

For cleaning his room, he did it once and gets $1.50. So, \(1 \times 1.50 = 1.50\).

Now, let's add all these up: \(3.00 + 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 = 9.00\).

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. First, we know that a whale has 40 gallons of blood. Now, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, we need to multiply 40 gallons by 3 to find out how much blood a shark has:

\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since one shark has 120 gallons, we multiply 120 gallons by 10:

\[ 120 \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people came to the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people came.
3. After some time, twice the number of people who came at 10:00 came. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people came.
4. By evening, 3 times the number of people who came in the morning came. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people came.

Now, let's add them all up:

\[
50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
\]

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. Each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. So, the number of black pens is:
\[ 2 \times 25 \text{ red pens} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find the total number of pens, we add the red pens and the black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the total number of pens Alain has is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. That means each bottle of scotch costs $60 because \(600 \div 10 = 60\).

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 20 bottles of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more per bottle than the scotch. Since each bottle of scotch costs $60, 50% more would be \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\). So, each bottle of cognac costs $90.

Now, to find out how much he spends on the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: \(20 \times 90 = 1800\).

To find the total amount he spends, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac: \(600 + 1800 = 2400\).

So, the total amount John spends on everything is $2400.

"On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 40. So, on the first day, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, making it 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 40 + 10 = 50. So, on the second day, he planted 30 + 50 = 80 trees.

Adding the trees from both days, we get 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140."

His friend Ronnie took 5 gallons, so he had 13 - 5 = 8 gallons left. On the fourth day, 3 people, including Fred, came to the party. They shared the 8 gallons equally, so each got 8 ÷ 3 gallons. The answer is \(\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}\) gallons."
"Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

The problem says that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40. We need to find out how many coffee mugs are there.

Let's say the number of coffee mugs is \( x \).

So, four times the number of coffee mugs is \( 4x \).

And eight more than that is \( 4x + 8 \).

According to the problem, this equals 40. So we can write it as:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \).

First, we subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 8.

The answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

First, we have 66 fish in total. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, we calculate one-third of 66:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after removing the 22 fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 44 fish have blue stripes. The problem says that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate \( \frac{5}{11} \) of 44:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is 42."
"Amy had 2 eyeshadow palettes with 4 colors each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 colors. She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 colors. Altogether, she had 8 + 18 = 26 colors. Her sister took one palette, which had 4 colors, so now she has 26 - 4 = 22 colors. Amy used half of the colors from one makeup set, which means she used 6 / 2 = 3 colors. So, from the makeup set, she has 6 - 3 = 3 colors left. Therefore, the total number of colors she has left is 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

The final answer is 19."
"Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times his height, so the house is 60 inches times 7, which equals 420 inches. The first floor to the ceiling is 3 times Mattison's height, so it's 60 inches times 3, which equals 180 inches. The height from the second floor to the roof is the total height of the house minus the height of the first floor to the ceiling. So, 420 inches minus 180 inches equals 240 inches. 

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."

"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We know Bernie has 4 dogs and they need a total of 3 miles of exercise on average each day. That means all the dogs together need 12 miles of exercise per day (3 miles times 4 dogs).

Now, let's add up the miles for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

So, 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles for the first three dogs.

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the miles for the first three dogs from the total miles needed:
12 miles (total) - 8 miles (first three dogs) = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day."
"John got a loan by mortgaging his home. His house is worth $250,000. He got a loan worth 40% of that, so:

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

The correct answer is: \boxed{64}"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Trinity sells the magazines for. She sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72.

To find the selling price, we multiply $72 by \( \frac{11}{8} \):

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we need to find out her profit. Profit is the selling price minus the buying price:

\[ 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, her profit is $27.

"Brian used a dehumidifier to remove water from his basement. The dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high. 

- On the low setting, it removes 1 liter of water per day.
- On the medium setting, it removes twice as much as the low setting, so it removes 2 liters per day.
- On the high setting, it removes twice as much as the medium setting, so it removes 4 liters per day.

Brian used the dehumidifier for:
- 3 days on the low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\)
- 3 days on the medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\)
- 5 days on the high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\)

Adding these together, the total amount of water removed is:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters."
"Jolene and her friends filled 10 packs of water balloons, with 30 balloons in each pack. So, the total number of balloons they filled is 10 packs times 30 balloons per pack, which equals 300 balloons. By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the 12 balloons left from the total 300 balloons. So, 300 balloons minus 12 balloons equals 288 balloons thrown.

The number of balloons thrown is 288."

"Tim entered a competition where he had to guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar. The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches at the base and 15 inches tall. He knows each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches and they fit about 80% efficiently. He thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red. The actual number of red jelly beans is 900.

First, let's find the volume of the jar:
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we calculate the effective volume for packing the jelly beans:
\[ \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, we find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar:
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \]

Tim estimates that 30% of these jelly beans are red:
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \]

The actual number of red jelly beans is 900. So, how far off was his guess?
\[ \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. The bus can hold 200 people.
2. When it left Chengli city, there were 20 people on the bus.
3. At the first stop, 40 more people got on. So now there are \(20 + 40 = 60\) people on the bus.
4. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop got on again. So \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\) more people got on. Now there are \(60 + 30 = 90\) people on the bus.
5. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubled. So now there are \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people on the bus.
6. The bus can hold 200 people, so the number of empty seats is \(200 - 180 = 20\).

So, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%, so the new cost is $2 plus 150% of $2. That means the new cost is $2 plus $3, which is $5.

In 5 years, she visited the museum 15 times (3 visits/year * 5 years). In the next 3 years, she visited 9 more times (3 visits/year * 3 years). So, in total, she visited 24 times.

Since each visit now costs $5, the total amount she spent is 24 visits * $5/visit = $120.

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $120."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how many students get to try the escape room. There are 4 grades, and each grade has 10 students who get to try it. So, we multiply 4 by 10:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Next, we need to find out how many groups of 8 students can be formed from these 40 students. We divide 40 by 8:

\[ 40 \div 8 = 5 \]

Each group gets 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group gets:

\[ 5 \times 45 = 225 \]

So, it will take 225 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. To find out how much Ali has to pay John, we need to do some simple math.

For the tables:
4 tables × $20/table = $80

For the roof frames:
2 frames × $10/frame = $20

Now, we add the two amounts together:
$80 + $20 = $100

So, Ali has to pay John $100.

The answer is: $100."
"Ian has a board that is 40 feet long. He cuts it into two pieces, where the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece. Let's figure out how long the longer piece is.

If we say the shorter piece is \(x\) feet, then the longer piece is \(4x\) feet. Together, they make up the whole board, so:
\[x + 4x = 40\]

This simplifies to:
\[5x = 40\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 5:
\[x = \frac{40}{5} = 8\]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the shorter piece, is:
\[4 \times 8 = 32\]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

**Answer: 32 feet**"
"Aiden is making his famous steakhouse-seasoned meatballs for a neighborhood cookout. He uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef. He can make 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. If he wants to make 80 meatballs, we need to figure out how much of his secret seasoning he will need.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs to make 80 meatballs. Since he can make 16 meatballs from 1 pound of ground beef, we can calculate the pounds of ground beef needed as follows:

\[ \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much of his secret seasoning he will need for 5 pounds of ground beef. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of ground beef, we can calculate the amount of seasoning needed as follows:

\[ \text{Secret seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need \(\boxed{10}\) tablespoons of his secret seasoning to make 80 meatballs."
"Luke needs to buy fabric for five windows. Each window is 35 inches wide. So, the total width of the windows is 5 times 35 inches. That's 175 inches. But Luke needs 2 times the total width, so he needs 2 times 175 inches, which is 350 inches. So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric."
"To figure out the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it into two parts because the price changes after 16 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, it costs $0.25 per minute. So, we multiply 16 by $0.25:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \]
So, the first 16 minutes cost $4.

For the remaining 20 minutes (since 36 - 16 = 20), it costs $0.20 per minute. So, we multiply 20 by $0.20:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]
So, the remaining 20 minutes cost $4.

Now, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.

The final answer is $8."
"On Monday, it rained 2 inches. On Tuesday, it's expected to rain 1 inch more than twice the amount of Monday. Twice the amount of Monday's rain is 2 times 2, which is 4 inches. So, on Tuesday, it's expected to rain 4 plus 1, which is 5 inches.

Answer: 5 inches"
"Carly is making treats for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Her class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. We need to find out how many cupcakes Carly made.

Let's say the number of cupcakes is \( c \). Then the number of brownies is \( 3c - 2 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, which is \( c + (3c - 2) \). This should equal the total number of treats, which is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

So, we have:
\[ c + 3c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4c = 12 \]
\[ c = 3 \]

Therefore, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out the cost after the discount for both the manicure and pedicure.
   - A manicure costs $35, and with a 20% discount, it becomes $35 - (20% of $35) = $35 - $7 = $28.
   - A pedicure costs $40, and with a 20% discount, it becomes $40 - (20% of $40) = $40 - $8 = $32.
   - So, the total cost for both is $28 + $32 = $60.

2. Next, we need to calculate the cost of nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.
   - Nail art costs $3 per nail, and there are 10 nails for each, so for both, it's 20 nails.
   - The total cost for nail art is 20 nails * $3 per nail = $60.

3. Finally, we add the cost of the discounted manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.
   - The total cost is $60 (manicure and pedicure) + $60 (nail art) = $120.

So, the final amount Karen would pay is $120."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, for these 3 magazines, she gets:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

Next, she has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, for this magazine, she gets:
\[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

Then, she has another magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, for this magazine, she gets:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add all these issues together to find out the total number of issues she gets every year:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

So, the total number of magazines (issues) she gets every year is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"Samantha has 27 paintings. She has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, to find out how many paintings Shelley has, we add 12 to Samantha's paintings:
\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
Shelley has 39 paintings. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's paintings:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]
So, Kim has 31 paintings. The answer is 31."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

In November, the toy cost $40.

In December, the price went up by 80%. So, we need to find 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
80% of $40 is:
\[ 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
So, the new price in December is:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price went down by 50%. So, we need to find 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.
50% of $72 is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
So, the new price in January is:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Charlie is a tennis teacher. He charges $80 for each hour of teaching. But for his veteran students, he gives a discount of 25%, so the rate becomes $60 per hour. Today, he has 4 hours of teaching at the regular rate and 2 hours at the discounted rate.

For the regular lessons:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

For the veteran lessons:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding both amounts:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Charlie will make for the day is:

Answer: 15"
"Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 24 of them because \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 60 is 24. So, he had 36 apples left. Then, he gave his sister 9 apples because 25% of 36 is 9. So, he had 27 apples left. He sold each of these apples for $3, so he got \( 27 \times 3 = 81 \) dollars.

The answer is \( \boxed{81} \)."
"Regina wrote 9 novels last year. This is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. To find out how many novels she wrote this year, we need to figure out what number 9 is 3 quarters of.

If 9 is 3 quarters, we can think of it as 9 is 3 out of 4 parts of the total. So, to find the whole, we need to see how many parts make up the whole. If 3 parts are 9, then 1 part is 9 divided by 3, which is 3. Since the whole is 4 parts, we multiply 3 by 4 to get the total number of novels she wrote this year.

So, 3 times 4 is 12.

Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year.

The answer is: 12."
"Michael is driving at a speed of 50 km per hour. He drives for 3 days. If he drives 24 hours a day, he would cover 50 km/h * 24 h/day = 1200 km per day. Over 3 days, he would cover 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km. The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of this distance he has covered, we use the formula: (distance covered / total distance) * 100. So, (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%. 

The answer is 60%."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice. So, her brother used:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

Now, let's say there were \( G \) grapes at the beginning. After Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes, the remaining grapes are:

\[ G - 6 - 30 = G - 36 \]

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie needs 12 grapes. So, the total grapes used for the pies are:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since the remaining grapes were all used for the pies, we can say:

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]

Now, solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 48 + 36 \]
\[ G = 84 \]

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"There were 82 teachers in total. 13 of them were sick, so we subtract 13 from 82. Then we add the 9 substitute teachers.

So, the number of teachers at school that day was 78."
"Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. He buys 1 box of pasta for $1.00, spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount on gruyere cheese, which is $6.00. So, each week he spends $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00. There are 52 weeks in a year, so in one year, he spends $10.00 \times 52 = $520.00.

The answer is $520.00."
"To figure out how much time is spent cleaning, we need to do some math. 

First, we find out how many minutes it takes to clean all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, we multiply 80 by 15, which gives us 1200 minutes.

Next, we need to know how many hours that is. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 1200 by 60, which equals 20 hours.

Now, we need to know how many hours the custodian works in 5 days. They work 8 hours each day, so in 5 days, they work 5 times 8, which is 40 hours.

To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning, we take the time spent cleaning (20 hours) and divide it by the total hours worked in a day (8 hours). This gives us 20 divided by 8, which is 2.5. To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100, so 2.5 times 100 is 250%.

But we need to remember that this is the percentage of the 8-hour workday, not the 40-hour week. So, we take 20 hours (total cleaning time) and divide it by 40 hours (total work week), which gives us 0.5. To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100, so 0.5 times 100 is 50%.

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms.

**Answer: 50%**"
"Elly has 110 books to organize. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so that's 10 + 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many as a middle shelf, so it can hold 20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books. 

So, one bookcase can hold 20 (from the middle shelves) + 20 (from the bottom shelf) + 15 (from the top shelf) = 55 books. 

Elly has 110 books, and each bookcase can hold 55 books, so she needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases. 

**Final Answer: 2**"
"Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. That means she spent 5 times $2.40, which is $12. She sells the eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, she has 5 dozens, which is 60 eggs. If she sells 60 eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs, she will sell 20 sets of 3 eggs, making $20 in total. So, her profit is the total she made minus what she spent, which is $20 - $12 = $8.

The answer is: $8."
"Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of them are red, so that's 50 red hats. After taking out the red hats, he has 50 hats left. Out of these, 3/5 are blue, which means 3/5 of 50 is 30 blue hats. So, the rest, which are the white hats, would be 50 - 30 = 20. Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"Archie buys beef jerky that comes in a bag with 30 sticks and costs $18.00 per bag. There's a $3.00 discount, so the bag now costs $15.00. To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the total cost by the number of sticks. So, $15.00 divided by 30 sticks equals $0.50 per stick. Since we need the answer in cents, $0.50 is 50 cents. 

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents."
"Audrey needs to pass two math tests to move to 7th grade. She needs to get 70% of the total questions correct. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them right. So, she got:

The second test has 40 questions. The total number of questions is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions correct:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

She already got 42 questions correct from the first test, so she needs:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move to 7th grade.

"Mary is making ice cubes with fruit in them for a party. She makes some strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes that are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is 116. So, we can write the equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now, we need to find the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"To figure out how many phone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that for every 2 customers who come to the dealership, 1 buys a car. So, to sell 15 cars, Jason needs 30 customers (because 15 cars times 2 customers per car equals 30 customers).

2. Next, we know that for every 25 phone calls, Jason gets 1 customer. So, to get 30 customers, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls (because 30 customers times 25 phone calls per customer equals 750 phone calls).

So, Jason needs to make \(\boxed{750}\) phone calls to sell 15 cars."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to count the flashlights. There are 4 people in the family, so they have 4 flashlights. Each room has 2 flashlights, and there are 8 rooms, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights. Adding these together, we get 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's count the candles. Half of the 8 rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's also 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles. Adding these together, we get 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, we add the flashlights and candles together: 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56.

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is 56.

The answer is: 56."
"Mitchell bought two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, the total number of chips is 2 times 55, which is 110 chips. His family has 5 members, and if they all get the same number of chips, we divide 110 by 5. That gives us 22 chips per person.

So, each person gets 22 chips.

"To figure out how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice as long as the first side, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 minutes each.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so that's 5 divided by 2, which is 2.5 minutes each.

Now, let's add it all up:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes

So, the total time is:

5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 32.5 minutes

Therefore, the answer is 32.5 minutes."

And the number of helmets was half the number of footballs, so there must be 40 footballs. When I add them all up, I get 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs, which equals 70 items in total.

So, the total number of items I saw is 70."
"Tim spends 6 hours each day at work answering phones. It takes him 15 minutes to deal with each call. We need to find out how many calls he deals with during his 5-day work week.

First, we convert the hours he works each day into minutes:
6 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes/day

Next, we find out how many calls he can handle in a day:
360 minutes/day ÷ 15 minutes/call = 24 calls/day

Since he works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls he handles each day by the number of workdays in a week:
24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls/week

So, the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:
120"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how long it takes for one painting to dry with the old varnish. It takes 7 minutes for one painting. So for 6 paintings, it would be:
\[ 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, for the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting. So for 6 paintings, it would be:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish, we subtract the time for the old varnish from the time for the new varnish:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 30 minutes longer with the new varnish.

**Final Answer: 30 minutes**"
"Crista has 20 plants. 4 of them need half a cup of water each, so that's 4 times 0.5 cups, which is 2 cups. 8 plants need 1 cup each, so that's 8 times 1 cup, which is 8 cups. The rest, which is 20 minus 4 minus 8, equals 8 plants, need a quarter of a cup each. So, 8 times 0.25 cups is 2 cups. Adding all the cups together, we get 2 plus 8 plus 2, which is 12 cups. So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

The answer is 12 cups."
"Phineas Frog had to travel 200 yards to get back home. Half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water. So, he has to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. So, the time he takes to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

In the water, Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, the time he takes to swim 100 yards is:
\[ \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time for both parts of the journey:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to get back home."
"To figure out how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to do a few simple steps.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. He needs 56 popsicle sticks, and each box has 8 sticks. So, we divide 56 by 8:

\[ 56 \div 8 = 7 \]

This means Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

Next, we need to know how much these 7 boxes will cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

So, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.

The final answer is:

\[

Now, to find out how many days she needs to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads each day:

\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all her photos."
"Alicia has to drop off clothes to the dry cleaners every week. She drops off 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt each week. The cost is $5.00 for each blouse, $6.00 for each skirt, and $8.00 for each pair of pants.

First, let's find out how much it costs for one week:
- For blouses: 5 blouses × $5.00 = $25.00
- For pants: 2 pants × $8.00 = $16.00
- For skirt: 1 skirt × $6.00 = $6.00

Now, let's add these up to get the total for one week:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Since she does this every week for 5 weeks, we need to multiply the weekly cost by 5:
$47.00 × 5 = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute. After training, he can speak 2.5 times faster. So, his new speed is:

\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ words per minute} \]

Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages. So, the total number of words is:

\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words} \]

To find out how long it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 words per minute, we do:

\[ \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."
"On the first day, I saw 50 people at the beach. The next day, there were 20 more people, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people. On the third day, the number of people doubled from the second day, so that's 70 * 2 = 140 people. For the rest of the week, I saw an average of 60 people each day, and there are 4 days left in the week, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people. Adding all these up, I saw 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 480 people at the beach that week.

The total number of people I saw at the beach that week is 480."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, in the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.

Next, in the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.

Then, in the following 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.

After that, in the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Finally, after taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the last 30 seconds pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210\]

So, the total number of popped kernels is 210.

The answer is: \(\boxed{210}\)"
"Tim wants to make lemonade for a party. His recipe says 1 cup of fresh lemon juice is needed for 1 gallon of lemonade. He needs 4 gallons for the party and Allen asked for 1 more gallon, making it 5 gallons in total. For 1 cup of juice, he needs 6 lemons. So for 5 cups of juice, he will need 5 times 6 lemons, which is 30 lemons.

The answer is 30 lemons."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much food the German Shepherds eat in a day. There are 3 German Shepherds, and each one eats 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, for the German Shepherds, it's:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ kilograms per day} \]

Next, we need to know how much food the Bulldogs eat in a day. There are 2 Bulldogs, and each one eats 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, for the Bulldogs, it's:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ kilograms per day} \]

Now, we add the food consumption of the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs to get the total daily food consumption:
\[ 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ kilograms per day} \]

Since we want to know the total food consumption for a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ 21 \times 7 = 147 \text{ kilograms per week} \]

So, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we have 10 animals with 2 legs each. So, the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]

Next, we have 15 animals with 4 legs each. So, the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals to get the total number of legs:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \]

Since we want to know the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ 80 \div 2 = 40 \]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know there are 4 blue blocks in the tower.

Next, it says there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So, if there are 4 blue blocks, then there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.

Now, we know the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. So, if we add the blue and yellow blocks together, we get \(4 + 8 = 12\).

To find out how many red blocks there are, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks. So, \(32 - 12 = 20\).

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour, so he travels 90 miles. Then he drives east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering 144 miles. To find out how far he is from his house, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east. So, 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

The answer is 54 miles."
"Gary bought a boat for $9000. Over the first year, it lost 30% of its value. So, the boat's value after the first year is:
\[ 9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 = 6300 \]

In the second year, it lost another 30% of its value. So, the boat's value after the second year is:
\[ 6300 \times (1 - 0.30) = 6300 \times 0.70 = 4410 \]

In the third year, it lost 20% of its value. So, the boat's value after the third year is:
\[ 4410 \times (1 - 0.20) = 4410 \times 0.80 = 3528 \]

So, the boat is worth $3528 after three years."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. We have a big bag of Starbursts with 232 pieces. 

1. There are 54 red candies.
2. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so that's \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
3. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so that's \(54 \div 2 = 27\).

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[54 + 108 + 27 = 189\]

The total number of candies is 232, so the number of pink candies is:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

So, the number of pink candies is 43."
"Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights and took the bus 7 times during her trip in Germany. Each night at the hotel cost $80, and each bus trip cost 10% of the hotel night's price.

First, let's find out how much Helen paid for the hotel:
- 3 nights at $80 each: \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus trips:
- Each bus trip costs 10% of $80, which is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
- 7 bus trips at $8 each: \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the hotel and the bus trips together:
- Total cost: \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for her hotel and bus travels during the trip.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{296}\)"
"Mazie had 52 marbles. Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4. So, Dallas originally had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles. Since Mazie had 52 marbles to start with, she gave Darla 52 - 25 = 27 marbles. So, the answer is 27."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we need to know how much the tickets cost. An adult ticket is $12 and there are 2 adults, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) dollars.

Next, the child ticket is $8, and there is 1 child, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.

Then, they buy 2 popcorns at $3 each, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add all these amounts together: \(24 + 8 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

So, the total amount they pay is \(\boxed{38}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step. First, we need to know the total weight of the car, the luggage, and the children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage is 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds} + 75 \text{ pounds} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much force is needed to move the car. The problem says the force needed is 1% of the total weight. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the total length around his fence. His fence is a rectangle, so we add up all the sides. The long sides are 20 feet each, and the short sides are 15 feet each. So, we do the math like this:

\[ 20 + 20 + 15 + 15 = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

\[
\boxed{70}

"Mia is 40 years old and Emma is 16 years older than Mia, so Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old. To find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and then divide by 2. So, (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48. The average of their ages is 48."
"Tom, Nancy, and Benny found seashells on the beach. Tom found 214, Nancy found 432, and Benny found 86. They found a total of 732 seashells. But they discovered that 67 were cracked. So, the good seashells they found together are:

732 - 67 = 665

The correct answer is 665."
"Avery needs to buy place settings for 12 people. Each place setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl. The dinner plate costs $6.00, the salad plate costs $4.00, and the bowl costs $5.00. 

First, we add up the cost of one place setting:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00
- Total for one place setting: $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00

Now, we need to find out how much 12 place settings will cost:
- Total cost: $15.00 × 12 = $180.00

So, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time to finish the puzzle. Steve took 10 hours, so half of that is 5 hours. Adding 2 hours to 5 hours gives us 7 hours. So, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

The answer is 7 hours."
"Dexter has five pigs. Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, each pig eats 8 pounds of feed per day. For five pigs, that's 40 pounds per day. In a week, that's 280 pounds. Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. After a week, he has 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left.

The answer is 20 pounds."
"John invited 20 people to a party. Each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs. He already has 4 hot dogs from before. So, he needs 40 minus 4, which is 36 more hot dogs. Each pack of hot dogs has 6 in it. So, he needs 36 divided by 6, which is 6 packs. Each pack costs $2, so 6 packs will cost 6 times 2, which is $12. So, he needs to spend $12 on hot dogs. The answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so she earns 20 * 2 = $40 from cupcakes. She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so she earns 40 * 1 = $40 from cookies. In total, she earns $40 + $40 = $80.

She buys five trays at $4 each, so she spends 5 * 4 = $20 on trays.

The money she has left is $80 - $20 = $60.

So, the answer is $60."
"On the first street, there are 5 children following the truck. On the second street, each of these 5 children is joined by another child, so that's 5 more children, making it 10 children in total. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 more children. So now we have 10 (original) + 20 (new) = 30 children. But then the original 5 children leave, so we subtract 5 from 30, which leaves us with 25 children.

So, the final number of children following the truck is 25."
"Mamou has 1,360 meals to give out. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. To find out how many meals she has left, we need to add up the meals she gave out and then subtract that from the total.

First, let's add the meals given out:
64 + 30 + 48 = 142

Now, we subtract the meals given out from the total:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

1,218"
"James found a quarter, two nickels, and seven dimes. Let's count the money he has:

- A quarter is 25 cents.
- Two nickels are 5 cents each, so that's 10 cents.
- Seven dimes are 10 cents each, so that's 70 cents.

Now, let's add them up:

25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (two nickels) + 70 cents (seven dimes) = 105 cents.

So, James has 105 cents."
"Okay, let's figure this out step by step.

We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters. All 3 sisters are 16 years old. So, the total age of the sisters is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \]

One of the brothers is 12 years old, and he is half the age of the older brother. So, the older brother is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Now, let's add up all the ages:
\[ 48 \text{ (sisters)} + 12 \text{ (younger brother)} + 24 \text{ (older brother)} = 84 \]

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84."
"Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes before bed, which is 30 minutes a day. She does this 5 days a week, so that's 150 minutes a week. Over 4 weeks, that's 600 minutes.

She also practices yoga for 1 hour, 5 days a week. That's 5 hours a week, which is 300 minutes. Over 4 weeks, that's 1200 minutes.

Adding both, she spends 600 minutes on meditation and 1200 minutes on yoga, which totals 1800 minutes.

So, the answer is 1800 minutes."
"Sure, let's figure out the total square footage of the quilt Octavia is making.

First, we need to calculate the square footage from each type of t-shirt:

- Small t-shirts: Each is 3 square feet, and she uses 11 of them. So, \(3 \times 11 = 33\) square feet.
- Medium t-shirts: Each is 4 square feet, and she uses 8 of them. So, \(4 \times 8 = 32\) square feet.
- Large t-shirts: Each is 6 square feet, and she uses 6 of them. So, \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Now, we add up all the square footage:
\[33 + 32 + 36 = 101\]

So, the total square footage of the quilt is \(101\) square feet.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{101}

"A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen is 12, a small sunflower has:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. So, the large sunflower has:
\[ 36 + (0.5 \times 36) = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

To find the total number of seeds, we add the seeds from both sunflowers:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times the number of pens that George has, so Timothy has \(3 \times 18 = 54\) pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah has \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\) pens.

The answer is 27."
"Alright, let's figure this out step by step.

First, we know Albert is 36 inches tall. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so Anne is:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is:
\[ 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches} \]

Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so before the summer, she was:
\[ 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches} \]

So, Jackie was \(\boxed{67}\) inches tall before the summer."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

1. The company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day.
2. There are 14 days in two weeks.
3. So, in two weeks, the company makes \(5000 \times 14 = 70000\) bars.
4. Each bar is sold for $2.
5. Therefore, the total money made is \(70000 \times 2 = 140000\) dollars.

So, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars."
"Jake buys 2 T-shirts. Each T-shirt costs $8, but there's a deal where if you buy one, you get the second one at 50% off. So, the first T-shirt costs $8, and the second one costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. That means the T-shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12 in total.

Jake also buys a pair of shoes that are 40% off. The original price of the shoes is $40. So, he pays 60% of $40, which is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

So, the total amount Jake spends is $12 (for the T-shirts) + $24 (for the shoes) = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Ryan gets $6 each week for doing chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he gets:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Then he bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream costs $1.25, so for 4 people, it costs:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream from his total, he has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he wants to go to the movies and each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide his money by the cost of one ticket:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy \(\boxed{2}\) movie tickets."
"Ellen and Lani went to the mall to buy presents for their mom. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. Lani bought a pair of sunglasses at $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each. 

Let's add up the costs:

Ellen's total:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total for Ellen: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani's total:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Bathrobes: $100 + $100 = $200
Total for Lani: $30 + $200 = $230

"To figure out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how much it costs to make one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = $20

Now, add these up to get the total cost for one jar:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the profit from one jar is:
$50 (selling price) - $44 (cost) = $6

If he sells 10 jars, the total profit is:
$6 (profit per jar) × 10 jars = $60

So, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60."
"Sure, let's figure out the total amount of money in the jar.

First, we'll look at the quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, and there are 32 of them. So, 32 quarters times 25 cents each is 800 cents. Since 100 cents make a dollar, 800 cents is 8 dollars.

Next, the dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, and there are 95 of them. So, 95 dimes times 10 cents each is 950 cents. That's 9.50 dollars.

Then, the nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, and there are 120 of them. So, 120 nickels times 5 cents each is 600 cents. That's 6 dollars.

Lastly, the pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, and there are 750 of them. So, 750 pennies times 1 cent each is 750 cents. That's 7.50 dollars.

Now, we add all these amounts together:
8 dollars (from quarters) + 9.50 dollars (from dimes) + 6 dollars (from nickels) + 7.50 dollars (from pennies) = 31 dollars.

So, the total amount of money in the jar is 31 dollars."
"Janet went to the mall and spent some money. She bought ice cream for $3.50, movie tickets for herself and her sister for $7.50 each, and a bracelet for $8.50. Her parents gave her $40. Let's add up what she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 + $7.50 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add these up:
$3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00

Her parents gave her $40, so we subtract what she spent from what she had:
$40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13 left."
"Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he is open 5 days a week. He gets paid $4 per car. 

First, let's figure out how many cars he services in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Now, let's calculate how much he makes in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ \$60/\text{week} \times 2 = \$120 \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 1 of each type for a snack, so he has 8 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 4 sugar cookies left. Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, leaving him with 6 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 4 sugar cookies. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so now he has 6 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 2 sugar cookies. After baking 4 of each type for dinner, he has 10 oatmeal, 7 chocolate chip, and 6 sugar cookies. Adding them all up, he has 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies in total.

The final answer is 23."
"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell half of them for $5 each and the other half for $7 each.

Half of 12 is 6, so he will sell 6 toy soldiers for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers for $7 each.

For the first 6 toy soldiers:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

For the other 6 toy soldiers:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, Matthew would earn \(\boxed{72}\) dollars."
"Nate's dog digs 6 holes every day. For 14 days, the dog digs:

\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate comes back, he starts filling holes at a rate of 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 holes every night. So, the net number of holes filled each day is:

\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

To fill 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, it will take:

\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, it will take:

\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes 4 weeks to fill all the holes.

\[
\boxed{4}

"Norman High School has 4000 students on average. Butler High School has 3/4 of that number. To find out how many students Butler High School has, we do:

\[ 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students on average. To find out how many more students Norman High School has compared to Butler High School, we subtract:

\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Therefore, Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School."
"The Adams family has made a total of 7995 cookies. They have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they have made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total.

So, we do the math:

7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2325

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 2325."
"Igor was supposed to bring 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes to the lab bench. But he only brought half the test tubes, which is 8. He brought two more Petri dishes than requested, so that's 16 Petri dishes. The total number of items on the lab bench is 29. 

Let's figure out how many beakers he brought. We know:
- Test tubes: 8
- Petri dishes: 16
- Total items: 29

So, the number of beakers he brought is:
29 - 8 - 16 = 5

Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, but Igor only brought 5. So, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
7 - 5 = 2

The answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"James is making 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, he needs 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws. For 4 tables, he needs 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws. He starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, he will have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left. 

So, the answer is 8 screws."
"In the first basket, there are 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first one, so it has 20 eggs. If you add them together, you get 30 eggs in total.

So, the answer is 30."
"Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750. Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's add up all the money they raised:
Alexandra: $430
Kim: $750
Sarah: $300
Maryam: $700

Total = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180

So, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"Aaron and Vanessa were running in a relay race. Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa did, so if Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran 2 miles. Aaron finished his part in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, it means Vanessa takes twice as long to run the same distance. So, if Aaron took 16 minutes for 2 miles, Vanessa would take 32 minutes for the same 2 miles. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we need to double the time it took her to run 2 miles. Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes * 2 = 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The answer is 64 minutes."
"The caretaker needs to buy some new line for the docks. For every foot of dock, he needs 3 feet of line. There are 200 feet of dock, so he needs 200 times 3 feet of line, which is 600 feet. He already has 6 feet of new line, so he needs to buy 600 minus 6 feet of line. That means he needs to buy 594 feet of line.

The answer is 594 feet."
"Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. Each reservation costs $15 because they order 2 meals at $5 each and a bottle of wine at $5. So, for one night, the cost is 6 reservations times $15 per reservation, which is $90. Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the total cost for the week is $90 times 2, which is $180.

So, the answer is $180."
"The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost of each watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

\[ \text{Cost per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

The vendor made a profit of 25%, so we need to find 25% of the cost price and add it to the cost price to get the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 0.25 = 0.40 \]

So, the selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

Answer: $2.00"
"John had his son James when he was 19. James is now 18 years older than when he was born, so he is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now. Dora, James's sister, will be 12 in 3 years, so she is 12 - 3 = 9 years old now. James is twice as old as Dora, so he is 2 times 9 = 18 years old. The youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now. In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

The answer is 8."
"Sure, let's figure this out together.

Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes. We need to find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane in one hour.

First, let's see how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- If Ana takes 3 minutes per orange, then in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Now, let's see how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
- If Jane takes 4 minutes per orange, then in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane:
- Ana peels 20 oranges, and Jane peels 15 oranges.
- So, the difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Mark's car needs a new radiator. The radiator costs $400, but he gets it at a junk shop for 80% off. That means he only pays 20% of $400.

\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs him $80.

Next, he hires a mechanic to install it. The mechanic charges $50 an hour and it takes 3 hours.

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

So, the labor costs $150.

Now, we add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total amount Mark paid.

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230.

The answer is: $230."
"Okay, let's think about this problem step by step.

We know Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and these animals are either chickens or cows. Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 70.

Let's say the number of chickens is \( c \) and the number of cows is \( k \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 20, so \( c + k = 20 \).
2. The total number of legs is 70, so \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To find \( k \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can find \( c \) by substituting \( k \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The answer is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"Sure, let's figure this out together. Henry and his 3 friends make 4 people in total. They ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, first we need to find out how many slices there are in total. 

7 pizzas times 8 slices per pizza equals 56 slices. Now, we need to share these 56 slices equally among the 4 people. 

56 slices divided by 4 people equals 14 slices per person. 

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. 

The answer is 14."
