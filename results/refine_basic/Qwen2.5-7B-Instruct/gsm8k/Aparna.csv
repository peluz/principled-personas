"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the distance he runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens.
2. Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, where every second glass is 60% of the regular price, we can break it down as follows:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses there are: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:** $64"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Number of Sheep in Seattle:**

   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of:
\[ 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

On his return trip, he spends:
- 2 hours in standstill traffic (0 miles covered),
- 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering:
\[ 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]
- The remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering:
\[ 80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Total distance covered on the return trip is:
\[ 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance remaining from home is:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

"Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours. For the additional 5 hours of overtime, she earns 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $12 per hour.

- Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
- Overtime earnings: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings for the week: $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, the correct answer is $460."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"Toula went to the bakery and bought various types of pastries. She bought 3 dozen donuts which cost $68 per dozen, 2 dozen mini cupcakes which cost $80 per dozen, and 6 dozen mini cheesecakes for $55 per dozen. To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

2. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance. This means:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

After 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, the remaining number of students is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, the number of students left to enroll in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"

"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can represent Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

We are also given that the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

"Sure, let's break down the guesses:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these guesses. The guesses are 80, 60, and 100.

To find the average, we add these numbers together and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80

"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care hours by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. John takes care of 10 dogs, so the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."

"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, he eats \(2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}\).

2. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:**
   - Each set contains 4 yogurts.
   - The number of sets is \(\frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets}\).

3. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts:**
   - Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
   - The total cost is \(15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars}\).

"John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left.

First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling the lego sets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the 8 video games:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

John has $5 left after buying the video games, so the total money he had initially minus the cost of the video games and the leftover money should equal the money he spent on the video games:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold a certain number of lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, with 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days.

Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed as follows:

\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking over a six-hour period. Therefore, the time spent running and walking is:

\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance covered while running and walking:

\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances gives the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her usual distance of 400 feet. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:

"To determine Charlie's net profit, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**

   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics. Let's break down the number of articles she wrote each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchase.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes used at work.
3. Use the information about the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes left after work is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not have to drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) gives us the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row:**
   - It takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate of water intake:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - Multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
     \[
     \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters."

   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
4. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let the number of ducks be \( D \). Therefore:
   \[
   B = 50D
   \]
5. Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
   \[
   300 = 50D
   \]
6. Solving for \( D \):

- Cost of 2x4x10 boards: \(10 \times 10 = 100\) dollars.
- Cost of 4x4x10 boards: \(5 \times 16 = 80\) dollars.
- Total cost: \(100 + 80 = 180\) dollars.

The prices have increased by 50%, so the new prices are:
- New price of 2x4x10 boards: \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) dollars each.
- New price of 4x4x10 boards: \(16 \times 1.5 = 24\) dollars each.

The total selling price is:
- Selling price of 2x4x10 boards: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars.
- Selling price of 4x4x10 boards: \(5 \times 24 = 120\) dollars.
- Total selling price: \(150 + 120 = 270\) dollars.

"John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. There is a 10% tax on all non-food items.

First, let's identify the food and non-food items:
- Food items: Milk ($2), Eggs ($3)
- Non-food items: Light bulbs ($3), Cups ($3), Roach traps ($4)

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on the non-food items is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of clients:**
   - Kim already has 3 clients.
   - He is talking to 5 potential clients.
   - Total number of clients = 3 + 5 = 8.

2. **Determine the cost per client:**
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - Cost of bleach per bottle = $2.
   - Cost of cloths per pack = $5.
   - Total cost per client = (2 bottles * $2) + (1 pack * $5) = $4 + $5 = $9.

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   - Total number of clients = 8.
   - Total cost per client = $9.
   - Total expenses = 8 * $9 = $72.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Total income per week = $92.
   - Total expenses = $72.
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, with 100 pineapples per hectare. He can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can break it down as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare per harvest:
   \[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \]

2. Calculate the total number of pineapples per harvest for 10 hectares:
   \[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

3. Determine the number of harvests in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year and John harvests every 3 months:
   \[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

4. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
   \[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"Debra is monitoring a beehive and observing the bees coming and going. Here's the breakdown of the observations:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of those 30 bees return, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees.
3. In the following 6 hours, twice as many bees as initially left leave the hive, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees.
4. In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours and 60 bees left in the next 6 hours, a total of \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees return.

Therefore, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 90.

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

"Shawnda decided to offer a bike inflation service in her neighborhood. She charges 25 cents per tire. On the first day, 5 people came with bicycles (each with 2 tires), 3 people came with tricycles (each with 3 tires), and 1 person came with a unicycle (1 tire).

First, calculate the total number of tires inflated:
- Bicycle tires: \(5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}\)
- Tricycle tires: \(3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}\)
- Unicycle tire: \(1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}\)

Total tires inflated: \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20 \text{ tires}\)

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost is:
\[20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

Convert the total cost to dollars:
\[500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the total number of french fries in the pack be \( x \).
2. Dave ate 14 fries, so \( x - 14 \) fries remained.
3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries, so \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries remained.
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries were eaten by the pigeons, leaving \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries.
5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third of the remaining fries. So, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \) fries remained.
6. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest.

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( \$20 \)
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

2. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

3. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the compound interest formula:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

6. **Multiply the original price by the result:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."

To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her total minimum monthly payment for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the amount Jessica pays in a year is $18000."

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and donations step by step:

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amount given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Amount given to daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount given to wife} = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final remaining amount**:
   \[
   \text{Final remaining} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Zaid will still have after all these expenses and donations is:

"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we start by finding the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]
Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]
Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly need into a daily need by dividing the total weekly amount by the number of days in a week:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To find the cost of each cup, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - Shoes (2 pairs): $20 each, so $20 × 2 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Calculate the money Sara earns from babysitting:**
   - She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so $5 × 4 = $20

3. **Determine the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn:**
   - Sara already has $10 saved
   - Total from babysitting: $20
   - Total amount before mowing: $10 + $20 = $30

4. **Calculate how much more money Sara needs:**
   - Total cost of items: $70
   - Total amount Sara has: $30
   - Additional money needed: $70 - $30 = $40

5. **Determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:**
   - She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn
   - Number of times she needs to mow: $40 ÷ $4 = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

**Answer: 10**"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

2. According to the problem, each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

3. The problem also states that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

4. Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   \]

5. Simplify and solve for \( r \):
   \[
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r = 32
   \]
   \[
   r = 4
   \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers. The total number of customers by the third day was 500. Therefore, the number of customers she counted on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10%. The total amount to be returned is calculated as follows:

\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be \(\boxed{220}\)."

"Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age of Zack. We need to calculate the average age of the three in three years if Harriet is 21 years old now.

1. First, determine Harriet's current age: 21 years.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

Next, calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Now, find the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

The average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, calculate Yuri's points:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, calculate Brianna's points:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Therefore, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the water tank has 120 liters of water.
2. Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. So, the amount of water left in the tank is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount of what was left in the tank. The amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]
4. The total amount of water in the tank now is the sum of the water left after Celine used some and the rainwater she collected:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is:

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate her mom's rate. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting these 63 is:

3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \(32 - 4 = 28\).
3. According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \(F\) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \(2F\).
5. We can set up the equation: \(28 = 2 \times 2F\).
6. Simplifying the equation: \(28 = 4F\).
7. Solving for \(F\): \(F = \frac{28}{4} = 7\).

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours each day.
   - Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

2. **Weekly Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   - Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

3. **Total Cost for 5 Weeks:**
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - Total cost before discount = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

4. **Applying the 10% Discount:**
   - The makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
   - Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Therefore, Jean paid \(\boxed{27000}\)."

"The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. First, we calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace gives:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has in cents. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.

1. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
   \[
   5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. Adding the value of the quarters and dimes together gives:
   \[
   125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents}
   \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has. The can of pop costs 55 cents.

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36
   \]
   So, there are 36 stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

2. Subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   \[
   76 - 36 = 40
   \]
   So, there are 40 stars in the 5-star rows.

3. Determine the number of 5-star rows by dividing the number of 5-star stars by 5:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 5 \times 0.2 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{kg per meal} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total consumption per week is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell the bread. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. 

Let's calculate the total number of crates sold:
- Weekend sales: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.

The final answer is \(\boxed{55}\)."

"John hires a driving service to get him to work each day. His work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year. He gets charged $2 per mile driven and also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.

First, calculate the daily miles driven:
\[ 30 \text{ miles (to work)} + 30 \text{ miles (back home)} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, calculate the weekly miles driven:
\[ 60 \text{ miles per day} \times 5 \text{ days per week} = 300 \text{ miles per week} \]

Then, calculate the annual miles driven:
\[ 300 \text{ miles per week} \times 50 \text{ weeks per year} = 15000 \text{ miles per year} \]

Now, calculate the cost for the miles driven annually:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the annual bonus:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars per month} \times 12 \text{ months per year} = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

"Theo has $6000 for his upcoming business trip to South Africa. He spends $100 on each of the 6 business suits, which totals to $600. He also spends $50 on each of the 3 suitcases, which totals to $150. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, the flight ticket costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $1200. 

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000, so the amount he can spend on the trip is $6000 - $2000 = $4000. The total cost of the suits, suitcases, and flight ticket is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2050. Therefore, the amount left for buying gifts is $4000 - $2050 = $1950.

The final amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is \(\boxed{1950}\)."

"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can determine the number of girls and nongendered children as follows:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils. This includes 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are distributed equally among 3 boxes, each box contains:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together, we add their pencils:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to determine how many boxes are required to store all 72 pencils. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

"Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax.

First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A).

"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

We have a class of 200 students split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have an equal number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

Now, we need to calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 30 pounds
- Container = 20 pounds

"John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

He also watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. She earns $10 per hour at her first job and works 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars. At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars. Adding her initial savings and the earnings from both jobs, her total savings are \(80 + 200 + 75 = 355\) dollars. The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is \(400 - 355 = 45\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount Annabelle still needs to save is \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."

   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

"The train travels between three cities. The distances are as follows:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

The total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine the total amount of stuffing needed, we first need to calculate the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Given that a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds), we can find the average as follows:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, a collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the amounts of stuffing needed for the chihuahua and collie beds:

\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing needed is \(\boxed{23}\) pounds."

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for bows on these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, the number of inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we need to find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

First, we determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Tim decides to cancel his cable subscription and switch to streaming services. Netflix costs $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus, normally $10 each, are bundled at a 20% discount. First, calculate the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the discount:

\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per month} \]

With a 20% discount, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus becomes:

\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Adding the cost of Netflix:

\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Tim's original cable package cost $60 per month. Therefore, the amount of money he saves by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to the streaming services is:

\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars per month} \]

So, the final answer is:

"Sally went to the seashore and her parents gave her $10 to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- For the first pound, she pays $3.
- For the second pound, she gets 1/2 off, so she pays $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- Total cost for taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- Seashells cost $1.50.
- Magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.
- Total cost for seashells and magnets = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all items:
- Total cost = $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\(\boxed{350}\)"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
- The total number of heads is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve these equations. First, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, we substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

1. **Identify the cost of the tattered jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is \( 28 - 6 = 22 \).

3. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

4. **Determine the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \).
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \).

5. **Find the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22.
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is $2.

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He sells 2/3 of \( x \), which is 100 cards.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed. Josey required \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the amount of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6 \text{ pints}} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent a total of $5 and had 1% of his money left, which means he had $0.05 left.
2. Therefore, the amount he actually spent is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.**

The dimensions of one raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.**

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.**

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.**

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"

\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes**:

\[3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490 \text{ pounds}\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number (since a fraction of a trip would still require a full trip):
\[
\frac{4490}{2250} \approx 2.0044
\]
Rounding up, we get 3 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{3}\) trips to transport all the feed."

"Paul drives his car twice a day for 14 days. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2. To find out the total amount of money he spent, we need to calculate the cost for both the morning and afternoon rides over the 14 days.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"Brianne and Ashley are making Greek orange pie. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges. Together, they have \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges. Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(\frac{120}{3} = 40\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. She bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We need to find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

First, let's find the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take 10 days for one person to paint a whole house.

The rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Converting days into hours:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which means Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas. 

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add Ophelia's and Jenna's sofas and chairs together:
- Total sofas: \(20 + 64 = 84\)
- Total chairs: \(22 + 66 = 88\)

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Tom bought a CD for $4.
2. The total amount he paid was $48.
3. To find the cost of the headphone set, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:
   \[
   \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44
   \]
4. If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs.
5. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11
   \]

Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's determine the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we can calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\).

Therefore, Jame's cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer cost $1,100.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is 72 vlogs, so we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to meet her goal."
"To determine how much you end up paying, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The original bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - Tip amount = 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10.
   - Total bill including tip = $50 + $10 = $60.

2. **Determine how the bill is split:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays = $60 / 2 = $30.

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:

"Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target.

1. April has 30 days, so the first half and the second half each have 15 days.
2. Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.
3. Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half.
4. Total savings in the first half: \( 15x \).
5. Total savings in the second half: \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).
6. Total monthly savings: \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).
7. Set up the equation: \( 45x = 1125 \).
8. Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \).

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \).

Let's express the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( T \). The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"To find the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Next, we add the number of legs from all the pets together:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is:

"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 + 0.5 \times 8 = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. Therefore, the weight he now uses is:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight that Jamaal now uses is \(\boxed{10}\) pounds."

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to find the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so the speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we use this speed to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

"Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, which means he can make 60 pounds per hour. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Therefore, Marissa makes:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

If they worked for 12 hours in a day, the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz made is:

\[
60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

And the total amount of chocolate pounds Marissa made is:

\[
90 \times 12 = 1080 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together:

\[
720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday. On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars. 

To find out how much money he has left, we first calculate his total spending over the three days:
\[8 + 16 + 64 = 88\]

Since he originally had $100, the amount of money he has left is:
\[100 - 88 = 12\]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the earnings step by step.

First, calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \boxed{42}."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Washings per Bottle**: The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.
2. **Washings per Pump**: Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
   \[
   \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
   \]
3. **Cost per Washing**: The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
   \[
   \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
   \]
4. **Cost per Pump**: Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
   \]
5. **Convert to Cents**: Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out have a price of $35. 

First, calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts do not have a discount, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will have:
\[ 0 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. 

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, we can find the time it takes for Tom to catch up by dividing the distance by the relative speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

5 hours"

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by calculating the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

Given:
- Total cost for Karate classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, reversing the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"Ariane has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. To find the total amount she made in two months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the earnings from green hats in the first month:
   - Since the sales from red hats were $400 and this is half of the green hat sales, the green hat sales in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. Calculate the total earnings in the first month:
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. Calculate the earnings in the second month:
   - The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. Calculate the total earnings over the two months:
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The total amount Ariane made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\)."

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
- Total number of heads is 20.
- Total number of legs is 70.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ \begin{cases} 
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35 
\end{cases} \]

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Roger buys a week's worth of coffee at a more expensive brand that costs 20% more than the normal brand, which originally costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand thus costs:

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

"John brings his dog to the vet. The dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, and a heartworm check, which is 60% of the total bill. We need to find out how much John leaves with after paying the total bill.

First, calculate the cost of the vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we determine the amount raised per hour. Since they raised $2100 in 3 hours, the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours needed to raise the remaining $4200:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total city usage percentage to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the remaining percentage is for non-industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Non-industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

So, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so in 14 days, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces.

Next, we calculate how much candy each person has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, we find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces, so Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

"James decides to pick some blueberries. It costs $20 to go picking and then an additional $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. How much did he save compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound?

First, calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- Initial cost to go picking: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)
\[
\text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
\]

Next, calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:
- Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
- Pounds of blueberries: 30

Total cost at the store = Cost per pound × Pounds picked
\[
\text{Total cost at the store} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
\]

Finally, calculate the savings:
- Total cost of picking: $65
- Total cost at the store: $75

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of students in each of the six groups when fifty-four students are divided equally:

\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]

So, each of the six groups has 9 students. 

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide 54 by 12:

\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students.

To find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from the original 6 groups, we subtract the number of existing groups from the required number of groups:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of movies**: 600
2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Movies in series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]
3. **Cost for series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]
4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]
5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]
6. **Cost for older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800
   \]
7. **Normal movies**: The rest of the remaining movies are normal movies.
   \[
   \text{Normal movies} = 400 - 160 = 240
   \]
8. **Cost for normal movies**: Each normal movie costs $10.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for normal movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400
   \]

"Ava and Emma are playing a video game level to see who is better. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries, but finishes 4 seconds slower. The scoring system is as follows:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on
- 5 points for each berry collected
- 30 points for each second left on the timer when the level is finished

Let's denote:
- \( E_e \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( E_b \) as the number of berries Emma collects
- \( E_t \) as the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level

For Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The scores are calculated as:
- Emma's score: \( 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \)
- Ava's score: \( 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \)

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total cost of four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, given that they cost the same amount.

First, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost:
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

This means the remaining cost for the other two pizzas is $34. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2:
\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas costs $17.

The final answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish he bought is 17, so \(O + W = 17\).
2. After buying the fish, the number of orange fish is \(3 + O\) and the number of white fish is \(4 + W\). According to the problem, \(3 + O = 2(4 + W)\).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(O + W = 17\)
2. \(O - 2W = 5\)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the first equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):
\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the second equation:
\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]
\[17 - 3W = 5\]
\[-3W = 5 - 17\]
\[-3W = -12\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):
\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Milo is making a mosaic with glass chips. It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?

First, calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has:
\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall, we can find the length by dividing the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to account for the tea consumed and the tea remaining.

First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total tea consumed:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \text{ gallons} \]"
"Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150, which means he needed to order more. He then ordered 100 more candies. 

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
   \[
   200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is 310.

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

2. Write the equation for the total amount of the salt scrub:
   \[
   z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2z + 4s = 10
   \]
   Divide the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   z + 2s = 5
   \]

3. Solve for \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
   \[
   z = 5 - 2s
   \]

4. Since \( z \) and \( s \) must be positive and the total must be 10 ounces, we can find the value of \( s \) that satisfies the equation. For example, if \( s = 1 \):
   \[
   z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]
   This satisfies the equation.

5. The amount of oil is \( 2s \):
   \[
   2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. To find out how much money he spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Sasha and Julie are playing on opposing basketball teams. In the first game, Sasha had the home court advantage and scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which means Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points. In the second game, which was at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games together:
\[14 + 4 = 18\]

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway.

First, let's find the total distance \(D\) that the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk a day from one cow. With 3 cows, he can extract:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional amount of milk he needs to produce is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows he needs is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\$5600\)."

"To determine how many students are good at math, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both math and English. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English to find the total number of students who are good at math:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

"Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. To find out how much she will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"
"The clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. 

- Half of the white shirts have collars, so the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
- Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

The difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J \) is an integer. Let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both the small and large masks:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. So, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   Adding up the hours worked on each day, we get:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days is:

"Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. The total cost of the cake is $11. The balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, so 1 dozen (12 balloons) would cost:
\[
\frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]
The ice cream cost $7 per tub, and they bought 2 tubs, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
\[
2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]
Adding up all the expenses, the total amount spent is:
\[
11 + 6 + 14 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]
Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover this total, and they had the same amount, each of them must have received:
\[
\frac{31}{2} = 15.5 \text{ dollars}
\]
Therefore, the amount each of them received from their mother is \(\boxed{15.5}\) dollars."

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - There are 30 students.
   - Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is \(30 \times 10 = 300\).

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \(300 \times 0.8 = 240\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(300 \times 0.5 = 150\) dollars.

4. **Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:**
   - The profit is \(240 - 150 = 90\) dollars.

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down the tree and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[

"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately and then sum them up.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - Each normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - Mini cinnamon rolls have \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - Each normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - Mini blueberry muffins have \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - Adding the total calories from both types of pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \( \boxed{85000} \)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, let's sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[

"The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, so the distance covered by the bus is:
\[ 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance covered by the car is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car is:
\[ 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

**Final Answer:** $64,800"
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for every hour after that. 

First, calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would be 1600 pesos. 

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:

"James buys 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = \$150 \]

He gets them for 40% off, so the discount amount is:
\[ 0.40 \times 150 = \$60 \]

The total cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 - 60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each, so the total amount he gets from selling them is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = \$200 \]

Since he was initially out $90 and then got $200 from selling the CDs, the net amount he was out is:
\[ 90 - 200 = -110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and he ended up with a positive amount, the correct answer is that he was not out any money but rather made a profit. However, the question specifically asks for the money he was out, so the answer is:
\[ \boxed{\$0} \]"

"To calculate Cayley's total commission, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Calculate the commission from the New York Times.**

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.**

- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- Each copy of the Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- He sells 10 copies.

The commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal is:
\[ 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 10 copies is:
\[ 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.**

The total commission is:
\[ 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know that Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored a total of 45 points. We also know the following relationships:
1. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
2. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we can write the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now that we have \( B = 25 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. If the book is 1.5 inches thick, we need to determine the total number of pages in the book.

First, calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we divide the total number of pages by 2:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages} \]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, we first calculate the total time in minutes.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. Additionally, she was awake from 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 3 hours and 17 minutes or 227 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we need to subtract the time she was awake and sleepwalking from her usual sleep duration:
\[ 480 - (227 + 23) = 480 - 250 = 230 \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen cups, which is 24 measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons}
\]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons}
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of his measuring cups and remaining measuring spoons:

\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with initially 1/5 of the beds occupied. This means 200 beds are occupied initially, leaving 800 unoccupied. Over 2 weeks (14 days), 50 patients are admitted each day, resulting in a total of 700 new admissions. Adding these to the initial 200 occupied beds, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 900. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds is \(1000 - 900 = 100\).

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is **100**."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. The remaining emails are \(16 - 7 = 9\).
4. Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to family, which is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\).
5. The remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are \(9 - 6 = 3\).
6. One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1\).

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can determine his age as:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Given that Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert and Kelly stated that this number was 20% higher than the actual number, we need to find the correct number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First Day:** The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day:** They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day:** They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

We know that by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so together they received:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so Collins received:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. 

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Each episode is 20 minutes long.

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three segments:

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net southward distance:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

Net distance:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen, which is 6 brownies. When she got home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ 48 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The price of each phone is $600. The first two phones are at full price, so the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes. Subtracting these from the initial 12 boxes, she has 8 boxes left. She kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes, which is 2 boxes. Therefore, she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

The final answer is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be 5 years from now. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, meaning his dad will be 48 years old. Also, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old at that time.

To find their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of petunias needed:**
   - Each basket requires 3 petunias.
   - Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed:**
   - Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

3. **Determine the cost of the petunias:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

4. **Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

5. **Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
   - Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes separately.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be completed sequentially, the total time required is the sum of the time for peeling and the time for sautering:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is \boxed{45} minutes."
"The air conditioner cools the room at 2 degrees per hour on low and 3 degrees per hour on high. It ran on low for 3 hours, then on high for 4 hours, and was turned off for 2 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights are to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"Given the information:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the given information:
1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Doctor Jones has 9 hours scheduled at the clinic on Monday. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds and has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. With 9 inpatients, the total time spent on rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 180 minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on rounds and appointments:

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So,
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

Thus, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Now, calculate \( 1400 \times 5.9 \):
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Now, calculate \( 8260 \times 0.10 \):
\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
- Difference = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Brook Hills High School currently enrolls 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16 years old. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 375 male students over 16 years old. Therefore, the number of female students over 16 years old is \(1500 - 375 = 1125\).

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students under 16 years old. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 750 male students under 16 years old. Therefore, the number of female students under 16 years old is \(1500 - 750 = 750\).

Adding the number of female students over 16 years old and under 16 years old gives the total number of female students: \(1125 + 750 = 1875\).

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \(\boxed{1875}\)."
"Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, which means Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. After 8 hours, the power bank has 28% charge remaining.
2. For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
   \[
   x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5
   \]
3. For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
   \[
   x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3
   \]
4. We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
   \]
5. Calculate the values of \((0.91)^5\) and \((0.93)^3\):
   \[
   (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032
   \]
   \[
   (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357
   \]
6. Substitute these values into the equation:
   \[
   x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28
   \]
   \[
   x \times 0.501872 = 0.28
   \]
7. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578

"Jamaar has $10 to spend on fresh fruits. The prices are as follows:
- Peaches and pears: $0.50 each
- Apples: $0.75 each
- Kiwis: $1.00 each
- Plums: $0.25 each

Jamaar has already purchased:
- 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\) dollars
- 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\) dollars
- 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\) dollars
- 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

The total cost of the fruits he has already bought is:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar has:
\[10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars left to spend on plums.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the prices and relationships:**
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

2. **Define the quantities sold:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from selling the large stuffed animals is \(12x\) dollars.
   - The total earnings from selling the small stuffed animals is \(4 \times 2x = 8x\) dollars.
   - The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is \(12x + 8x = 20x\) dollars.

4. **Use the given total earnings to find \(x\):**
   - We know the total earnings are $120, so we set up the equation \(20x = 120\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\).

5. **Determine the number of small stuffed animals sold:**
   - Since \(x = 6\), the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Convert the daily work time into hours:**
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

**Final Answer:**
47.25"
"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, which means there are 25 English books. Additionally, 10% of the books are written in German, which amounts to 5 German books. The rest of the books are written in Spanish. 

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20."

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the answer is 15 gallons."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

**Final Answer: $55**"
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"James's insurance cost after the accident is 60% more than the normal cost of $120 per month. First, we calculate the increased amount:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the new monthly cost is:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = 6 \(\times\) 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{24}\)."

2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, let's sum up the total number of stickers:

- Stickers from two years ago: 100
- Stickers collected last year: 50
- Stickers collected this year: 100

Total stickers = 100 + 50 + 100 = 250

So, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption first. Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed by one cat in one day is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all the cats in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last \(\boxed{2}\) days."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Jake ate 3 fewer slices than Becky, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's sum up the slices eaten by all three:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}

"Maggie and Riza each have $60 left after spending some of their money. Let's calculate how much money they originally had and how much they spent.

For Maggie:
- She spent a quarter of her money, so she has three-quarters left.
- If three-quarters of her money is $60, then her original amount of money \( M \) can be calculated as:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80. She spent:
\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \]
dollars.

For Riza:
- She spent one-third of her money, so she has two-thirds left.
- If two-thirds of her money is $60, then her original amount of money \( R \) can be calculated as:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90. She spent:
\[ 90 - 60 = 30 \]
dollars.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:

   - In a week, the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

3. **Second Monkey's Consumption:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - In a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

4. **Third Monkey's Consumption:**
   - Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).
   - In a week, the third monkey eats \(7x\) bananas.

5. **Total Bananas Equation:**
   - The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey.
   - Therefore, \(70 + 98 + 7x = 315\).

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Combine the known values: \(168 + 7x = 315\).
   - Subtract 168 from both sides: \(7x = 147\).
   - Divide both sides by 7: \(x = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"Aparna: 

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. She has already saved:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

To reach her goal of 200 toothpicks, she needs:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The original price of the watch is $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
4. To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid, and then find what percentage this difference is of the original price.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Rate of Jellyfish Creation per Spring:**
   - Each spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.

2. **Total Time in Seconds:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Jellyfish Created by One Spring in 4 Hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Jellyfish Created by 5 Springs in 4 Hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from 10 bunches:
   - Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

2. Calculate the total cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually:
   - The cost of one banana is $0.80.
   - Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

3. Calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
   - The cost of one bunch is $3.00.
   - Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

4. Calculate the savings:
   - Savings = Total cost for individual bananas - Total cost for bunches
   - Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

Therefore, the total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is \(\boxed{131250}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the rate of hay production and pickup:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales of hay per hour.
   - The truck picks up 3 bales of hay per hour.

2. **Calculate the net change in the number of hay bales per hour:**
   - Each hour, the farmer produces 5 bales, but the truck removes 3 bales.
   - Therefore, the net increase in the number of hay bales in the field per hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

3. **Calculate the total net change over 6 hours:**
   - Since the net increase is 2 bales per hour, over 6 hours, the total number of bales added to the field is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

4. **Determine the number of bales left in the field after 6 hours:**
   - Assuming the field starts with 0 bales, after 6 hours, the number of bales left in the field is 12.

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is **12**."
"John has 8 classes in a week, each lasting 40 minutes. He goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total class time during the weekdays is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of Saturday and Sunday for extra learning. Therefore, the extra learning time on each of these days is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls.

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet each. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet each. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought a total of 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants 1/3 of that, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples is 12 kg. After Pierre and Paul take their shares, the amount left for Jacques (or James) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed to complete the order:**
   - The manufacturer needs another 20 toys to complete the order of 400 toys, so the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Kris's Stickers:**
   - Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob.
   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Luis's Stickers:**
   - Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris.
   - Since Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half.
   - Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Seth's Stickers:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Since Luis originally had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so if Arnold painted \(A\) eggs, Madeline also painted \(A\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. If Sarah painted \(S\) eggs, then Camden painted \(S + 12\) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

From the information given:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \(S = 9\) into \(A + S = 22\):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted \(S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.

The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

   - Given: 40 minutes.

2. **Distance on the beach:**
   - Given: 2 miles.

3. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed on the beach in miles per minute.
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so \( 40 = \frac{2}{v} \).
   - Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

4. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Given that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the probability of winning for the first ticket.
2. Determine the probability of winning for the second ticket.
3. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

Given:
- The probability of winning for the first ticket, \( P_1 \), is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so the probability of winning for the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production year by year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces be \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, \(x = 20 \times 50 = 1000\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, summing up the fruits produced each year:

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we get:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining money for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

So, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - Additional pods = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods.
   - Total pods in the special size box = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - Cost per pod = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

3. **Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1:**
   - Since each pod runs one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is the same as the number of pods you can buy for $1.

"James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. To find the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we follow these steps:

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which is \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.
3. The total number of teeth fixed is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
4. The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated as \(\left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 50\%\).

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine the refund amount, we first calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we find out how much of the milk had passed the expiry date:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is based on the cost of the sour milk:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.
   - Converting 300 minutes into hours, we get \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"When Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it came out 20 years ago. John is currently 28 years old. If we go back 20 years, John would have been 8 years old. At that time, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim must have been 4 years old when Digimon came out. Since 20 years have passed since then, Jim is now 4 + 20 = 24 years old.

Final answer: Jim is 24 years old."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The difference is \(109 - 78 = 31\), which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"Aparna here!

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Given that April has exactly 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of days Jen works in April as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten:
\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:

Given that the average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles, the total miles for all 4 dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the selling price of the magazines.
2. Calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price.

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72. So, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
Thus, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[

"To determine the initial number of grapes, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes were used to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
4. The remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother used their grapes were all used for the pies, so the remaining grapes are 48. This means the initial number of grapes minus the grapes used by Madeline and her brother equals the grapes used for the pies:
   \[
   G - 6 - 30 = 48
   \]
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   G - 36 = 48

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Feed Consumption for One Pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for Five Pigs:**
   Dexter has five pigs, so the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption for Five Pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Remaining Feed After a Week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the remaining feed after a week is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:

"John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. Therefore, the number of packs he needs to buy is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each and 40 cookies at $1 each. The total money earned from cupcakes is \(20 \times 2 = \$40\), and from cookies is \(40 \times 1 = \$40\). Therefore, the total money earned is \(40 + 40 = \$80\).

She then buys five trays at $4 each, which costs \(5 \times 4 = \$20\).

Subtracting the cost of the trays from the total money earned, we get \(80 - 20 = \$60\).

Therefore, the amount of money Frances has left is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - Number of new children joining = 5 (one for each of the original 5 children).
   - Total number of children now = 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - Number of new children joining = 10 (original 10 children) × 2 = 20.
   - Total number of children now = 10 (original) + 20 (new) = 30.

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children leave the group.
   - Total number of children now = 30 (current total) - 5 (original 5 children who left) = 25.

So, the final number of children following the truck is:
```

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.
2. All 3 sisters are 16 years old.
3. One brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.

From the information given, we can determine the age of the older brother:
- The older brother is twice the age of the 12-year-old brother, so the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings:
- The total age of the 3 sisters: \(3 \times 16 = 48\)
- The age of the 12-year-old brother: \(12\)
- The age of the older brother: \(24\)

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour:
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour:
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The original cost of the radiator is $400.
2. Mark gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.
   \[
   \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80
   \]
3. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.
   \[
   \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150
   \]
4. Adding the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor gives us the total amount Mark paid.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230
   \]

So, the final amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. Set up the equations based on the given information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( c + k = 20 \)
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

3. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

4. We now have the system of equations:
   - \( c + k = 20 \)
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

5. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   - \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \)
   - \( k = 15 \)

6. Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   - \( c + 15 = 20 \)
   - \( c = 5 \)

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the total number of pizza slices:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine the number of people sharing the pizzas:
\[ 1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ (friends)} = 4 \text{ people} \]

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

The final answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
