**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The increase in value is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[
\boxed{70000}
\]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one session, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Thus, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens.
2. Determine the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we calculate the total daily feed requirement for all 20 chickens:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to account for the discount on every second glass. Each first glass costs $5, and each second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, we need to break down the process into several steps.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."

"Eliza's earnings for the week can be calculated by breaking down her hours into regular and overtime hours and applying the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance. This means:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

After the contemporary dance enrollment, the remaining number of students is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

The number of students left to enroll in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

It is also given that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age now is 162, we can set up the following equations to find their current ages.

Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\). The sum of their ages is given by:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Gunter's friends made the following guesses:
1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first guess, which is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \).
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \).

To find the average of these guesses, we sum them up and divide by the number of guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, use the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Given the information, we need to determine the number of jewels Siobhan has. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Therefore, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find the points scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game gives us the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:

"John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left.

First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling the lego sets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the 8 video games:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the video games and the leftover money from the total money he had to find out how much money he has left from selling the lego sets:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed, and then calculate the distances she covers while running and walking in the given time.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed:
     \[
     3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed:
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running (one-third of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking (two-thirds of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."

   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

"To find the total number of gems in the chest, we need to determine the number of each type of gem and then sum them up.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, the number of rubies is:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: There are twice as many emeralds as rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, we sum the number of each type of gem to find the total number of gems in the chest:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 595

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \(180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

2. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed for the first 180 days:
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \(\frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636\).

"Given the problem, we need to determine the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David, based on the laundry done by Sarah.

1. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry.
3. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4D = 400
   \]
4. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]
   Therefore, David does 100 pounds of laundry.
5. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:

"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the second equation to find \( W \):

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary starts with 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

We can set up a proportion to solve this problem:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:
\[
10 \times 42 = 3 \times x
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Solving for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box to find the inner dimensions.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) gives us the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

Frankie's TV watching schedule is as follows:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours (two 1-hour episodes).

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The total time spent watching TV is the sum of the time spent each day:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Combining the known values:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

Therefore, Frankie watched \(\boxed{3}\) episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we can express the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phone capacities:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Brittany's phone capacity and the number of ducks:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sasha originally bought ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each and five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each. The total cost for the 2x4x10 boards is \(10 \times 10 = 100\) dollars, and the total cost for the 4x4x10 boards is \(5 \times 16 = 80\) dollars. Therefore, the total cost of the lumber is \(100 + 80 = 180\) dollars.

Since the price of lumber has increased by 50%, the new price for the 2x4x10 boards is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) dollars each, and the new price for the 4x4x10 boards is \(16 \times 1.5 = 24\) dollars each. The total selling price for the 2x4x10 boards is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) dollars, and the total selling price for the 4x4x10 boards is \(5 \times 24 = 120\) dollars. Therefore, the total selling price is \(150 + 120 = 270\) dollars.

The profit Sasha makes is the total selling price minus the total cost, which is \(270 - 180 = 90\) dollars.

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\) dollars."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as \(7x\) and \(13x\) respectively, where \(x\) is a common multiplier. The total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by \(7x\). Substituting the value of \(x\), we get:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's current salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92.

"Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, which means she slept 6 hours each day on Tuesday and Wednesday. For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the 6 hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday, which means she slept 7 hours each day for those four days.

To find the total hours she slept throughout the week, we can sum up her sleep hours:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday and Wednesday: \(6 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}\)
- Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: \(7 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ hours}\)

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we start by identifying the number of each type of car available for rent. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Let's define the variables for the number of each type of bee:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply by his hourly wage.

First, calculate the total hours spent playing video games in one week:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from working those 14 hours:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

"John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. There is a 10% tax on all non-food items.

First, we identify the food and non-food items:
- Food items: milk ($2), eggs ($3)
- Non-food items: light bulbs ($3), cups ($3), roach traps ($4)

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on the non-food items is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses.

First, let's find the total number of clients:
\[ 3 \text{ existing clients} + 5 \text{ potential clients} = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of supplies for each client:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Now, we find the total expenses for all clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9 \text{ per client} = \$72 \]

"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

We need to work backwards from the end to find the initial number of fries:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let \( y \) be the number of fries before the raccoon. The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

Therefore, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate his weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate his weekly class hours:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

First, let's calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, we determine the number of fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Adding the totals for Anakin and Locsin:

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest. The original price of the bag is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months.

1. Convert the percentage increase to a decimal: \(20\% = 0.20\).
2. Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) periods.
3. Use the compound interest formula to find the price after 18 periods: \(P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n\), where \(P_0 = 20\), \(r = 0.20\), and \(n = 18\).

Calculate \((1.20)^{18}\):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366

"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). This gives us the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, using \( S = 2B \):

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first calculate her total minimum monthly payment:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Thus, the amount Jessica pays in a year is \(\boxed{18000}\)."

"Let's break down Zaid's monthly expenses and donations step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amount given to daughter and wife**:
   \[
   \text{Amount given to daughter} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the number of red roses Fred must deliver, we start by defining the number of white carnations as \( W \). According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 5W = 200 \]

Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Next, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let \( R \) represent the number of red roses. Thus, we have:
\[ R = 4W \]

Substituting the value of \( W \) into the equation:
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's order."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we need to determine Jean's age.

First, let's establish Mark's age two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old. Half of Jan's age at that time was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).

Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old.

Since this was two years ago, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\) years old.

The problem states that Jean is two years older than Mark. Thus, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\) years old.

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

Therefore, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"To determine the daily insect consumption for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly consumption for the entire flock. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly consumption into a daily consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by the number of days in a week:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[

First, we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and there are 25 chocolate bars. Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples gives us the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \text{ grams} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To determine the cost of each cup, we start by calculating the cost of half a dozen plates. Given that each half dozen plate costs $6000, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

Next, we need to find the cost of twenty dozen cups. According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 6000 - 1200 = 4800 \]

Since twenty dozen cups equal 240 cups (20 dozen * 12 cups/dozen), the cost per cup is:
\[ \frac{4800}{240} = 20 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, with Sara wanting 2 pairs. Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars. Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, we account for the money Sara already has and the money she earns from babysitting. Sara has $10 saved and earns $5 for each of the 4 times she babysits, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars. Adding her savings and babysitting earnings, Sara has \(10 + 20 = 30\) dollars.

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract her current total from the total cost of the items: \(70 - 30 = 40\) dollars. Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we divide the remaining amount needed by her earnings per mow: \(40 \div 4 = 10\).

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Given the dimensions of the park are 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour) into the formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which totals 150 customers. The total number of customers by the third day was 500. Therefore, the number of customers counted on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 250\).

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( \boxed{8} \) gallons."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The total amount to be returned is calculated as follows:

\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be \(\boxed{220}\)."
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, the number of dahlias is \(4 + 7 = 11\). Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

"Given the problem, we need to determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, starting from their current ages.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years.

In three years:
- Harriet's age will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.
- Zack's age will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.
- Adrian's age will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

To find the average age in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Points**: The four students scored a total of 251 points.
2. **Naomi's Points**: Naomi scored 68 points.
3. **Yuri's Points**: Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's points are:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
4. **Brianna's Points**: Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's points are:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we can calculate the points scored by Jojo by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."

"Carlos and Benji are renting different water sports equipment at the beach. Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and uses it for 3 hours, while Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour and uses it for 5 hours. To find the total cost of their rentals, we calculate the cost for each separately and then sum them up.

For Carlos:
\[ \text{Cost} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

For Benji:
\[ \text{Cost} = 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding these costs together:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete a 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, we know that Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which means her mom can place:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Adding their rates together gives us their combined rate:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"Initially, the watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. This means:

\[ 120 \times 0.30 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were taken home by Ashlyn, leaving:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. Therefore, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:

\[ 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63 \]

Subtracting these from the remaining 84 watermelons gives:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"Mike was a pen pal with 5 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them. They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?

1. **Number of pen pals left**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.
2. **Letters sent and received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters.
3. **Letters Mike sends**: Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.
4. **Total pages written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.
5. **Time spent writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.
6. **Convert minutes to hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( \boxed{7} \)."
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily cost of the makeup artist:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours each day.
   - Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

2. **Calculate the weekly cost of the makeup artist:**
   - The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   - Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks:**
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - Total cost before discount = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

4. **Apply the 10% discount:**
   - The makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
   - Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Therefore, Jean paid \(\boxed{27000}\)."

So, the total cost is \(200 \times 1.50 = 300\) dollars.

Therefore, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each ate over the two days and then convert those amounts into calories.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Therefore, Sue's sister ate a total of \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.
- Therefore, Sue ate a total of \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, we convert the number of cookies into calories. Since each cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
- The difference is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

\[
\boxed{5600}

   \]

4. **Number of girls in the third class:**
   \[
   30 \text{ girls} - 27 \text{ girls} = 3 \text{ girls}
   \]

5. **Number of boys in the third class:**
   \[
   20 \text{ students} - 3 \text{ girls} = 17 \text{ boys}
   \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is \(\boxed{17}\)."

"The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. First, we calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Next, we find the total weight of the redwood before any termites ate it:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

We then calculate the weight of the remaining redwood:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

"To determine the total amount of flour Carla needs, we first calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies today} + 30 \text{ cookies tomorrow} = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we use the given ratio of flour to cookies to find out how much flour is needed for 66 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we set up the proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need \(\boxed{11}\) cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we start by calculating two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:

\[
6200 \div 100 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \(\boxed{62}\)."

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to break down the process into three steps:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees, the time to heat to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."

"In 10 years, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages will be 30.

**Explanation:**
Currently, the sum of their ages is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, the total increase in their combined age will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years. Adding this to their current total age gives us \(20 + 20 = 30\).

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. With 40 cobras, each having 70 spots, the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. With 60 mambas, each having 35 spots, the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding these together gives the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, to find half of this combined total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"

"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace gives:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:
\[ 17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Alani, Braylen, and Margot each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week for the second week. In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. Doubling these amounts for the second week, Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories, Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories, and Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories written by all three over the two weeks, we sum the stories from each week:
- Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
- Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
- Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

Adding these totals together, we get:
\[60 + 120 + 180 = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is:
\(\boxed{360}\)"

"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

First, we calculate the stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the stars in the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \]

The total number of stars on the flag is 76. Subtracting the 36 stars from the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars from the total gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a 30-minute break. The total working time is 3 hours minus 30 minutes, which is 2.5 hours. Converting 2.5 hours to minutes gives us 150 minutes. Since she earns $5 for every 10 minutes, we calculate the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes as 150 / 10 = 15 intervals. Therefore, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5/interval = $75.

The final amount Susan earns for the online task is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"After the first three rounds, the points for each player are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points:
- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Adding these together, the total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

Therefore, the total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:
83"
"Will buys 15 oranges. His oldest son, who is 8 years old, will wash 8 oranges, and his youngest son, who is half as old as the oldest (4 years old), will wash 4 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges washed is \(8 + 4 = 12\).

Starting with 15 oranges, after washing 12, the number of unwashed oranges is \(15 - 12 = 3\).

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household:
   \[
   \text{Rice per meal} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg/meal}
   \]

2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day:
   \[
   \text{Rice per day} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
   \[
   \text{Rice per week} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}
   \]

4. Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:
   \[

"Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell the bread. Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. 

To find out how many crates he sold in total during the week, we sum the crates sold each day:
- Weekend: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Sam's target was 120 crates, so the number of crates he was off from his target is:
120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books sold in the first year.
2. Determine the total number of books sold over the three years.
3. Find the number of books sold in the second year.
4. Calculate the earnings from the books sold in the second year.

First, we know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year. Since she sold 45 books this year, the number of books sold in the first year is:
\[ 2 \times 45 = 90 \]

Next, we know the total number of books in the collection is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

The number of books sold in the second year can be found by subtracting the books sold in the first and current years from the total books sold:
\[ 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day for five days a week, earning $10 per hour. His weekly earnings from his hourly wage are calculated as follows:

\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the entire month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Martha invited a total of 24 people to her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. This gives us:
\[2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\]

Out of these, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and \(\frac{1}{4}\) of that number had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

"Solomon initially had 50 marbles in his store. He then bought 20 more marbles from his friend Johanna, bringing the total to 70 marbles. His father gave him an additional \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 20 marbles he bought, which is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles. Adding these 8 marbles to the 70 marbles already in the store, Solomon now has a total of 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kilograms, the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**
   The pool dimensions are 6 feet by 4 feet by 5 feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Substituting the given dimensions:
   \[
   V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Cost to Fill the Pool:**
   The cost to fill the pool is the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot. Given that the cost is $0.10 per cubic foot:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can determine the number of girls and nongendered children as follows:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. To find the total number of children in the classroom, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which is 10 people. Therefore, 30 people stayed at the party. Given that 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is \(30 - 22 = 8\).

"The book costs $4, and the magazine costs half as much as the book. Therefore, the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The cost of the pen is $1."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are distributed equally among 3 boxes, each box contains:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, given that each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide 72 by 8:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."
"To determine the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we start by understanding the trade ratio: 2 old records are traded for 1 new record.

Given that the 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   \[
   \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment for senior programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers:**
   - Add the total payments to junior and senior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
2. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
3. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops. He then passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) lollipops. Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops. That night, he eats 3 lollipops, leaving him with \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops. In the morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, so he has \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops left.

"To determine which job provides higher net pay, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

For Job A:
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A).

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
- Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. The number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

We can express these as equations:
\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( C = 20 \) back into the equation \( H = 2C \):
\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]

"Given the problem, we need to determine the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, plus the weight of the container itself.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad:
   - Blue beetle = 50 pounds
   - Green toad = 50 pounds
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake:
   - Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds
5. The container weighs 20 pounds.

Now, we calculate the total weight of the container and the animals:
- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 30 pounds
- Container = 20 pounds

"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, let's break down her earnings and savings step by step.

1. **Initial Savings**: Annabelle already has $80 saved.
2. **First Job Earnings**: She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so her earnings from the first job are:
   \[
   10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Second Job Earnings**: She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so her earnings from the second job are:
   \[
   5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Total Earnings**: Adding her initial savings and the earnings from both jobs, we get:
   \[
   80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. **Amount Needed**: The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs to save is:
   \[
   400 - 355 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one complete trip between the three cities and then find out how many days it takes to accumulate 18,000 miles.

1. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
2. The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
3. The distance from the third city back to the first city is \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles.

The total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first calculate the total number of gifts she needs to wrap. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. Adding these together gives:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for the bows. To find out how much ribbon she can use for each gift, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, the number of inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. Given that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we need to determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we determine the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Tim decides to cancel his $60 cable subscription and switch to streaming services. He subscribes to Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus, normally costing $10 each, are bundled at a 20% discount. 

First, calculate the discounted cost for Hulu and Disney Plus:
- The combined cost without discount is $10 + $10 = $20.
- With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced to 80% of $20, which is $20 \times 0.80 = $16.

Now, add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- Total monthly cost for streaming services = $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package:
- Savings = $60 (cable cost) - $26 (streaming cost) = $34.

Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. To find the percentage of her total work time spent editing, we first calculate the total time spent on each activity:

- Writing a song: 4 hours
- Recording: \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours
- Editing: 90 minutes, which is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours

The total work time is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

The time spent editing is 1.5 hours. To find the percentage of the total work time spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"To determine the number of books Wendy needs to place in the shelving system, we start by calculating the total number of slots available. Given that the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of slots. Therefore, we can express the number of books \( x \) as:

\[ x = 2 \times 36 + 20 \]

Calculating the right-hand side of the equation:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Thus, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Erica initially made 20 Valentine's cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards, so she received an additional \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards. Therefore, Erica had a total of \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards initially.

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 cards to her family, which totals \(24 + 5 = 29\) cards. Additionally, she received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find out how many cards Erica now has, we need to subtract the cards she gave away and add the cards she received:

\[50 - 29 + 17 = 38\]

Therefore, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards."
"Jenny starts with a pizza that has 12 slices. She gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill and \( \frac{1}{4} \) to Mark. First, we calculate the number of slices given to each person:

- Slices given to Bill: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) slices
- Slices given to Mark: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) slices

Next, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices herself. Therefore, we subtract the slices she eats and the slices given to Bill and Mark from the total number of slices:
\[ 12 - 7 - 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

The number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike that costs $300, starting with $50 in his bank account and earning $10 per day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Mark needs to save: $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (initial amount in the bank) = $250.
2. Determine the number of days required to save $250 if he earns $10 per day: $250 / $10 per day = 25 days.

Therefore, the number of days Mark needs to save is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes she saw is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the number of spiders, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12. Therefore, the number of stink bugs is:

\[
2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

To find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[
90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is:

\[
\boxed{168}
\]"
"Given that Erica is 30 years old, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = 30 + 5 = 35 \]

Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = 35 + 7 = 42 \]

The difference between Alice's and Erica's ages is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 42 - 30 = 12 \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To determine the builder's annual earnings, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.
2. Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.
3. Calculate the total earnings based on the daily pay.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a month.**

The builder works for 6 days every week and there are 4 weeks in a month.
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days the builder works in a year.**

There are 12 months in a year.
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings based on the daily pay.**

The builder gets paid $50 every day.
\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, the builder earns \(\boxed{14400}\) dollars in a year."
"To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy for a quadruple batch of brownies, we start by calculating the required amounts of each ingredient.

For flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups
- Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark needs \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

For milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups
- Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark needs \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

To find the difference:
- Bags of flour: 6
- Bottles of milk: 2
- Difference: \(6 - 2 = 4\)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

**Final Answer: 4**"
"To determine the energy savings, we first calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when used for 8 hours a day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, so for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the energy consumption if the usage is reduced to 3 hours a day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to calculate the total number of stripes. Jane counts:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
- Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

Adding these together, the total number of stripes is:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Since there are 4 zebras in total, the average number of stripes per zebra is:
\[\frac{88}{4} = 22\]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the meat and cheese Tyson needs for the muffaletta sandwiches, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - There are 20 people in total.
   - Number of sandwiches needed = \(\frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat needed = \(5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}\).
   - For 5 sandwiches, the total amount of cheese needed = \(5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1 \text{ pound per sandwich} = 5 \text{ pounds}\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of meat = \(5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese:**
   - The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
   - Total cost of cheese = \(5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}\).

5. **Calculate the total cost of meat and cheese:**
   - Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = \(35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Corns:**
   - We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis.
   - He has 40 cannolis.
   - Therefore, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **New Number of Cannolis:**
   - Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   - The new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **New Number of Corns:**
   - Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.
   - He bought 60 cannolis, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
   - The new total number of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Combined Total:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.
   - The new total number of corns is 60.
   - The combined total is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is \(10,000 / 2 = 5,000\) steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he had taken before his jog, we subtract the remaining steps from his daily goal:
\[10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000\]

Next, we calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog by adding the steps from his walks to and from school and the short walk with his friend:
\[5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000\]

The steps taken during his jog are the difference between the steps taken before the jog and the total steps taken before the jog:
\[8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000\]

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time required for him to read the book and then account for the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, determine the time it takes for Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After finishing the book, it takes him an additional 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time from the start of reading until he leaves for the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, the number of minutes early he will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"To determine the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we can break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total payment for May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for one employee in May: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars
   - Total payment for all employees in May: \( 600 \times 40 = 24000 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the number of employees remaining after June:**
   - Number of employees who left in June: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate the total payment for June:**
   - Number of employees in June: 30
   - Payment per employee per hour: $15
   - Hours worked per week: 40
   - Total payment for one employee in June: \( 15 \times 40 = 600 \) dollars

"Sally went to the seashore and had $10 to spend. She bought taffy at a special sale where she could get 2 pounds for $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since the second pound was half off). Additionally, she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

First, calculate the cost of the taffy:
- Cost of the first pound: $3
- Cost of the second pound (half off): $3 / 2 = $1.50
- Total cost for taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50

Next, calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of 4 magnets: 4 × $0.25 = $1.00
- Total cost for seashells and magnets: $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50

Now, add up the total cost of all items:
- Total cost: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00

Finally, subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Sally had:
- Money left: $10 - $7.00 = $3.00

Therefore, the amount of money Sally has left is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars. Therefore, the cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
5. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together, we get:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

Thus, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cookies into dozens.

Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode. We know the following:

- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and will explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price.

The discounted price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Tom's total distance traveled during his two-week-long trip can be calculated as follows:

1. **First 4 days**: He traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   \[
   200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Next 2 days**: He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   \[
   800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Next day**: He did not travel at all.
   \[
   0 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Second week**: He traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   \[
   300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
   \]

Adding all these distances together:
\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given the relationships between the lockers, we can determine the size of Timothy's locker step by step.

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker size is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker size is:

   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we first need to find the elevation of the comb. Stanley was initially at 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, so the comb is now at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The correct answer is 3,000 feet."
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave him $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000, we get:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which totals to:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we get:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is \(28 - 6 = 22\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - So, the savings from the jogger jeans is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) dollars.
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

3. **Determine the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22.
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is $2.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is \(22 + 2 = 24\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference is \(28 - 24 = 4\) dollars.

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name to get the total:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so the total for the utensils is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:

"To determine how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Therefore, the amount of gasoline she needed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, the number of pints of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candy bars George bought after purchasing 3 bags of chips and spending a total of $5, with 1% of his money left.

First, calculate the amount of money George had left:
\[ 5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, determine how much money George spent:
\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

Calculate the cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Determine the number of candy bars bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the length from yards to feet. Given that 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

- After trading 3 sapphires, she has \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires.
- The value of these 5 sapphires is \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.

Next, calculate the value of the rubies:
- Jenna receives 2 rubies in the trade.
- The value of these 2 rubies is \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

Finally, add the value of the sapphires and rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
- Total value = value of sapphires + value of rubies
- Total value = \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

First, the volume of one raised bed is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, the total volume of soil required for 10 raised beds is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 \, \text{cubic feet} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} = 160 \, \text{bags} \]

Since each bag costs $12, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \, \text{bags} \times 12 \, \text{dollars per bag} = 1920 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the potting soil is:
\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To find the total number of cards, we need to determine the number of each color of card and then sum them up.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"

"Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They are on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer, and she has a $2.00 coupon. To find the cost per individual razor, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost for 2 packs with the sale:**
   - Since the sale is ""buy one get one free,"" Heather only pays for 1 pack when buying 2 packs.
   - The cost for 1 pack is $4.00.

2. **Apply the coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Determine the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Calculate the cost per razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett is currently 14, three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela's current age is 38.**"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the total cost for both his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by calculating the amount each used individually.

\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein, so the amount her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total yards of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma is:
\[

"Given the problem, we need to determine the length of the couch based on the dimensions of the rug and the chair.

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the width of the rug is:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, twice the width of the rug is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Adding 2 feet to this value gives the length of the couch:
   \[
   16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the length of the couch is \(\boxed{18}\) feet."
"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and stick yield of the available wood types. A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while a 2 x 8 piece costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, we should calculate how many pieces of each type of wood he can buy and the corresponding number of sticks he can produce.

First, let's calculate the number of 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]
Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will provide:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]
Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will provide:
\[ 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Comparing the two options, buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood yields the maximum number of sticks, which is 1600.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ \boxed{1600} \]"
"To determine the total cost for the snowshoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the snowshoes is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.

First, let's determine the number of cows in the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

Next, let's determine the number of sheep on the farm:
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, we can calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

**Final Answer:**

\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Converting this into hours, we get:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - She has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of chairs Ophelia has is \(20 + 2 = 22\).

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is \(3 \times 22 = 66\).

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of sofas Jenna has is \(66 - 2 = 64\).

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Jenna has 64 sofas.
   - Therefore, the total number of sofas is \(20 + 64 = 84\).

5. **Calculate the total number of chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 22 chairs.
   - Jenna has 66 chairs.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs is \(22 + 66 = 88\).

6. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total number of sofas and chairs is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, paying a total of $48. To find the cost of the headphone set, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, we calculate the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining Jame's current age. Since Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we calculate Jame's age in 8 years, which will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\).

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55, giving us \(55 - 8 = 47\).

The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, determine the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

Finally, find the cost of one monitor by dividing the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"Each boy brought back 60 seashells. The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. Therefore, each girl brought:

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188

"To determine how many vlogs Emma should make in the fourth week to meet her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To determine how much you end up paying, let's break down the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the tip:**
   - The original bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - Tip amount = 0.20 * $50 = $10.

2. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - Total bill = Original bill + Tip = $50 + $10 = $60.

3. **Determine the amount each person pays:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays = $60 / 2 = $30.

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"

"Let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \).

Given:
- Shiloh's current age, \( S = 44 \).
- In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \).

Let's express the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"Peter has $70 to spend over the course of one week. He spends an equal amount each day, so he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After Wednesday, he has:

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."

"Given that 90 single use contacts come in one box and will last Pete 45 days, and each box is priced at $100.00 with a current 10% discount, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts if Pete buys 2 boxes.

First, calculate the discounted price of one box:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
\[ \text{Total cost for 2 boxes} = 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Since each box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes will contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \text{Cost per contact} = \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

"To determine the total number of legs the pets in the store have, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Next, we add the number of legs from all the pets together:

\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

Therefore, the total number of legs the pets in the store have is:

\(\boxed{48}\)"
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases this by 50%, so the new weight is:

\[ 8 + 0.5 \times 8 = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since the 12-pound weight is too heavy, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. Therefore, the weight he now uses is:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight that Jamaal now uses is \(\boxed{10}\) pounds."

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the earnings from the first four hours and the earnings from the next two hours.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, we add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out have a price of $35. 

First, calculate the discount on the shirt:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts do not have a discount, so they will cost:
\[ 35 \]

Now, add the cost of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to buy both items. Therefore, he will have:
\[ 50 - 52.50 = -2.50 \]

However, since he cannot make the purchase, the amount of money Joe will have left is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine how much butter Juan will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan plans to make in a week.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000

"Given the scenario, we need to determine how many men can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet when 100 surfers are riding it. We know that only 25% of the riders can stay upright, and of those, 60% are women.

First, calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:
\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Next, determine the number of women who can stay upright:
\[ 25 \times 0.60 = 15 \]

Since the total number of riders who can stay upright is 25, and 15 of them are women, the remaining riders must be men:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

"Max bought stamps at the post office. He purchased 16 snowflake stamps, 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, and 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Snowflake Stamps**: Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. **Truck Stamps**: Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, which means he bought \(16 + 3 = 19\) truck stamps.
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, which means he bought \(19 - 9 = 10\) rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps, we sum the number of each type of stamp:
\[
16 + 19 + 10 = 45
\]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:

\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, the time it takes for Tom to catch up is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

5 hours"

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by setting up the inequality based on the given information.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss.

The number of classes Manny attends is \( 10 - x \). The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. To find the total weekly production for the two, we first determine the number of customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie is twice as fast, she processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:

   - Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.

4. Calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost of 5 oranges is \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

5. Calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
   - The total cost is \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges is \(\boxed{12.00}\) dollars."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Next, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) it will take him to shovel 72 cubic feet of earth is:

"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Roger buys a week's worth of coffee at a more expensive brand that costs 20% more than the normal brand, which originally costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand thus costs:

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week, he buys:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

- Cost of 2 bags of chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\)
- Cost of the bucket of fried chicken: \$8.00
- Cost of the bottle of soda: \$1.00

Adding these amounts together:
\[ \$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00 \]

"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class.
2. Determine how many recipes he learns based on the total hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spends in the class. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, and it lasts for 6 weeks. Therefore, the total number of hours is:

\[
4 \text{ times/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/time} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes John learns. He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. Therefore, the number of recipes he learns is:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes}
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"Given that 60% of the 150 teachers on the basketball court are history teachers, we first calculate the number of history teachers:

\[ 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

This means there are 90 history teachers. The remaining teachers are math teachers, so we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Thus, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how much money each person would have if Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia decided to share their combined money equally.

First, we find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"

"Christina records her mood over 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral. Given the specific distribution of her moods, we can break it down as follows:

- First 8 days were good.
- Next 8 days were bad.
- Following 8 days were neutral.
- The remaining 6 days were distributed as 2 good, 1 neutral, and 3 good days.

To find the number of good days left in the month, we start by confirming the total number of neutral days:
\[ \text{Total days} = 30 \]
\[ \text{Good days} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Bad days} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Neutral days} = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10 \]

Now, accounting for the specific days:
- First 8 days were good.
- Next 3 days were 2 good and 1 neutral.
- The last 3 days were 2 good and 1 neutral.

Summarizing the good days:
- Initial 8 good days.
- Next 2 good days.
- Last 2 good days.

Total good days:
\[ 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 \]

Since the total number of good days is 12 and we have already accounted for 10 good days, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm. According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn by using both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time:

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies given the cost of individual items.

First, we find the cost of one candy. We know that four candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
Thus, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"

   - Total cost for vaccines = \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

2. Let the total bill be \(x\) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is \(0.6x\) dollars.

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[
   x = 40 + 0.6x
   \]

4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4x = 40
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total number of people in the group. Aiden and his 12 friends make 13 people, and they meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person saves a seat and buys enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats. Since each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks, and there are 20 people, the group will buy 20 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

The cost of each drink is $2, so the total cost for the drinks is:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of each snack is $2, so the total cost for the snacks is:

\[ 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the drinks and the snacks together, the total amount of money spent is:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{160}

"Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which means Gordy's truck can haul \(4000 + 800 = 4800\) pounds. The combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let \(x\) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[4000 + 4800 + x = 11600\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[8800 + x = 11600\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 8800 from both sides:

\[x = 11600 - 8800\]
\[x = 2800\]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the dumplings consumed by both males and females and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of dumplings each group ate:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

2. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:**
   - There are 6 females, and each ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

3. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:**
   - There are 8 males, and each ate 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

4. **Calculate the total number of dumplings cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = dumplings eaten by females + dumplings eaten by males.
   - Total dumplings = \(18 + 32 = 50\).

Therefore, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"Given that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second, we can determine the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

To find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first calculate the remaining amount needed. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we find the hourly rate of fundraising. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

To find out how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours needed is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the percentage of the river's water used by the city for industrial purposes.
2. Subtract the industrial usage percentage from the total city usage percentage to find the non-industrial usage percentage.

Step 1: Calculate the industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\% \]

Step 2: Calculate the non-industrial usage percentage.
The city uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes. Therefore, the remaining percentage is for non-industrial purposes.
\[ \text{Non-industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"Erin can take advantage of the ice cream parlor's deal, which is buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. To determine how many scoops Erin can get with $6.00, we first calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):

\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

This means for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops. With $6.00, she can afford 2 sets of this deal:

\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:

\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the number of scoops Erin can get is:

"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate how many slices were eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Given that Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, we convert this to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we use the information that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) represent the length of Bobby's shoe in inches. The relationship can be expressed as:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Then, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which amounts to \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers. Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons from this trade.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers. Each large sticker is worth a large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from this trade.

She has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons. Therefore, she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons from trading the remaining large stickers.

Adding up all the buttons, she has 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons in total.

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles (since it needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{100}\) cases of shingles."

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Let \( E_b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
   - Let \( E_t \) be the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

2. Calculate the points for Emma:
   - Points for enemies: \( 10E_e \)
   - Points for berries: \( 5E_b \)
   - Points for time: \( 30E_t \)
   - Total score for Emma: \( \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \)

3. Calculate the points for Ava:
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Bob initially had 7 fish: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **After Buying More Fish:**
   - Let \( O \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of white fish Bob bought.
   - Total fish bought: \( O + W = 17 \).

3. **Final Condition:**
   - After adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - This gives us the equation: \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \).

4. **Simplify the Final Condition Equation:**
   \[
   3 + O = 8 + 2W
   \]
   \[
   O - 2W = 5
   \]

5. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     O + W = 17
     \]
     \[
     O - 2W = 5
     \]

6. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - From \( O + W = 17 \), express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):
     \[
     O = 17 - W
     \]
   - Substitute \( O = 17 - W \) into \( O - 2W = 5 \):
     \[
     17 - W - 2W = 5
     \]
     \[
     17 - 3W = 5
     \]
     \[
     -3W = 5 - 17
     \]
     \[
     -3W = -12
     \]
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If \( W = 4 \), then \( O = 17 - 4 = 13 \).
   - Check the final condition:
     \[
     3 + 13 = 16
     \]
     \[
     4 + 4 = 8
     \]
     \[
     16 = 2 \times 8

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of her total collection, we start by calculating the current total number of stuffed animals she has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

**Final Answer:**

"Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement by playing a total of 30 hours. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks and then for 2 hours every day for a week. Let's calculate the total hours she plays.

First, calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:
- There are 14 days in 2 weeks.
- Playing half an hour each day for 14 days results in \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, calculate the hours played in the following week:
- Playing 2 hours each day for 7 days results in \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, add the hours from both periods:
- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

The final answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. Calculate the distance traveled by the first car in 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. Calculate the distance traveled by the second car in 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. Determine the difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the length of the mosaic Milo can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with the total number of glass chips.
3. Determine the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches Milo can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find the length of the mosaic, we divide the total area by the height:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the length of the mosaic Milo can make is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to account for the tea consumed and the tea remaining.

First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total tea consumed:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \text{ gallons} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

"At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students on campus. The number of students doubles at the end of each month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Given that he charges $0.25 for each branch and made $105 in total, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total earnings by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, to find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**

"John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores and DeSean made 9 S'mores, using a total of:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows lost is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Subtracting the lost marshmallows from the original amount, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the 14 marshmallows can be used to make 14 S'mores. These 14 S'mores are to be shared equally between John and DeSean. Thus, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

The final answer is:

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars.

The final answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. To find out how much money he spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

\[ 3 \text{ goats} \times \$500 \text{ per goat} = \$1500 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the cows:
\[ 2 \text{ cows} \times \$1500 \text{ per cow} = \$3000 \]

Now, add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
\[ \$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Joe initially has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, he gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the number of cars Joe has left is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

So, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how much each student raised, we start by calculating the total amount of money raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."

"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which means Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points. However, the question asks for Sasha's total points over both games. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games together:
\[14 + 4 = 18\]

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

The final answer is:

"Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours initially and then for another 6 hours after a rest. 

For the first part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second part of the journey:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of the journey:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is \(\boxed{80}\) miles."
"To determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway, we start by calculating the total distance \(D\) that the kangaroos travel. Given that three kangaroos, each traveling at speed \(v\), take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). Therefore, the combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time it takes for the four turtles to cross the highway is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Adding the number of clay dishes made by each person:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"Erika is saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one is reduced by $200, making the new price $400. Erika has some savings in her purse, has been paid $150 for her part-time job, and her mom agrees to give her $80. She still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

Since she needs an additional $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

Setting up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Adam starts with 3 large apples and 5 small apples. Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices, and the total number of slices from the small apples is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices. Adding these together, the total number of slices is \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is \(30 - 15 = 15\).

"The farmer currently extracts 5 liters of milk per day from one cow. With 3 cows, the total milk production is:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

To reach a goal of 25 liters of milk per day, the additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help. To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10,000 + \$800 = \$10,800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5,000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5,000 + \$200 = \$5,200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10,800 - \$5,200 = \$5,600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\$5,600\)."

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we can break down the information provided:

- Total number of students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. This can be found by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, we find the total number of students who are good at math by adding those who are good at math only and those who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $300
- Rate (R) = \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the original amount per year, which is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\) dollars per year
- Time (T) = 3 years

First, calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

"To determine how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we start by calculating the total number of petals for each type of flower.

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
- The total number of petals on the daisies is 40.
- The total number of petals on the orchids is 25.
- The difference in the number of petals is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Thus, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we start by calculating the number of indoor plants. Given that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we have:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Thus, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is \( 11v \). Since the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we have:
\[ 11v = 121 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is:
\[ 5v = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

To find a feasible value for \( J \), we need \( L \) to be a non-negative amount. The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J \) is an integer. Let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is \(55 + 16 = 71\) kg. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is \(71 + 8 = 79\) kg. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is \(79 - 5 = 74\) kg.

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. He and his wife are adults, and they have two children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, the total number of bowls needed is 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) plus 2 child bowls (for the children), which equals 4 bowls.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, the total amount of soup in the pot is equivalent to 4 adult bowls. After the family eats their 4 bowls, there is no soup left for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

"Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \]

So, he gives 6 marbles to Jamie. He also gives 10 marbles to Donald. The total number of marbles given away is:

\[ 6 + 10 = 16 \]

Subtracting the total given away from the original amount, we find the number of marbles Dean has left:

\[ 30 - 16 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Given the problem, let's denote Duncan's current age as \( D \) and Adam's current age as \( A \). We know that Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Adding 4 to both sides, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

First, calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, add the sizes of both farms to find the total:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is \(\boxed{700}\)."
"Colby works in the packaging division of a manufacturing company and earns $0.20 for every package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, he completes 40 packages per hour. Over an eight-hour workday, he completes \(40 \times 8 = 320\) packages. Given his pay rate, he earns \(320 \times 0.20 = 64\) dollars in a typical eight-hour workday.

The final answer is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. To find out how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we first calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. We also know that there are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). From the problem, we have:
\[ R = 20 \]

The total number of pieces of bologna can be expressed as:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

To find \( Y \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours. Therefore, the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days is \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

The final answer is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. The total cost of the cake is $11. The balloons, bought in dozens, cost $0.5 for every 2 balloons, so 1 dozen (12 balloons) would cost:
\[
\frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]
The ice cream cost $7 per tub, and they bought 2 tubs, so the total cost for the ice cream is:
\[
2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]
Adding up all the expenses, the total amount spent is:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]
Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance and combined it to make the purchase, each of them must have received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]
Therefore, the amount each of them received from their mother is \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."
"Kira initially bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. This gives a total of \(3 + 5 + 6 = 14\) pieces of fruit. After Lola ate 2 pieces, the number of pieces left is \(14 - 2 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of pieces of fruit left is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the profit the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.**

Given that there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

The profit is:
\[ 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{47}

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down the tree and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"Initially, the pool contains 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half of this amount, which is:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

The tank is then emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget and then figure out how many tickets he can afford with that budget.

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

- **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
- **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
- **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"The bus travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, covering a distance of \(60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}\). The car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, covering a distance of \(30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles}\). The difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car is \(300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles}\).

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to account for all the other toys first. The total number of toys is 62. We know the quantities of the other toys:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we sum these quantities:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of toys to find the number of bouncy balls:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substituting \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation, we have:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Dividing by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
2. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons:
- Balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by Maria's mom: 15

Adding these together, the total number of balloons is:
\[8 + 1 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is:

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then find the revenue generated from selling those widgets.

1. **Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

2. **Calculate the revenue generated by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines:**

   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
   - Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"Cameron arrives at 5 pm and plans to leave at 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours of stay. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and an additional 70 pesos for each hour beyond that.

First, calculate the cost for the first 12 hours:
\[ 1000 \text{ pesos} \]

Next, calculate the cost for the additional 5 hours:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would be:
\[ 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the hay requirement for each type of animal.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

"John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

He then deposits $100 in the bank, leaving him with:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

He spends $10 on each of 5 pencils, so the total spent on pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, he has:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

"James buys 10 CDs at $15 each, which totals to $150. He gets them for 40% off, so the discount is $60 (40% of $150). Therefore, the total cost after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each, which totals to $200. Since he only sold 5 CDs, the net amount he spent on the CDs he kept is $90, and the money he received from selling the CDs is $200. 

The net amount he was out is the initial cost minus the money he received from selling the CDs, which is $90 - $200 = -$110. Since the question asks how much money he was out, and he ended up with more money than he spent, the correct answer is the initial expenditure, which is $90.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{\$90} \]"
"To determine how much Jen will earn from selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of root crop and then sum them up.

   - Total earnings from yams: \( 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \)

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   - Price per sweet potato: $2
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \)

3. **Carrots:**
   - Number of carrots: 4
   - Price per carrot: $1.25
   - Total earnings from carrots: \( 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \)

Now, we sum up the earnings from all the root crops:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the total time it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - Total distance of the lake: 20 miles
   - Percentage of the distance he swims: 60%
   - Distance swum initially: \( 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \) miles

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to calculate the commission from both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal separately and then sum them up.

1. **Commission from the New York Times:**
   - Cayley earns a 10% commission on each copy.
   - Each copy costs $5.
   - He sells 6 copies.
   
   The commission per copy is:
   \[
   5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   
   The total commission from 6 copies is:
   \[
   6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Commission from the Wall Street Journal:**
   - Cayley earns an 8% commission on each copy.
   - Each copy costs $15.
   - He sells 10 copies.
   
   The commission per copy is:
   \[
   15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   
   The total commission from 10 copies is:
   \[
   10 \times 1.20 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Commission:**

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:

\[ \text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21 \]

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can determine Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age:

\[ \text{Leo's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"Given that the paper is stacked such that 100 pages occupy 1 inch and the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

1. First, determine the total number of pages in 1.5 inches of paper:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we divide the total number of pages by 2:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To determine the total number of reports he stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, we first calculate the total time in minutes.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate her total sleep duration, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The time from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total time awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. He has two dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons}
\]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons}
\]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is the sum of his measuring cups and remaining measuring spoons:

\[
24 + 10 = 34

"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with initially 1/5 of the beds occupied. This means there are \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) occupied beds, leaving \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) unoccupied beds.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

Adding these new admissions to the initially occupied beds, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is \( 200 + 700 = 900 \).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \).

The final answer is **100**."
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. The remaining emails are:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Two-thirds of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family:

"Given that Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert and Kelly stated that this number was 20% higher than the actual number, we can set up the equation to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Therefore, the total number of corn chips received by Amora and Lainey together is:
   \[
   70 + 70 = 140
   \]
3. Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so Collins received:
   \[
   70 + 15 = 85
   \]
4. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
   \[
   70 + 70 + 85 = 225
   \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[
\boxed{225}

"Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. To find the cost of the tickets, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the tickets:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"John is watching a new show where each episode is 20 minutes long. The total number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

Thus, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen, which is 6 brownies. When she got home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her, which is 48 brownies. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

To find out how many brownies Greta had left over, we start by adding the brownies she made and received:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we subtract the brownies that were eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. Therefore, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of string and then sum these times.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:

   \]

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string):
   \[
   4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Adding these times together gives:
\[
45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The price of each phone is $600. The first two phones are at full price, so the cost for these is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we start by calculating the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, totaling 4 boxes given away. This leaves her with \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes. She then kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \(2\) boxes. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the books:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25 is:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - Therefore, the number of bottles needed is \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be 5 years from now. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, meaning his dad will be 48 years old. Additionally, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

To find their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Adrianne received beads from her mother, sister, and friend. Her mother gave her 20 metallic beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is 40 beads. Adding these together:

\[ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is 90."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. This means:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

Subtracting the football players from the total number of students gives:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ remaining students} \]

Out of these remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ cheerleaders or band members} \]

Adding the football players and the cheerleaders/band members gives the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's. Since Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie, we calculate:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

"Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) as many pretzels as Edgar, who eats 18 pretzels a day. Therefore, his brother eats \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pretzels a day. Over a week, his brother eats \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \) pretzels.

The final answer is 63."
"To determine the total cost Katherine will spend on filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petunias needed.
2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

First, calculate the total number of petunias needed:
- Each basket requires 3 petunias.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

Next, calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed:
- Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

Now, determine the cost of the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

Next, determine the cost of the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

Finally, add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
- Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"Artemis and her father start with a 30-pound bag of soil. They plant 4 sunflowers, each requiring 3 pounds of soil, and 10 carnations, each requiring 1.5 pounds of soil. 

First, calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the soil used for the carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtract the total soil used from the initial amount to find the remaining soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes she buys costs $1,000.00. To determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we first calculate her monthly savings for shoes:

\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. Over a year, her total savings for shoes would be:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Given that each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, the number of pairs she can buy in a year is:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes separately and then combine the times.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since the peeling and sautering processes are sequential, we add the times together:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer:**
45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To determine Bill's age when he first saw Comet Halley, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. According to the problem, Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet.
2. Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time. The problem states that Bill was three times his dad's age when he saw the comet for the first time. Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
3. Determine the time interval between the two sightings. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.
4. Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider each type of check and calculate the frequency over the course of a year.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. This also amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 2 \times 44 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Calculate the number of flights to Greece:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - So, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).

3. **Calculate the remaining flights:**
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).

4. **Distribute the remaining flights between France and Germany:**
   - The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous are three wolves who howl at the moon. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds. Igneous howls for the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

The total duration of their howls combined is:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60:
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

"Given the information:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the given information, we have:
\[ A = 3 \]
\[ B = 4 \]
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4} \] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ H = 10 \]

Now, using \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes, and \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the equation for Peter is:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the equation for Martha is:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

We solve these equations for \( p \) and \( m \):
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Next, we find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes:

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

First, we calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
Given the dimensions:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting these values in, we get:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

**First Day:**
- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water pumped on the first day:
  \[
  4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Second Day:**
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water pumped on the second day:
  \[
  3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}

**Remaining Capacity:**
\[
18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6000}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for a $10,000 car, we first calculate her total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we calculate the amount she needs to save for the down payment, which is 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Janet works 40 hours a week, so her weekly earnings are:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

\[
\boxed{2}

"Jamaar has $10 to spend on fresh fruits. The prices are as follows: peaches and pears are $0.50 each, apples are $0.75 each, kiwis are $1.00 each, and plums are $0.25 each. He has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples.

First, we calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:
- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total spent so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Subtracting this from the initial $10, we find the remaining amount:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack holding 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself and distributed the rest equally among her 10 friends.

First, calculate the total number of sweets:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, determine the number of packs given to her friends:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

Then, calculate the total number of sweets given to her friends:
\[ 13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 780 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, divide the total number of sweets given to her friends by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received:
\[ \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Therefore, each of her friends received:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To determine the number of portraits and selfies Olivia has, we start by calculating the number of pictures in each album. Given that Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and evenly distributed them into 8 albums, we find the number of pictures per album as follows:

\[ \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Next, we know that 3 albums contain only selfies and 2 albums contain only portraits. Therefore, the total number of selfies is:

\[ \text{Selfies} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \]

And the total number of portraits is:

\[ \text{Portraits} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of portraits and selfies:

\[ \text{Total portraits and selfies} = 27 + 18 = 45 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[

"In a 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided between average and difficult questions. We need to determine how many points Aries is sure to get, given her performance on each type of question.

First, calculate the number of easy questions:
\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Next, determine the number of average and difficult questions:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]
Since these are equally divided:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ (average questions)} \]
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ (difficult questions)} \]

Now, calculate the number of easy questions Aries is sure to get correct:

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \(L\). According to the problem, \(L = 3S\). Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \(S = 4\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(L = 3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the ore mining rate for a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe. We know that:

1. A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

Next, we calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month with 30 days. Each dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day, so 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day. Over 30 days, the total ore mined is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed for college:**
   - Jim borrows $50,000 per year for 4 years.
   - Total amount borrowed = $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Calculate the money Jim would have earned if he had continued working:**
   - Jim's annual income before college was $25,000.
   - In 4 years, he would have earned = $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.

3. **Calculate the total money lost from not working while in school:**
   - Total money lost = $100,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off his loans and the money lost from not working:**
   - Total amount to earn = Total amount borrowed + Total money lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

5. **Calculate Jim's new annual income after earning a college degree:**
   - His new income is triple his previous income.
   - New annual income = $25,000 * 3 = $75,000.

6. **Calculate how long it would take to earn the total amount of $300,000:**
   - Time required = Total amount to earn / New annual income = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

Therefore, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's deliveries. One-fifth of Monday's deliveries is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \). Therefore, Tuesday's deliveries are \( 85 + 17 = 102 \). On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice Tuesday's deliveries. Twice Tuesday's deliveries is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \), so Wednesday's deliveries are \( 204 + 5 = 209 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the average loss per race.

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Win: \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Loss: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

Now, let's calculate the total loss and total win:

- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).
- Total win: \(11\).

Net result:
- Net loss: \(21.5 - 11 = 10.5\).

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

Therefore, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."
"To determine the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Converting this to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights is:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the daily work time into hours:**
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - The team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"Given that there are 50 books in the library, we can determine the number of books written in each language as follows:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required and then multiply by the cost per tile.

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"James's insurance cost after the accident is 60% more than the normal cost of $120 per month. First, we calculate the increased amount:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses and then figure out how many loads are required based on the machine's capacity.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption of cat food for all three cats and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so the daily consumption for one cat is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption to find out how many days the food will last:

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtracting 18 from both sides, we have:

\[2D = 80\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

"Maggie and Riza each have $60 left after spending portions of their original amounts.

First, let's determine Maggie's original amount of money. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has three-quarters left. If three-quarters of her original amount is $60, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{4}M = 60
\]
Solving for \(M\):
\[
M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter, she has $60 left.

Next, let's determine Riza's original amount of money. Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has two-thirds left. If two-thirds of her original amount is $60, we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{3}R = 60
\]
Solving for \(R\):
\[
R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third, she has $60 left.

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remaining amount for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   In a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. The total number of bananas bought is 315, so the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. Since the third monkey eats the same number of bananas each day, the number of bananas it eats each day is:
   \[
   \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved, we calculate:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture. Therefore, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for.
3. Determine the discount amount from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount.

First, the original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

The discount amount from the original price is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

2. **Determine the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, calculate the total cost if Jenny were to buy these bananas individually at $0.80 each:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, calculate the total cost for buying 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour, while the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Therefore, the net increase in the number of hay bales in the field each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales. Over a 6-hour day, the total number of bales added to the field is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

Thus, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"John has 8 classes each day, consisting of 6 normal periods and 2 extra classes. Each class is 40 minutes long. Therefore, the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of Saturday and Sunday for extra learning. Thus, the extra learning time on each of these days is:

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 6 hours a week learning."

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the total area for these two walls is:
\[2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet}\]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the total area for these two walls is:
\[2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet}\]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:

"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

Initially, there are 12 sodas:
- 3 are shaken
- 9 are unshaken

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda:
- Shaken sodas: 3
- Unshaken sodas: 9 - 1 = 8

Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas:
- Shaken sodas: 3 - 1 = 2
- Unshaken sodas: 8 - 2 = 6

Now, there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left. The total number of sodas is 8.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Expressing this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

"Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by finding the total population of the school. Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

Solving for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. Therefore, the number of girls is:

\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers over 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed to complete the order:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys and still needs 20 more toys to complete the order.
   - Therefore, the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the hourly production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Given that Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds, we can calculate the weights of Elijah’s dogs as follows:

"Let's define the variables for the number of eggs painted by each person:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, substitute the expression for \( C \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, use the total number of eggs painted:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Finally, find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over this period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we start by identifying the quantities of the other colored jellybeans. We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Given that the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60, the number of blue jellybeans is the difference between the total and the sum of green and red jellybeans:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"Given the ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9 and the total number of passengers is 84, we can determine the number of men and women initially.

Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\). The total number of passengers is the sum of men and women:

\[5x + 9x = 84\]
\[14x = 84\]
\[x = 6\]

Using \(x = 6\), we find the number of men and women:

\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The cost of one sunflower is $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - The cost of one bouquet is $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
     \[
     97 \times 3 = 291
     \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand. Each rock costs $5, so he can buy:

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we start by identifying the individual probabilities of winning for each ticket.

Given:
- The probability of winning for the first ticket, \( P_1 \), is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so the probability of winning for the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of seashells each person collected. Let's denote the number of seashells Carrey collected as \( C \).

Given that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, Carlos collected \( 2C \) seashells. Jim collected 27 seashells, which is 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, we can write the equation for Carlos's seashells as:
\[ 2C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ 2C = 22 \]
\[ C = 11 \]

So, Carrey collected 11 seashells. Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, Carlos collected:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, we sum the seashells collected by Jim, Carlos, and Carrey:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \text{ seashells} \]

They decided to divide the seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people, each person will get:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ seashells} \]

Thus, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays (Monday through Friday), which totals to \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots. On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he eats 5 carrots each day, which totals to \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots. Adding these together, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots in a week.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Linus works for a trading company. He buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. If he bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, how much profit was he able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the devices bought.
3. Determine the total revenue from selling the devices.
4. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.**
The selling price is twice the original price.
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the devices bought.**
Linus bought a total of 6 devices (2 on Monday and 4 on Tuesday).
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling the devices.**
Linus sold all 6 devices at $40 each.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit.**
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

"To satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we need to calculate the total number of bottles required.

Each bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, 5 bottles are needed (since \(100\% / 20\% = 5\)).

For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
\[ 2300 \times 5 = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. The additional number of bottles needed is:
\[ 11500 - 4200 = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Number of Octuplets**: 8
2. **Number Dressed in Purple**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)
3. **Number Dressed in Blue**: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Next, we calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\).

So, the total number of bow-wearers is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

We need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Converting this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it for $50, which is 40 square meters. This means he sold 40 square meters for $50, so the price per square meter is $1.25 (since \( \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \)).

Next, he sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining 40 square meters for $30. This is 10 square meters, and the price per square meter is $3 (since \( \frac{30}{10} = 3 \)).

After these two sales, he has 30 square meters left. He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter, which amounts to \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

Adding up all the money he earned, we get:
\[ 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard for the Easter egg hunt, which totals to \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

The total number of eggs found by all four is \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(36 - 27 = 9\).

The final answer is:

"To determine how much money John makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Find the total number of apartments across all three complexes.
3. Determine the total number of collections per week.
4. Calculate the total earnings based on the payment per collection.

First, the third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined number of the first two complexes. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:
\[200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}\]

The third complex is 60% bigger than 400 apartments:
\[400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}\]

Adding the apartments from all three complexes:
\[200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}\]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment, so the total number of collections per week is:
\[1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}\]

He gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his total earnings per week are:
\[3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\]

Therefore, the amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[\boxed{1248}\]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the production for each year based on the given information.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, \(x = 20 \times 50 = 1000\). Thus, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1650}\)."

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28, \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Substitute these expressions into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

Therefore, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we first need to calculate the number of pods in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. The cost per pod in the special size box is:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"In the first half of the soccer match, Team A scores 4 goals while Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals. Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

The total number of goals scored by Team A is \(4 + 2 = 6\), and the total number of goals scored by Team B is \(2 + 8 = 10\). Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher can use the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we start with the initial length of the chalk, which is 5 inches. On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, leaving him with 55% of the original length.

\[ \text{Remaining chalk after Monday} = 5 \times (1 - 0.45) = 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher then uses 20% of the remaining chalk each subsequent day. We need to calculate how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \( n \) days as \( C_n \). We start with \( C_0 = 2.75 \) inches.

- After the first day, \( C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \) inches.
- After the second day, \( C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \) inches.
- After the third day, \( C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \) inches.
- After the fourth day, \( C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \) inches.
- After the fifth day, \( C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \) inches.

Since \( C_5 = 0.90112 \) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class consists of 12 boys and 12 girls. One-third of the girls and one-fourth of the boys are on varsity. To find the number of students not on varsity, we first calculate the number of girls and boys on varsity.

For the girls:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

For the boys:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Adding these together gives the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

Subtracting the number of students on varsity from the total number of students gives the number of students not on varsity:
\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To determine the refund amount, we first calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is based on the cost of the sour milk:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the refund amount is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends will consume.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

Thus, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- The number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- The number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for both the snowballs he builds and those that melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 fifteen-minute intervals.
   - In each fifteen-minute interval, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - Since 2 snowballs melt every fifteen minutes, the net gain per interval is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how many fifteen-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Each interval is 15 minutes, so the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is: \(12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\)

The number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the height of the first floor to the ceiling is:
\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Let \( h \) be the height of the second floor. Therefore:
\[ 180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for \( h \):

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles required for all four dogs based on the given average. The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles, so the total miles for all dogs is:

\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:

\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. The weights are as follows:

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight of the tunas:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines for $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]

Next, we calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Thus, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she makes can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

So, Carly made \(\boxed{3}\) cupcakes."
"To determine the total cost Karen would pay, we need to follow these steps:

"In November, the toy was priced at $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price after the increase, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
\[
\text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
\]
\[
\text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
\]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price after the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:
\[
\text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which is \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Adding these together, the total capacity of one bookcase is:
\[20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}\]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[\frac{110}{55} = 2\]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

**Final Answer: 2**"
"Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 per dozen. First, we calculate the total cost:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we determine the total number of eggs:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Skyler has a total of 100 hats, with colors red, blue, and white. 

1. First, we determine the number of red hats:
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

2. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50
   \]

3. Next, we calculate the number of blue hats, which is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

4. Finally, the number of white hats is the remainder after accounting for the red and blue hats:
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) additional kernels pop.

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:

"To determine the total cost for the family's visit to the cinema, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then sum them up.

1. The cost of an adult ticket is $12. Since there are 2 parents, the total cost for the adult tickets is:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The cost of a child ticket is $8. Since there is 1 child, the total cost for the child ticket is:
   \[
   1 \times 8 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. The cost of each popcorn is $3, and they buy 2 popcorns, so the total cost for the popcorns is:
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[
24 + 8 + 6 = 38 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount they pay is \(\boxed{38}\) dollars."
"To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, their combined weight is:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weight of the car, luggage, and children together gives:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight. Therefore, we calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence:
- Length = 20 feet
- Width = 15 feet

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ P = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

\[
\boxed{70}

"Given that Mia is 40 years old and she is 16 years younger than Emma, we can determine Emma's age by adding 16 years to Mia's age. Therefore, Emma is \(40 + 16 = 56\) years old.

To find the average of their ages, we use the formula for the average of two numbers:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
\]

Thus, the average of their ages is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells they found together and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

1. Calculate the total number of seashells:
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.
   - Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86

\[
214 + 432 = 646
\]
\[
646 + 86 = 732
\]

So, the total number of seashells found is 732.

2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:
   - Number of cracked seashells = 67
   - Total good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells

\[
732 - 67 = 665
\]

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is \(\boxed{665}\)."

- Bowl: $5.00

Adding these together, the cost for one place setting is:
\[ 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00 \]

Avery is having 12 people over for dinner, so she needs 12 place settings. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 15.00 \times 12 = 180.00 \]

Thus, the total amount Avery will spend on place settings is:
\[ \boxed{180.00} \]"
"To determine how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we start by calculating half of Steve's time. Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle, so half of his time is:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Anna took 2 hours more than this half-time, so we add 2 hours to 5 hours:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

The final answer is:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \]"
"Dexter has five pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption for all pigs over the week.

1. **Daily Feed Consumption for One Pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so the daily consumption for one pig is:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for All Five Pigs:**
   Dexter has five pigs, so the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption for All Five Pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Remaining Feed After a Week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the remaining feed after a week is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Thus, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. Therefore, the number of packs John needs to buy is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each and 40 cookies at $1 each. The total earnings from cupcakes are \(20 \times 2 = \$40\), and the total earnings from cookies are \(40 \times 1 = \$40\). Therefore, her total earnings are \(40 + 40 = \$80\).

She then buys five trays at $4 each, which costs \(5 \times 4 = \$20\).

Subtracting the cost of the trays from her total earnings, we get \(80 - 20 = \$60\).

Thus, the amount of money Frances has left is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - Number of new children joining = 5 (one for each of the original 5 children).
   - Total number of children now = 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - Number of new children joining = 10 (original 10 children) × 2 = 20.
   - Total number of children now = 10 (original) + 20 (new) = 30.

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children leave the group.
   - Total number of children now = 30 (current total) - 5 (original 5 children who left) = 25.

So, the final number of children following the truck is:
```
25

Adding these amounts together:
25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents

Therefore, the total amount of money James has is 105 cents."
"Given the information:
- There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.
- All 3 sisters are 16 years old.
- One brother is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.

From this, we can deduce that the older brother is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old.

Now, let's calculate the total age of all the siblings:
- Total age of the 3 sisters: \(3 \times 16 = 48\)
- Age of the 12-year-old brother: \(12\)
- Age of the older brother: \(24\)

Adding these together gives us the total age of all the siblings:
\[48 + 12 + 24 = 84\]

Therefore, the total age of all these siblings is \(\boxed{84}\)."

- Total amount = $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores. He did his chores for 3 weeks. Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each. How many movie tickets can Ryan buy?

First, calculate the total allowance Ryan earned over 3 weeks:
\[ 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones:
\[ 4 \, \text{people} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/person} = 5 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the total allowance to find the remaining money:
\[ 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 2 \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, Ryan can buy \(\boxed{2}\) movie tickets."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor actually brought. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so \( x \) beakers were lost, meaning Igor brought \( 7 - x \) beakers.

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is given as 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + (7 - x) \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 29 from 31:

\[ x = 31 - 29 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench, which means he lost \( 7 - 5 = 2 \) beakers.

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock. Therefore, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

He already has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.**
- Number of nights the restaurant is open per week: 2
- Total cost per week: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the total amount made in a week is \(\$180\)."
"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given a profit of 25%. The selling price per watermelon is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of the individuals involved and then find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is now 18, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - The youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is now 37, the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of the youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of John's youngest son in 3 years will be \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Mark's car needs a new radiator, which costs $400. He gets it at a junk shop with an 80% discount, meaning he pays 20% of the original price.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, he hires a mechanic to install the radiator, which takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Adding the cost of the radiator and the labor cost gives the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the final amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. Set up the equations based on the given information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( c + k = 20 \).
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \).

3. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[ c + 2k = 35 \]

4. We now have the system of equations:
   \[ c + k = 20 \]
   \[ c + 2k = 35 \]

5. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   \[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
   \[ k = 15 \]

6. Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   \[ c + 15 = 20 \]
   \[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"To solve the problem, we first calculate the total number of pizza slices available. Given that there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices each person can have. Since Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
