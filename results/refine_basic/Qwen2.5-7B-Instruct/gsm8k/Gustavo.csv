"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. 

First, calculate the distance for one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Then, calculate the total distance for the week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens.
2. Determine the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing pattern: the first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

1. Cost of the first glass: $5
2. Cost of the second glass: $3
3. Total cost for one pair of glasses: $5 + $3 = $8

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the number of pairs as follows:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Sheep in Toulouse + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of:
\[ 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

On his return trip, he spends:
- 2 hours in standstill traffic (0 miles covered),
- 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering:
\[ 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]
- The remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering:
\[ 80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Total distance covered on the return trip is:
\[ 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles} \]

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home and has covered 135 miles on his return trip, the distance remaining from home is:
\[ 180 - 135 = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"Eliza's regular pay rate is $10 per hour for the first 40 hours. For the 5 hours of overtime, she earns 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $12 per hour.

Regular earnings: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
Overtime earnings: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, the correct answer is:
$460"
"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
5. Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
6. Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
7. Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
8. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance. This means:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

After 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance, the remaining number of students is:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, the number of students left to enroll in hip-hop dance is:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we calculate:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's define the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
2. Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

   - The total cost is \(15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Gustavo here!

John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, so he earns:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games at $20 each, spending:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total money he had initially minus the cost of the video games and the leftover money is:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, with 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days.

Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour.

1. **Distance on the first day:**
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance on the other two days:**
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so:
     \[
     3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so:
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running (one-third of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking (two-thirds of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."
"Given the relationships between the ages of the iPhones:

2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her usual distance of 400 feet. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and the calories you have already consumed, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine the calories per gram:**
   - Total calories = 1250 calories.
   - Total weight = 300g.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

3. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Daily calorie target = 2000 calories.
   - Calories already consumed = 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

4. **Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Calories per gram = 4.17 calories/g.
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g â‰ˆ 48 grams.

   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics. She writes an average of 4 hours per article. Let's break down the number of articles she wrote each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchase.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes used at work.
3. Use the information about the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes left after work is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 \]

We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we start by determining the square footage of each level. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16 and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. **Top level (Level 1):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 2:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **Level 3:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **Level 4:** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ \boxed{7.5} \]"
"Cecilia has to feed her new puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then, she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. We need to find out how many bags of dog food, each containing 110 cups, Cecilia will use in the first year.

First, calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, determine how many bags of dog food are needed for these 180 cups:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636 \]

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry.
3. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4D = 400
   \]
4. Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]
   Therefore, David does 100 pounds of laundry.
5. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:
   \[
   \frac{400}{2} = 200
   \]
   So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.
6. The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) gives us the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. Here's the breakdown of his TV watching:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Thursday: 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 one-hour episodes, so \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- Total TV watching: 7 hours.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

Setting up the equation for the total hours of TV watched:

\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon:

2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon:
   \[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost:
   \[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each of them ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row:**
   - It takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - The rate of rowing is \( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \).
   - The total distance to the shore is \( \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \).

2. **Determine the rate of water intake:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - The rate of water intake is \( \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - Total distance rowed is 80 feet.
   - Total water taken on is \( 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \).

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1800 = 6 \times \text{(Brittany's phone capacity)} \]
Solving for Brittany's phone capacity:
\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let's denote the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \). Therefore:
\[ 300 = 50 \times D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total selling price of the lumber she has.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- Sasha bought ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each, so the cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).
- She also bought five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each, so the cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).
- Therefore, the total cost is \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

Next, let's calculate the total selling price:
- The price of the 2x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is \(10 \times 1.5 = \$15\). The total selling price for these boards is \(10 \times 15 = \$150\).
- The price of the 4x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is \(16 \times 1.5 = \$24\). The total selling price for these boards is \(5 \times 24 = \$120\).
- Therefore, the total selling price is \(150 + 120 = \$270\).

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = \(270 - 180 = \$90\).

So, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as 7x and 13x, respectively, where x is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by 7x. Substituting the value of x, we get:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[42\]"

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's current salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92.
   - Therefore, the total salary is \( 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \).

The total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."

3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

Substitute \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. He also has a part-time job where he earns $10 an hour. To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to calculate the total hours he would work in a week and then multiply by his hourly wage.

First, calculate the total hours spent playing video games in a week:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, calculate the earnings from working those 14 hours:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

So, Jordan would earn \(\$140\) in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

Final answer: \(\$140\)"
"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step:

- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

First, we identify the non-food items and calculate their total cost before tax:
\[ \text{Light bulbs} + \text{Cups} + \text{Roach traps} = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% tax to the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the food items:
\[ \text{Milk} + \text{Eggs} = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the costs of the food and non-food items:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Number of Clients:**
   - Kim already has 3 clients.
   - He is talking to 5 potential clients.
   - Therefore, the total number of clients will be:
     \[
     3 + 5 = 8
     \]

2. **Expenses per Client:**
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - The cost for each client is:
     \[
     2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9
     \]

3. **Total Expenses:**

"Brittany and her mom go to the museum. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, how much money, in dollars, did she give the cashier?

To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we first calculate the total cost of the tickets. The cost for 1 child ticket is $10, and the cost for 1 adult ticket is $12. Therefore, the total cost for both tickets is:
\[ 10 + 12 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Given that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation for Dorothy's friends as follows:

Let \(D\) be the number of friends Dorothy has. Then, we have:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came to inflate both tires, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came to inflate all their tricycle tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came to inflate their unicycle tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

4. **Total Tires Inflated**: Adding up all the tires inflated:
   \[
   10 \text{ bicycle tires} + 9 \text{ tricycle tires} + 1 \text{ unicycle tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
   \]

5. **Cost per Tire**: Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost in cents is:
   \[
   20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the total number of fries in the pack be \( x \).
2. Dave ate 14 fries, so \( x - 14 \) fries remained.
3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries, so \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries remained.
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries were eaten by the pigeons, leaving \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries.
5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third of the remaining fries. So, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \) fries remained.
6. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

First, let's calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest.

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( \$20 \)
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

2. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

3. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the compound interest formula:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

6. **Multiply the original price by the result:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and then subtract this from her budget.

The items and their costs are:
- Computer: â‚¬1090
- Screen: â‚¬157
- Keyboard: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so not added again)
- Mouse: (assumed to be included in the computer price, so not added again)
- Scanner: â‚¬157
- CD burner: â‚¬74
- Printer: â‚¬102

First, we add up the costs of the items:
\[ 1090 + 157 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1580 \]

Elvira's budget is â‚¬1500. Since the total cost of the items is â‚¬1580, which exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by â‚¬80.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Since Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits, we need to find out how many babysitting sessions are required to get 45 eggs. We do this by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the current age of Brooke as \( B \) and the current age of Seth as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation, we get:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"The ages of the birds are as follows:
- Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
- Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
- Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
- Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Adding these ages together, we get:
\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"Gustavo here! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total minimum monthly payment Jessica has to make on all her debts:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Adding these up, we get:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. So, we calculate 50% of $1000:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to the minimum payment:

"Given Zaid's monthly salary of $6000, let's break down his expenses and donations step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Amount given to daughter and wife**:

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver, we start by finding the number of white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is five times the number of white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( W \).

From the information given:
\[ 5W = 200 \]
Solving for \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, we know that Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of red roses as \( R \). Therefore:
\[ R = 4W \]
Substituting the value of \( W \):
\[ R = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, Fred must deliver \(\boxed{160}\) red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business."
"Given that Jan is 30 years old, we can determine the ages of Jean and Mark based on the information provided.

First, let's find out how old Mark was two years ago. According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Jan's age two years ago was \(30 - 2 = 28\).

Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).

So, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old.

Since this was two years ago, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

We are also given that Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two different events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

     20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the rides:**
   - Each ride costs $33.
   - They went on 2 rides.
   - Therefore, the total cost of the rides is:
     \[
     33 \times 2 = 66
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent is:

"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we start by calculating the total weekly need for the flock. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly need is:

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly need into a daily need by dividing the total weekly amount by the number of days in a week:

\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:

4. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
   \[
   80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g}
   \]

5. Adding the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples gives the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
   \[
   1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g}
   \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \(\boxed{2600}\) grams."
"On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. On Tuesday, she bought three times that number, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes. Adding these together, the total number of cakes she bought over the three days is \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To find the cost of each cup, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each half dozen plate costs $6000.
   - Therefore, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - The total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

The total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:**
   - Jacket: $30
   - Shoes (2 pairs): $20 each, so $20 * 2 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. **Calculate the money Sara earns from babysitting:**
   - She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so $5 * 4 = $20

3. **Determine the total amount of money Sara has before mowing the lawn:**
   - Sara already has $10 saved
   - Total from babysitting: $20
   - Total saved: $10 + $20 = $30

4. **Calculate how much more money Sara needs:**
   - Total cost of items: $70
   - Total saved: $30
   - Additional money needed: $70 - $30 = $40

5. **Determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn the additional $40:**
   - She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn
   - Number of times she needs to mow the lawn: $40 / $4 = 10

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

**Answer: 10**"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

2. According to the problem, each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. So, the equation for the total number of eggs is:
   \[
   3r + 5w = 42
   \]

3. The problem also states that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so:
   \[
   w = r + 2
   \]

4. Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8r + 10 = 42
   \]

6. Solve for \( r \):
   \[
   8r = 32
   \]
   \[
   r = 4
   \]

So, the number of red chickens is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers. The total number of customers by the third day was 500. Therefore, the number of customers she counted on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, let's calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we use the formula for the average:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251.

First, calculate Yuri's points:
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

Next, calculate Brianna's points:
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[ \text{Naomi's points} = 68 \]
\[ \text{Yuri's points} = 44 \]
\[ \text{Brianna's points} = 85 \]

The total points scored by the four students is 251. Therefore, we can find Jojo's points by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's points} = 54 \]

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

First, let's find out how many pieces Kalinda can place per minute:
\[ \text{Kalinda's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we calculate her mom's rate. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda:
\[ \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we add their rates to find the combined rate at which they can place pieces:
\[ \text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
2. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \(32 - 4 = 28\).
3. According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.
4. Let \(F\) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Therefore, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \(2F\).
5. We can set up the equation: \(28 = 2 \times 2F\).
6. Simplifying the equation: \(28 = 4F\).
7. Solving for \(F\): \(F = \frac{28}{4} = 7\).

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours each day.
   - Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

2. **Weekly Cost Calculation:**
   - The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   - Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

3. **Total Cost for 5 Weeks:**
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - Total cost before discount = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

4. **Applying the 10% Discount:**
   - The makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
   - Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Therefore, Jean paid \(\boxed{27000}\)."

"The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. First, we calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

"In 10 years, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages will be 30.

**Answer:** 30"
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace gives:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:
\[ 17 \div \frac{1}{4} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \]

Therefore, the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36
   \]
   So, there are 36 stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

2. Subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
   \[
   76 - 36 = 40
   \]
   So, there are 40 stars in the 5-star rows.

3. Determine the number of 5-star rows by dividing the number of 5-star stars by 5:
   \[
   \frac{40}{5} = 8

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:

"Gustavo here! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total working time:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
   - She takes a 30-minute break, so her actual working time is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Convert the working time to minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours to minutes:
     \[
     2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals:**
   - Each 10-minute interval earns her $5. To find the number of intervals in 150 minutes:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are:
     \[
     15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 5 \times 0.2 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{kg per meal} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:

"Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. 

Let's calculate the total number of crates sold:
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week. The final answer is \(\boxed{55}\)."

"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]

"Gustavo here. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \) marbles.

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of marbles Solomon has:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kgs/marble} = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[ \boxed{156} \]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool and then multiply it by the cost per cubic foot.

1. Calculate the volume of the pool:
   The pool dimensions are 6 feet by 4 feet by 5 feet. The volume \( V \) is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

2. Calculate the cost to fill the pool:
   The cost to fill the pool is the volume of the pool multiplied by the cost per cubic foot. The cost per cubic foot is $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that the classroom has 30 boys, we can determine the number of girls and nongendered children as follows:

1. The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can calculate the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

"Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate. Job B pays $42,000 a year and is in a state that charges $6,000 in property tax and a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax.

First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A:
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate (Job B) compared to the other job (Job A).

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students. Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we have:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

"To solve the problem, let's start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so we can write:
\[ H = 2C \]

We also know that the total number of animals is 60, so:
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know the number of cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we need to calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]

"Annabelle is saving for a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 in her savings. Her first job, where she earns $10 per hour, pays her for 20 hours of work. She is also paid for 15 hours of work at her second job, where she earns $5 an hour. 

First, calculate her earnings from the first job:
\[ 10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate her earnings from the second job:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 15 \text{ hours} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, add her initial savings and the earnings from both jobs:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} + 75 \text{ dollars} = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, determine how much more she needs to save to buy the phone:
\[ 400 \text{ dollars} - 355 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Annabelle still needs to save is \(\boxed{45}\) dollars."
"The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:

   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

"The train travels between three cities. The distances are as follows:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

The total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the total interest for the five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}

- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

Adding these together gives us the total number of gifts:

\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to use for bows on these 12 gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the number of gifts:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we need to find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

First, we determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we find the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Tim decides to cancel his $60 cable subscription and switch to streaming services. He subscribes to Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount when bundling them together.

First, calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount:
- The combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the discount is $10 + $10 = $20.
- With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced to 80% of $20, which is $20 \times 0.80 = $16.

Now, add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- The total monthly cost for the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Finally, subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the original cable subscription cost to find the savings:
- The savings are $60 (cable subscription) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Gustavo here!

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Writing a Song**: Carol spends 4 hours.
2. **Recording**: Half the time spent writing, which is \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours.
3. **Editing**: 90 minutes, which is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total work time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find what percentage of the total work time was spent editing. The time spent editing is 1.5 hours, and the total work time is 7.5 hours. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in the shelving system. The system has 6 rows and 6 columns, so the total number of slots is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of slots. Therefore, we calculate double the number of slots and then add 20:

\[ 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"

"Sally went to the seashore and her parents gave her $10 to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- For the first pound, she pays $3.
- For the second pound, she gets 1/2 off, so she pays $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- Total cost for taffy: $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- Seashells cost $1.50.
- Magnets cost 4 * $0.25 = $1.00.
- Total cost for seashells and magnets: $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all items:
- Total cost: $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:

"Gustavo here!

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks for $400.
2. He buys another package worth twice that amount, so the second package costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. He gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. He also buys a finale firework for $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

So, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
- The total number of heads is 180.
- The total number of humps is 304.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve these equations. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, we substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which totals to:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we get:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 that were left, we get:

"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months at $14 a month:**

"The problem states that Cole bought both tattered jeans and jogger jeans on sale. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less, which means the jogger jeans cost $22. Cole saved a total of $6, with 1/3 of the savings coming from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

First, calculate the savings from the jogger jeans:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
So, Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans. This means the original price of the jogger jeans was:
\[ 22 + 2 = 24 \]

Next, since Cole saved $4 on the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans was:
\[ 28 - 4 = 24 \]

However, the problem asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans. Since the original price of the jogger jeans is $24 and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28, the difference is:
\[ 28 - 24 = 4 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

Next, calculate the cost of the cake:
\[ \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, add up the costs of the soup, the bagel, and the cake to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He sells 2/3 of \( x \), which is 100 cards.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**

"The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs each. This means 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs, totaling 36 hotdogs. The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, totaling 18 hotdogs. Therefore, the caterer prepared a total of 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. The 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each got their two hotdogs, consuming 36 hotdogs. The remaining 22 guests each wanted 1 hotdog, needing 22 more hotdogs. This totals 58 hotdogs needed, but only 54 were prepared.

Thus, the number of hotdogs short is \(58 - 54 = 4\). Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:

"Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. First, we calculate half of Indras' name:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we add 4 to this result to find the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how much gasoline is in each container. We start with 15 gallons of gas, which are equally divided into 5 containers. So, we divide 15 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
   \]

2. Josey needs \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container to run her lawnmower. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 3 gallons:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. Now, we need to convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He had 1% of his money left, which is $0.05.
3. Therefore, he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.

Next, we know the cost of the chips and candy bars:
- Each bag of chips costs $0.40.
- Each candy bar costs $0.75.
- George bought 3 bags of chips, so the total cost for the chips is $0.40 \times 3 = $1.20.

Now, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent:
$4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75.

To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the remaining amount by the cost of one candy bar:
$3.75 \div $0.75 = 5.

So, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so he shared \(25 - 5 = 20\) lollipops with his four friends. Since the lollipops were shared equally, each friend received \(20 \div 4 = 5\) lollipops.

2. Calculate the cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the cost of the beef stock.
4. Find the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's start with the onions:
- The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and Antoine doubles that amount.
- Therefore, he needs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.
- The cost of onions is $2.00 per pound.
- So, the cost of the onions is \(4 \times 2 = \$8.00\).

Next, the beef stock:
- He needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
- Each box costs $2.00.
- So, the cost of the beef stock is \(2 \times 2 = \$4.00\).

Now, the total cost of the ingredients:
- The total cost is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(8 + 4 = \$12.00\).

Finally, the cost per serving:
- The soup serves 6 people.
- So, the cost per serving is \(\frac{12}{6} = \$2.00\).

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Given that the area of the room is 360 square feet, we can use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the room using the perimeter formula for a rectangle:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of soil for one raised bed.**
The dimensions of one raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil for 10 raised beds.**
Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume \( V_{\text{total}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.**
Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags \( N \) required is:
\[ N = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.**
Each bag costs $12. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define:
- \( D \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) is:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"Brianne and Ashley are making Greek orange pie. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, which totals to:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Together, they have:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is:
\[ \frac{120}{3} = 40 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.
4. The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.

We can write the equation for the total number of insects as:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Mariah and her grandma were knitting and used yarn from a skein that contains 364 yards. Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the skein, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the skein. To find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we calculate the amount each used and then add them together.

Mariah used:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. She bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so $1.

The total cost of all the gum is $7. We need to find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \).

The total cost equation can be written as:
\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"Frederick is making popsicle sticks from wood to save money. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood, with a 2 x 4 costing $4 and a 2 x 8 costing $6.

To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should buy the cheaper option, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, 6 pieces will provide:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total cost for the snowshoes, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Mario has 6 dogs.

Therefore, Janet would save \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the weekly bus pass."
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows. Additionally, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

**Final Answer:**
120"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
2. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we divide the number of onions Rose bought by 4:
\[ \text{Number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Similarly, to find out how many potatoes Sophia bought, we divide the number of potatoes Rose bought by 4:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to get the total:
\[ \text{Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought} = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

So, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit required:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.
   - Each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit.
   - Therefore, the total calorie deficit needed is:
     \[
     30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of days available:**
   - Andy's goal is to lose the weight by July 19th.
   - Today is December 31st.
   - Counting the days from December 31st to July 19th:
     - December: 31 days (from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days).
     - January: 31 days.
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year).
     - March: 31 days.
     - April: 30 days.
     - May: 31 days.
     - June: 30 days.
     - July 1st to July 19th: 19 days.
   - Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 190 days.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   - Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
     \[

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can write these as equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

First, calculate Ada's current weekly electric consumption:
- Daily consumption: 12 kWh per hour * 24 hours = 288 kWh
- Weekly consumption: 288 kWh/day * 7 days = 2016 kWh

Next, calculate the cost of her current weekly electric bill:
- Cost: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024

Now, calculate the new daily and weekly consumption after adding the new device:
- New daily consumption: 288 kWh + 2 kWh * 24 hours = 288 kWh + 48 kWh = 336 kWh
- New weekly consumption: 336 kWh/day * 7 days = 2352 kWh

Calculate the new weekly electric bill:
- New cost: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to determine how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's find the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take 10 days for one person to paint a whole house. This means the rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we convert days into hours:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, we need to calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have.

First, let's determine the number of chairs Ophelia has. Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, and she has 20 sofas, the number of chairs she has is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is:
\[ 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Now, we need to find out how many sofas Jenna has. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is:
\[ 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together. The total number of sofas is:
\[ 20 + 64 = 84 \]

The total number of chairs is:
\[ 22 + 66 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[ 84 + 88 = 172 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"Gustavo here!

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set, spending a total of $48. To find the cost of the headphone set, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount paid:

\[ \text{Cost of headphone set} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

If Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 more to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:

\[ \text{Number of additional CDs} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's determine the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we can calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

So, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."

3. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. **Find Jame's Cousin's Current Age:**
   - Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Calculate the Age Difference:**
   - The age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer cost $1,100.

First, calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600 \]

Finally, determine the cost of one monitor:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."

"The thickness of the first book is 31 mm, the second book is 50 mm, the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is 50 - 5 = 45 mm, and the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is 2 * 31 = 62 mm. Adding these together, we get:

31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To find out how many vlogs Emma should make in the fourth week to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to complete her goal."
"To determine how much you end up paying, let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - Original bill: $50
   - Tip: 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10
   - Total bill including tip: $50 + $10 = $60

2. **Determine how the bill is split:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays: $60 / 2 = $30

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

"Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in each half of April:
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. Define the daily savings for the first half:
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. Define the daily savings for the second half:
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. Calculate the total savings for the first half:
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. Calculate the total savings for the second half:
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. Equate the total monthly savings to the target:
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

9. Determine the daily savings for the second half:
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"Verna bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each. Let's calculate the total cost of each type of fruit:

- Apples: \(3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50\)
- Oranges: \(5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00\)
- Peaches: \(6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50\)

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To find out how much Daniel has to spend, let's break down the costs first:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage by which Maggie's oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( T \). The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."

"Gustavo here! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total hours worked by Jill and John.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday
Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both John and Jill. They are paid $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30
John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill.

Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings
Difference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill.

The final answer is: $40"
"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories she burns from her activities.

"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

"Sure, let's break down the earnings step by step.

First, calculate the earnings from the first four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, calculate the earnings from the next two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Finally, add the earnings from both periods to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is \boxed{42}."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to find the cost per pump in cents.

First, determine the number of washings per pump:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, calculate the cost per washing:
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Then, find the cost for 60 washings (which is the cost per pump):
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Finally, convert the cost per pump to cents:
\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by calculating the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, reversing the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

We know that:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

Given:
- The total number of animal heads is 20.
- The total number of animal legs is 70.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ \begin{cases} 
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

"Erin has $6.00 to spend on ice cream. The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, determine how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

"Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, calculate the total amount of candy Ginger eats in two weeks:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Ginger eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Next, calculate the total amount of candy Amy eats in two weeks:
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- There are 14 days in two weeks.
- Therefore, Amy eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy in two weeks.

Now, determine how much candy each has left after two weeks:
- Ginger starts with 100 pieces and eats 56 pieces, so she has \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces left.
- Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 42 pieces, so she has \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces left.

Finally, find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
- Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces.
- Therefore, Amy has \(58 - 44 = 14\) more pieces of candy than Ginger.

The final answer is:

"James decides to pick some blueberries. It costs $20 to go picking and then an additional $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. How much did he save compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound?

First, calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries:
- Initial cost to go picking: $20
- Cost per pound: $1.5
- Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound Ã— Pounds picked)
\[
\text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
\]

Next, calculate the total cost of buying the blueberries at the store:
- Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
- Pounds of blueberries: 30

Total cost at the store = Cost per pound Ã— Pounds picked
\[
\text{Total cost at the store} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
\]

Finally, calculate the savings:
- Total cost of picking: $65
- Total cost at the store: $75

Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking
\[
\text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
\]

James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars compared to buying at the store."

"To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the daily savings:**
   - The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each.
   - The new vendor sells them for $0.4 each.
   - The difference in price per tomato is $0.5 - $0.4 = $0.1.
   - The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
   - Therefore, the daily savings are $0.1 * 500 = $50.

2. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The weekly savings are $50 * 7 = $350.

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and knowing that Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles each person has as follows:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of students per group when 54 students are divided into 6 equal groups:
\[ \frac{54}{6} = 9 \]
So, each of the 6 groups has 9 students.

Next, we need to find out how many students are required for each of the 12 groups if the activity requires 12 groups. Since the total number of students remains the same (54), we divide 54 by 12:
\[ \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]
This means each of the 12 groups would have 4.5 students.

To find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from the original 6 groups, we subtract the number of existing groups from the required number of groups:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem as follows:

1. **Weekdays Calculation:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Weekend Calculation:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total Chairs in One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total Chairs in Two 4-Week Months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is \(\boxed{4000}\)."

"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party. Converting dozens to individual items, we get:
- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the remaining items are:
- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

So, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

Final numerical answer:
86 glasses and 42 plates"
"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which means she trades \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which means she trades \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons from these large stickers.

Adding up all the buttons, she has 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

Therefore, the final answer is 107 buttons."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the problem step by step:

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles as well (since it needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The total cost of four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. We need to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, which cost the same amount.

First, we subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost:
\[ 64 - 30 = 34 \]

This means the remaining cost for the other two pizzas is $34. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide $34 by 2:
\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

So, each of the other two pizzas costs $17.

The final answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

**Final Answer:** 27"
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( O \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought, and \( W \) be the number of white fish Bob bought. Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the temperature during the night and then calculate how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.

1. The temperature during the day is 45 degrees.
2. The temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day, so the night temperature is:
   \[
   45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees}
   \]
3. The pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. Therefore, Carson needs to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, which is a difference of:
   \[
   32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees}
   \]
4. Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide 20 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. To find out how much money he spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway.

First, let's find the total distance \(D\) that the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be expressed as:
\[ D = 3 \times \text{speed of one kangaroo} \times 18 \]
Let the speed of one kangaroo be \(v\). Then:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"Erika is saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one is reduced by $200, making the new price $400. Erika has some savings in her purse, has been paid $150 for her part-time job, and her mom agrees to give her $80. She still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"

"To determine how much the farmer will earn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of trays needed to hold 900 eggs.
2. Determine the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray.

Each tray holds 30 eggs. Therefore, the number of trays required is:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

The price per tray is $2.5. Therefore, the total earnings are:
\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Mr. Smith initially has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which is 20 goats. 

After selling the goats:
- Farm X has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.
- Farm Y has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

Adding the goats left in both farms:
- Total goats left = \(45 + 25 = 70\).

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is 70."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   - Each basket of green food costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of green food is \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   - Each basket of red food costs $18.
   - You get $2 off for each basket of red food, so the cost per basket of red food is \( 18 - 2 = 16 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 3 baskets of red food is \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the green food and the red food.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 75 + 48 = 123 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{123}

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of Gustavo.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Gustavo is three years younger than his brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. Gustavo is two years older than his sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Their mom's age is one less than three times Gustavo's brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, Gustavo is \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. With 27 students and each needing 2 glue sticks, the total is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \]

Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs to ensure he has enough glue sticks.

"The initial amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons. After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles, so the new amount is:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons, so the new amount is:
\[ 8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:
\[ \boxed{14000} \]"
"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the infections day by day.

1. **Day 0**: Initially, 10 people are infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people from the end of the first day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people from the end of the second day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
   \[
   1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
   \]

2. Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
   \]

3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
   \[
   3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[
36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
\]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."
"Gustavo here!

Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves every hour. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, she bakes for 5 hours. So, the total number of loaves baked is:

\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:

\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is $0.50. Therefore, the total amount raised is:

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples.

"Let's denote the usual length of Elaina's concerts as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

"The singer has 50 microphones and realizes that 20% of them won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. First, we calculate how many microphones won't fit:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. This means the remaining microphones that can be paired are:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, the number of pairs is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.
2. He also counts \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that number of birds flying overhead. So, \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) birds are flying overhead.
3. He sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, \(3 \times 8 = 24\) birds are feeding.

Now, we add up all the birds:
\[6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
3. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
4. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
5. Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

Since Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54J \]

To find the value of \( J \), we need to ensure that the amount from lemonade sales is non-negative. The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J = 1 \):
\[ 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both the small and large masks:

The tank is then emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"Colby has a monthly budget of $150 to spend at the movies. By the end of the month, he has already spent:
- $50 on 5 movie tickets on Fridays or Saturdays (each ticket costs $10)
- $56 on 8 movie tickets on other days (each ticket costs $7)
- $16 on 2 tubs of popcorn (each tub costs $8)
- $8 on 4 boxes of candy (each box costs $2)

Adding these expenses together:
\[ 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 \]

Colby's remaining budget is:
\[ 150 - 130 = 20 \]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a movie ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[ 10 + 8 + 2 = 20 \]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"The total number of calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins can be calculated as follows:

1. Each mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, which is \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
2. Since Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

3. Each mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, which is \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
4. Since Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the total calories from both types of pastries, we get:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \]

Therefore, the total number of calories from the pastries is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

- **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
- **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
- **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, covering a distance of \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, covering a distance of \(30 \times 8 = 240\) miles. The difference in distance traveled is \(300 - 240 = 60\) miles.

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube, we need to add up the number of all the other toys and then subtract that total from the overall number of toys Sophie has.

Here are the numbers of each type of toy:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these numbers together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls there are, we subtract the total number of the other toys from the overall total:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:

"Let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) into \( P = Pa + J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P = 2J + 10 \) and \( Pa = J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons.

First, calculate the total number of balloons given by Maria initially:
- Maria gave 2 balloons to each of her 4 friends: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
- Maria had 1 balloon for herself: \(1\) balloon.

So, the total number of balloons given by Maria is:
\[8 + 1 = 9\]

Next, calculate the total number of balloons given by Maria's mom:
- Each of the 5 people (4 friends + Maria) received 3 more balloons: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, add the balloons given by Maria and her mom to find the total number of balloons:
\[9 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is:
\[
\boxed{24}

   - Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

2. Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney:
   - Sydney has 35 seeds and each seed is spat 12 feet.
   - Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

3. Calculate the average total distance spat:
   - The total distance spat by both is \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.
   - The average total distance spat is \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

The average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.
2. Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.
3. Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000.

**Final Answer:** $64,800"
"Gustavo here. Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cameron stays at the hotel from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which totals 17 hours.

1. The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
2. For the additional 5 hours, the cost is 70 pesos per hour.

So, the cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Adding the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional 5 hours:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would be 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the hay required for the sheep and goats separately.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"Gustavo here! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate John's Earnings:**
   John earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours.
   \[
   \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Subtract the Cost of Gas:**
   John spends $50 on gas.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Subtract the Deposit:**
   John wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Subtract the Cost of Pencils:**
   John buys 5 pencils, each costing $10.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   \[

2. Labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours. Since the charge is per hour or part thereof, we calculate \(35 \times 2.25 = 78.75\).
3. Parts charge: $60

Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

Therefore, the total charge for the job is $178.75."
"James buys 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = \$150 \]

He gets them for 40% off, so the discount amount is:
\[ 0.40 \times 150 = \$60 \]

The total cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 - 60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each, so the total amount he gets from selling them is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = \$200 \]

Since he was out $90 initially and he got $200 from selling 5 CDs, the net amount he was out is:
\[ 90 - 200 = -110 \]

Since the question asks how much money he was out, and he ended up with a positive amount, the correct answer is that he was not out any money but rather made a profit. However, the question specifically asks for the money he was out, so the answer is:
\[ \boxed{\$0} \]"

1. Calculate the commission from the New York Times.
2. Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal.
3. Sum the two amounts to get the total commission.

**Step 1: Calculate the commission from the New York Times.**

- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Each copy of the New York Times costs $5.
- He sells 6 copies.

The commission per copy of the New York Times is:
\[ 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} \]

The total commission from 6 copies is:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

"Given the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. If the book is 1.5 inches thick, we need to calculate the total number of pages.

First, determine the total number of pages in 1.5 inches of paper:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Gustavo here! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The total time is 15 hours.

Next, we convert the total time into minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. Additionally, she was awake from 2:38 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 3 hours and 17 minutes or 227 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept, we subtract the time she was awake and sleepwalking from her usual sleep duration:
\[ 480 - (227 + 23) = 480 - 250 = 230 \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{230}\)."

2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.
4. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is \( J + 2J + 4J = 7J \).
5. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \).
6. Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the total number of balls, we get \( 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \).

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"The pirate crew dug a total of 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day, but they filled in 2 holes. So, the net increase in holes by the end of the third day is calculated as follows:

- First day: 10 holes
- Second day: 13 holes
- Third day: 8 holes - 2 filled holes = 6 net increase

Total holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, so together they received:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, so Collins received:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"The total cost of supplies is $400. The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. 

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Then, add this amount to the cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

So, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three segments:

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net southward distance:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

Net distance:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen, which is 6 brownies. When she got home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her, which is 48 brownies. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Then, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ 48 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Adding these times together:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The price of each phone is $600. The first two phones are at full price, so the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:

"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Gustavo here! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away.
3. Subtracting the given boxes from the total, she has \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes left.
4. She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) boxes.
5. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes.
6. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is \(6 \times 20 = 120\).

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"The USA has 50 states. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \). Adding 4 to this gives \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states in India.

"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, let's start by calculating the total cost of the books:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work is:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Both cars cost a total of $160."
"Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be 5 years from now. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, meaning his dad will be 48 years old. Also, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

To find their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time required for each.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **SautÃ©ing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sautÃ© 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sautÃ© 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sautÃ© 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}

"Gustavo here. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break it down by each type of check:

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which totals:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The first plane makes a total of \( F \) flights in a day.
2. Three-quarters of these flights are to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

"Given the information:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the given information:
1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Walter is collecting money for charity. He collects $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from an online fund. His lawyer offers to donate three times the total amount collected from these sources. First, we calculate the total amount collected:

\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

The lawyer's contribution is three times this amount:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Walter's friend also donates $200, but this does not affect the lawyer's contribution. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. First, calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception. There are 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies:
   \[
   100 \times 15 = 1500 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:
   \[
   \frac{750}{15} = 50 \text{ people}
   \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We have a family of 6 people, consisting of 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

The total number of slices is:
- 2 adults each getting \(2x\), which totals \(2 \times 2x = 4x\)
- 4 kids each getting \(x\), which totals \(4 \times x = 4x\)

So, the total size of the watermelon is \(4x + 4x = 8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"Doctor Jones has 9 hours scheduled at the clinic on Monday. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds and has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. With 9 inpatients, the total time for rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 180 minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The total time for appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on rounds and appointments:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Subtracting this from the total 9 hours at the clinic:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to account for all the steps involved in making the cake.

1. Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
2. Cooling the cake takes 2 hours (120 minutes).
3. Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.
4. Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.

Adding these times together:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (baking)} + 120 \text{ minutes (cooling)} + 20 \text{ minutes (making batter)} + 10 \text{ minutes (frosting)} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours. Therefore, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

"To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter.
2. Use the total number of chocolate bars sold to find the number of chocolate bars per box.

First, let's find the total number of boxes sold:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes.
- Together, they sold \(3.5 + 4.5 = 8\) boxes.

Next, we know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars together. Since they sold 8 boxes in total, we can find the number of chocolate bars per box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost per Session:**
   - Studio rental: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total cost per session for students: \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars
   - Total cost per session: \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars

2. **Cost per Day:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Total cost per day: \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars

3. **Cost per Week:**
   - Number of weeks in a month: 4
   - Total cost per week: \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, let's start by setting up the equations based on the information given:

- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, if \( p \) is the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes, we have:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
  Solving for \( p \):
  \[
  p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
  \]

- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, if \( m \) is the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes, we have:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]
  Solving for \( m \):
  \[
  m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
  \]

Now, we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"The population of porcupines in the park is 50. The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, which means there are \(30\) female porcupines. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of baby porcupines born each month is \(30 \times 4 = 120\). Over the course of a year, the number of baby porcupines born is \(120 \times 12 = 1440\). Adding these to the initial population, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is \(50 + 1440 = 1490\).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks, so there are \(9 + 5 = 14\) blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so there are \(14 - 3 = 11\) yellow sticks.

Now, let's add them up:
\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

So, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time = 55 miles/hour Ã— 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed Ã— Time = 45 miles/hour Ã— 10 hours = 450 miles

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo:
- Difference = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."
"Brook Hills High School currently enrolls 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students over 16 years old. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 375 male students over 16 years old. This leaves 1125 female students over 16 years old.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which means there are 1500 students under 16 years old. One-half of the students under 16 are male, so there are 750 male students under 16 years old. This leaves 750 female students under 16 years old.

Adding the female students over and under 16 years old, we get a total of 1875 female students.

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at this school is \(\boxed{1875}\)."

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey runs \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn runs \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn runs \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"The tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons. Wanda and Ms. B decided to fill it in two days. On the first day, Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity, and Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda. On the second day, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day, and Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.

First, calculate the amount of water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

Total water pumped on the first day:
\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

Total water pumped on the second day:
\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

Total water pumped over the two days:
\[ 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

The remaining capacity of the tank:
\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the remaining capacity of the tank is \(\boxed{6000}\) gallons."
"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

1. After 8 hours, the power bank has 28% charge remaining.
2. For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
   \[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]
3. For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
   \[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]
4. We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
   \[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]
5. Calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
   \[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
   \[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]
6. Substitute these values into the equation:
   \[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
   \[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
7. Solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

   - With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - Over 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

The final answer is:
\[

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to find the price per sandwich for each package. Given that the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich should be the same for all packages.

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the price per sandwich is consistent, it is $1.50. Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow can be calculated by considering the scenarios where he does not get an extension. 

1. Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework: 50% or 0.50
2. Probability of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension: 40% or 0.40
3. Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension: 
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension: 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability: 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Summing these probabilities gives the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:
\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs, we first calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. 

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's deliveries. One-fifth of 425 is 85, so on Tuesday they delivered \(85 + 17 = 102\) letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as they did on Tuesday. Twice 102 is 204, so on Wednesday they delivered \(204 + 5 = 209\) letters.

Adding up the deliveries from Monday to Wednesday, we get:
- Monday: 425 letters
- Tuesday: 102 letters
- Wednesday: 209 letters

Total deliveries: \(425 + 102 + 209 = 736\)

"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles needed.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
\[ 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt} \]

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all the cats in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{2}\) days."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Becky ate 10 slices.
2. Jake ate 3 fewer slices than Becky, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Now, let's sum up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Adding the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:

"Mr. Hezekiah initially dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. This means the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours into the delivery, it was reported that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. Therefore, the number of trucks with mechanical failures is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This leaves:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

These 15 trucks successfully delivered their load. Thus, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00

"To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who couldn't come to find the actual number of guests attending.
3. Calculate the cost based on the theater rental fee and the additional guests.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:
- Classmates: 25
- Dance class girls: 7
- Family members: 13

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we subtract the 4 guests who couldn't come:
Actual guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests, and $6 for each additional guest. The number of additional guests is:
41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 * $6 = $126

Adding the base fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

"Maggie and Riza each have $60 left after spending some of their money. Let's calculate how much money they originally had and how much they spent.

For Maggie:
- She spent a quarter of her money, so she has three-quarters left.
- If three-quarters of her money is $60, then her original amount \( M \) can be calculated as:
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
- Therefore, Maggie originally had $80 and now has $60 left.

For Riza:
- She spent one-third of her money, so she has two-thirds left.
- If two-thirds of her money is $60, then her original amount \( R \) can be calculated as:
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
- Therefore, Riza originally had $90 and now has $60 left.

Adding the amounts of money they have left:

So, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Bananas and Daily Consumption:**
   - Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which are enough to feed his three monkeys for a week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.

2. **First Monkey's Consumption:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
   - In a week, the first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas.

3. **Second Monkey's Consumption:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.
   - In a week, the second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas.

4. **Third Monkey's Consumption:**
   - Let the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day be \(x\).
   - In a week, the third monkey eats \(7x\) bananas.

5. **Total Bananas Equation:**
   - The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys in a week is the sum of the bananas eaten by each monkey.
   - Therefore, \(70 + 98 + 7x = 315\).

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Combine the known values: \(168 + 7x = 315\).
   - Subtract 168 from both sides: \(7x = 147\).
   - Divide both sides by 7: \(x = 21\).

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

"Gustavo here! Let's solve this step by step.

First, we need to find out how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. So, the total number of toothpicks she has saved is:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of toothpicks she already has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing the number of toothpicks she needs by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."

1. The original price of the watch is $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
4. To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the price the friend paid, and then find what percentage this difference is of the original price.
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%

"Gustavo here! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches. Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas, so:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually. Each banana costs $0.80, so:

\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, let's calculate the cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, so:

\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:

\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is:

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

Since each bag is sold for $5, the total earnings are:
\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"The initial amount of meat on the triceratops can be determined by working backwards from the information given.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left.
2. Before the velociraptors scavenged, the remaining meat was twice the amount left after the Allosaurus ate, so it was \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms.
3. Before the T-Rex ate, the remaining meat was twice the amount left after the velociraptors scavenged, so it was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls.

- The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the area for these two walls is \(2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the area for these two walls is \(2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train, which is \(60 \div 2 = 30\) miles per hour.

Now, we calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train: \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\)

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:

\[180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\]

So, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.

"To determine how many people Billy helps, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:**
   - March has 31 days.
   - From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
   - From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
   - Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

2. **Determine the number of days Billy works:**
   - Billy takes 20% of the days off.

"The problem states that there were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church. Each bus carried 35 people, and each car carried 3 people. We need to find out how many people were inside the church, but the problem does not provide the exact number of people in each vehicle that attended the ceremony. Therefore, we can only calculate the maximum possible number of people that could have been transported by the vehicles.

First, calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:
\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]

Next, calculate the total number of people that the cars could carry:
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:
\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Since the problem does not specify how many of these people actually attended the ceremony, the final numerical answer based on the given information is:

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce 400 toys in total and still needs another 20 toys to complete the order. This means the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so if Arnold painted \(A\) eggs, Madeline also painted \(A\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. If Sarah painted \(S\) eggs, then Camden painted \(S + 12\) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

From the information given:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \(S = 9\) back into \(A + S = 22\):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted \(S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.

The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of groups of crayons:**
   Nik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   \[
   \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   Each box weighs 8 ounces and Nik needs 25 boxes.
   \[
   \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons and the boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[

7. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk = 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"Gustavo here!

Jane has been saving $4 every week for the past 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Her goal is to save a total of $60. So, the amount she still needs to save is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks needed to save the remaining $28 is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we need to calculate how many face masks he uses every 2 days.

1. First, determine the number of face masks used per outing: 2 masks.
2. Next, calculate the number of face masks used per day: \(2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).
3. Finally, calculate the number of face masks used in 2 days: \(6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.
2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.
3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs to find out how many are still hidden:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:**
   - The first two complexes have 200 apartments each.
   - Combined, they have \(200 + 200 = 400\) apartments.
   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes.
   - Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is \(400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640\) apartments.

2. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - Total apartments = \(200 + 200 + 640 = 1040\) apartments.

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment.
   - Total collections per week = \(1040 \times 3 = 3120\) collections.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money made in a week:**
   - He gets paid $0.40 per collection.
   - Total money made in a week = \(3120 \times 0.40 = 1248\).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{1248}\)."
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break down the production year by year:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:
\[
\boxed{1650}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

1. Sophia has $100.
2. She gives Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100.
3. \( \frac{1}{5} \) of $100 is \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \).

So, Sophia gives Jack $20. 

4. Jack originally had $100.
5. After receiving $20 from Sophia, Jack now has \( 100 + 20 = 120 \).

Therefore, the final amount Jack has is $120.

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From \( B = Y - 7 \), we get:
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - After giving an equal amount \(x\) to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"To find the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday, we can calculate the number of puffs for each day and then sum them up.

- **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
- **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Monday, so \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.
- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - 20% of 100 pods is \(0.20 \times 100 = 20\) pods.
   - Therefore, the special size box contains \(100 + 20 = 120\) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The cost per pod is \(\frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}\).

3. **Determine how many cycles can be run for $1:**
   - Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, and each pod costs $0.10, for $1, you can buy \(\frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ pods}\).
   - Therefore, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.

   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20

"In the first half of the soccer match, Team A scores 4 goals while Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals. Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

The total goals scored by Team A in the match is \(4 + 2 = 6\), and the total goals scored by Team B in the match is \(2 + 8 = 10\).

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. This means he has 5 - (5 * 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches left.

Each day, he uses 20% of the remaining chalk. We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

- After the first day: 2.75 * 0.80 = 2.20 inches
- After the second day: 2.20 * 0.80 = 1.76 inches
- After the third day: 1.76 * 0.80 = 1.408 inches
- After the fourth day: 1.408 * 0.80 = 1.1264 inches
- After the fifth day: 1.1264 * 0.80 = 0.90112 inches

Since 0.90112 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The difference is \(109 - 78 = 31\), which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:

"Gustavo here!

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. This means each bottle of scotch costs:
\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which is 20 bottles. The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch, so:
\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac together, we get:
\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends on everything is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of fish with red stripes. Given that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we calculate the number of fish remaining after removing those with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

From the remaining 44 fish, \( \frac{5}{11} \) have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Adding the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes gives us the total:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes is:

42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

First, let's calculate the total miles that all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."

"In November, the toy was priced at $40. In December, the price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price:
\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

In January, the price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price:
\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."

"To determine what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.
2. Determine the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.

First, let's calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days. Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr. Assuming he travels for 24 hours a day, the distance he travels in one day is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr/day} = 1200 \text{ km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he travels is:
\[ 1200 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas (which is 6000 km) Michael has covered. The percentage is calculated as follows:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
5. The remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother ate and used their grapes were all used for the pies, so the total number of grapes initially must be the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies. This gives us \(36 + 48 = 84\) grapes.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine John's New Speaking Speed:**
   - John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).
   - After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.
   - New speaking speed = \( 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \).

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Words:**
   - Each page has 450 words.
   - John needs to speak 10 pages.
   - Total words = \( 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \).

3. **Calculate the Time Required:**
   - Time = Total words / Speaking speed.
   - Time = \( \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \).

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ kernels} \]

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which means Igor gathered \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which means Igor gathered \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Let the number of beakers Igor brought be \(x\). Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor lost \(7 - x\) beakers.
4. The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]
6. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers and Igor brought 5, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
   \[
   7 - 5 = 2

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes."

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The original cost of the radiator is $400.
2. Mark gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.
   \[
   \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80
   \]
3. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.
   \[
   \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150
   \]
4. Adding the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor gives us the total amount Mark paid.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230
   \]

So, the final amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. Set up the equations based on the given information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( c + k = 20 \)
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

3. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

4. Now we have the system of equations:
   - \( c + k = 20 \)
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

5. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   - \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \)
   - \( k = 15 \)

6. Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   - \( c + 15 = 20 \)
   - \( c = 5 \)

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
