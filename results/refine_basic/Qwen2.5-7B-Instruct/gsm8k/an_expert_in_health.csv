"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The increase in value is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\(\boxed{70000}\)"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. To find the total distance he runs in a week, we can calculate it as follows:

1. Distance run in one session: \(3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters}\)
2. Total distance run in a week: \(180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}\)

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens.
2. Determine the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

For each pair of glasses, the cost is:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the total cost by determining how many pairs of glasses there are:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times \$8 = \$64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into several steps:

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}\). On his return trip, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles. He then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}\). Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering \(80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\). The total distance covered on the return trip is \(0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \, \text{miles}\). Therefore, the distance remaining from home is \(180 \, \text{miles} - 135 \, \text{miles} = 45 \, \text{miles}\).

**Final Answer:** 45 miles."
"Eliza's earnings for the week can be calculated by breaking down her hours into regular and overtime hours and applying the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \). So, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). After this sale, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
6. Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
7. Add 6 to both sides:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance. This means 4 students (20% of 20) are in contemporary dance. The remaining students are:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \]

Of these 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. So, the number of students in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \]

The remaining students, who enrolled in hip-hop dance, are:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \]

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( S \) be the number of silver coins.
2. Let \( G \) be the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step to find out how many jewels Siobhan has.

1. First, we need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
2. Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Now, we know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}

   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on her skipping speed and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.
- Her running speed is four times her walking speed.

First, calculate Dana's running speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, calculate her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, determine the time spent running and walking:
- Total time: 6 hours
- Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}\)

Calculate the distance traveled while running:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Calculate the distance traveled while walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package.
2. Subtract the number of Post-it notes used at work from the total to find out how many were in the package.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \(80 + x\) Post-it notes, where \(x\) is the number of Post-it notes in the package. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[80 + x - 220\]

We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[80 + x - 220 = 23\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[80 + x - 220 = 23\]

"Given the scenario, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's break down the information provided:

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit and did not have to drive through the traffic jam.

To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we can set up the following equation:

"Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. 

To determine how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:
   \[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

2. Calculate the number of potted plants she will give away:
   \[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

3. Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants she already has:
   \[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

4. Add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery:
   \[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, let's break down the information given:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we can sum up all the doorbell rings:

\[
20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} = 175
\]

The total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"Solo has to read a total of 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook, and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. This sums up to:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

Given:
- The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles.
- The city is 42 miles across.

We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pieces**: The total number of jigsaw pieces is 1000.

2. **Pieces Placed by Poppy**: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   Therefore, 750 pieces are left.

4. **Pieces Placed by Poppy's Mom**: Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy's Mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   Therefore, 500 pieces are left to be placed.

The final number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\)."

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) gives us the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. Here's the breakdown of his TV watching time:

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, totaling 2 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday as \(x\). Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:

\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:

\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
8. Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine Sasha's profit from selling her leftover lumber, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.
2. Calculate the total selling price of the lumber after the price increase.
3. Determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total selling price.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the lumber.**

- For the 2x4x10 boards: 10 boards * $10 each = $100.
- For the 4x4x10 boards: 5 boards * $16 each = $80.
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

**Step 2: Calculate the total selling price of the lumber after the price increase.**

- The price of 2x4x10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = 10 boards * $15 each = $150.
- The price of 4x4x10 boards increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = 5 boards * $24 each = $120.
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

**Step 3: Determine the profit.**

- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \boxed{90}."

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the 20 available cars for rent, we first need to find out how many cars are semi-automatic.

Given:
- Total cars = 20
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

The number of semi-automatic cars is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and relationships given:

- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we know:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. There is a 10% tax on all non-food items. Let's break down the costs:

- Milk and eggs are food items, totaling $2 + $3 = $5.
- Light bulbs and cups are non-food items, totaling $3 + $3 = $6.
- Roach traps are also a non-food item, adding $4 to the non-food total.

The subtotal for non-food items is $6 + $4 = $10. With a 10% tax on these items, the tax amount is $10 * 0.10 = $1. Therefore, the total cost for non-food items after tax is $10 + $1 = $11.

Adding the cost of the food items, the total cost is $5 (food) + $11 (non-food with tax) = $16.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra will need:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs every time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let Brooke's current age be \( B \) and Seth's current age be \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her total minimum monthly payment for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the amount Jessica pays in a year is $18000."

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement by dividing the total weekly amount by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year. Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees planted is 10 trees/year * 10 years = 100 trees. The total number of trees chopped down is 2 trees/year * 10 years = 20 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years is 50 + 100 - 20 = 130 trees. After 10 years, 30% of these trees die, which is 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees. Thus, the number of trees left is 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

The final number of trees Tom has left is \boxed{91}."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

"Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After the first month, she collected three times that number, which is 3 * 20 = 60 cards. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months, which is 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = 200 cards. Adding all these together, the total number of cards Elaine has now is 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Mark is a copy-editor who edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers. Publisher B pays him twice as much per sentence as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and the total is 1000 sentences, he edits:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B}
   \]

2. **Calculate the payment from Publisher A:**
   Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the payment from Publisher B:**
   Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so Publisher B pays:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence}
   \]
   For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   Adding the earnings from both publishers gives:
   \[
   2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{7500}
\]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem:
- Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
- Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool.
   - Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

2. **Understand the Rate of Water Loss:**
   - Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

3. **Formulate the Equations:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.
   - According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
   - Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
     \[ B = 4S \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
     \[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting these 63 is:

"Steve decides to start eating more tomatoes and decides to grow his own cherry tomatoes. He eats twice as much as his girlfriend. He eats 6 per day. If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, how many vines does he need?

A) 10  
B) 12  
C) 14  
D) 21

First, let's determine the daily tomato consumption of Steve's girlfriend. Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Tomatoes eaten by girlfriend per day} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we find the total daily tomato consumption for both Steve and his girlfriend:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per day} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Now, we calculate the total weekly tomato consumption:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes per week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we determine the number of vines needed by dividing the total weekly consumption by the production per vine:

\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into three steps:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees, the time to heat to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. Each bid increases by $50, and she makes 4 bids in total, including the initial bid of $200.

1. The first bid is $200.
2. The second bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The third bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The fourth bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, we sum up all the bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

So, the total amount Carmen spends on the desk is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"To determine the annual cost John incurs for the driving service, we need to calculate both the cost based on miles driven and the annual bonus.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven annually is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
```
31800

"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. Adding these times together gives:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. Therefore, we multiply the total time from Monday and Sunday by 2:

\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Peter has to exercise for \(\boxed{78}\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal."
"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, produces 4 pages: 2 on the front and 2 on the back.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages produced per piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total Books in Collection**: 250 books
2. **Books Remaining Unsold**: 50 books
3. **Books Sold This Year**: 45 books
4. **Price per Book**: $20
5. **Books Sold in the First Year**: Twice the number sold this year, which is \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books

Next, we calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
\[ \text{Total Books Sold} = \text{Total Books in Collection} - \text{Books Remaining Unsold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Now, we find the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} = \text{Total Books Sold} - \text{Books Sold in the First Year} - \text{Books Sold This Year} \]
\[ \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money Earned in the Second Year} = \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} \times \text{Price per Book} \]
\[ \text{Money Earned in the Second Year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Martha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. This means she invited a total of \(2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\) people. 

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and \(\frac{1}{4}\) of those 8 people had previous commitments. So, the number of people with previous commitments is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\). Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

To find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Solomon initially bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
2. He added these to a store that already had 50 marbles.
3. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2 kilograms, so the total weight of the marbles is:
\[ 78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kgs/marble} = 156 \text{ kgs} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."

"To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, which includes 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. We can calculate the number of pencils in the boxes as follows:
\[ 26 - 2 = 24 \]
So, the 3 boxes contain 24 pencils. This means each box holds:
\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. Adding Jam's and Meg's pencils together, we get:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils} \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store all 72 pencils, given that each box can hold 8 pencils, we perform the following division:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

"To determine how much Shannon’s iced coffee is weakened, we need to consider both the effect of the ice cubes and the cream added.

1. **Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]
   Therefore, the weakening effect from the ice cubes is:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

2. **Effect of Cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

3. **Total Weakening:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

"Given the scenario, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the Number of Junior Programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   - Therefore, the number of junior programmers is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Senior Programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is:
     \[
     100 - 40 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the Monthly Payment for Junior Programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total monthly payment for junior programmers is:
     \[
     40 \times 2000 = 80000
     \]

4. **Calculate the Monthly Payment for Senior Programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid:
     \[
     2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total monthly payment for senior programmers is:
     \[
     60 \times 2400 = 144000
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Monthly Payment for All Programmers:**
   - The total monthly payment for all programmers is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
     \[
     80000 + 144000 = 224000
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"To determine how many people got on the bus at the terminal, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). The smallest group will then have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation gives:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two larger groups has 70 students. The smallest group, therefore, has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows: \( H = 2C \).
   - The total number of animals is 60: \( H + C = 60 \).

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the second equation: \( 2C + C = 60 \).
   - Simplify: \( 3C = 60 \).
   - Solve for \( C \): \( C = 20 \).
   - Find \( H \): \( H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

4. **Calculate Total Legs:**
   - Cows have 4 legs each, so the total number of legs from cows is \( 4C = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, so the total number of legs from chickens is \( 2H = 2 \times 40 = 80 \).
   - Total number of legs: \( 80 + 80 = 160 \).

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is \(\boxed{160}\)."

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one trip and then multiply it by the number of trips per day. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 125 miles from the third city back to the first city (since it travels 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs).

The total distance for one trip is:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the current points of Sara and Erin.
2. Determine Erin's points before the recent score.

Sara currently has 8 points. According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can calculate Erin's current points as follows:

\[ \text{Erin's current points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

This means that after scoring 14 points, Erin has 24 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring these 14 points, we subtract 14 from her current points:

\[ \text{Erin's points before} = \text{Erin's current points} - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Thus, Erin had \(\boxed{10}\) points before scoring 14 points."
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - An additional 20% cost for etching each frame is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Total cost per frame = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - Total cost for 44 seniors = 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - Total cost for pins = 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers = 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - Total cost for cords = 11 * $12 = $132.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of picture frames + Cost of pins + Cost of cords
   - Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty given the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\) stripes
   - Another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(\frac{36}{2} = 18\) stripes

   Adding these together: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\) stripes

2. Calculate the average number of stripes:
   - There are 4 zebras in total.
   - The average is \(\frac{88}{4} = 22\)

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the initial number of corns:**
   - We know that Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis.
   - He has 40 cannolis.
   - Therefore, the number of corns is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **Calculate the new number of cannolis after buying more:**
   - Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   - The new total number of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).

3. **Determine the new number of corns after buying more:**
   - Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought.
   - He bought 60 cannolis, so he bought \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns.
   - The new total number of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

4. **Calculate the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.

"Sally went to the seashore for vacation and was given $10 by her parents to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- The seashells cost $1.50.
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- The total cost is $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
- $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how much Tim spent in total on fireworks, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."

Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we need to consider the given probabilities and the total number of candles produced.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and will explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Apples Gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: \( x \) apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
   \[
   30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
   \]

2. **Apples Gathered by Joanne's Sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
   \[
   60 + 45 = 105
   \]

3. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   Subtract 150 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dromedaries in a herd consisting of camels and dromedaries, given the total number of heads and humps.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

   - Distance per day: 200 km
   - Total distance: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Distance is 30% of the first 4 days' total distance
   - Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next Day:**
   - No travel, so distance: \( 0 \text{ km} \)

4. **Second Week:**
   - Distance per day: 300 km
   - Total distance: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs and the other half getting one. This means 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, totaling 36 hotdogs, and the remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, totaling 18 hotdogs. Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 54.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. The 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each already got their second hotdog, so they are fine. The remaining 22 guests each wanted one more hotdog, totaling 22 additional hotdogs needed. Since only 54 hotdogs were prepared, the number of hotdogs short is \(54 - 58 = -4\) (which should be interpreted as 4 hotdogs short).

Thus, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The correct answer is:
\[

Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Therefore, the amount of gasoline she needed is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the amount of gasoline in pints is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, the number of pints of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount spent on chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.
   - Total cost for chips = \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying chips:**
   - George initially had $5.
   - Money left after buying chips = \(5 - 1.20 = 3.80\) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount of money left after all purchases:**
   - George had 1% of his initial money left.
   - 1% of $5 = \(0.05\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on candy bars:**
   - Total spent = Initial amount - Money left after all purchases.
   - Total spent = \(5 - 0.05 = 4.95\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - Amount spent on candy bars = Total spent - Amount spent on chips.
   - Amount spent on candy bars = \(4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75\) dollars.

6. **Determine the number of candy bars bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
   - Number of candy bars = \(\frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5\).

Therefore, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."

4. Add the costs of the onions and beef stock to get the total cost of ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's go through each step:

1. Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
   \[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

2. The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
   \[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

3. He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
   \[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

4. The total cost of the ingredients is:
   \[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
   \[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"When Marcus wakes up, his house is at 40 degrees. Over the next 3 hours, he bakes, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the temperature increase from baking is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]
Adding this to the initial temperature:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time James took for each segment of the triathlon and then determine the time for the run.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then multiply by the number of rooms.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, we sum the number of each type of laundry item per room:
\[2 \text{ (sheets)} + 1 \text{ (comforter)} + 4 \text{ (pillow cases)} + 8 \text{ (towels)} = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry per room}\]

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally cost-effective, we need to set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's define the number of insects David found as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while a 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. Since Frederick wants to maximize the number of sticks and the 2 x 4 wood is cheaper, he should buy as many 2 x 4 pieces as possible.

With $24, Frederick can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will provide:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total cost for the snowshoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs.
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the snowshoes is:

   - Original bill: $50
   - Tip: 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10
   - Total bill including tip: $50 + $10 = $60

2. **Determine the amount each person pays:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays: $60 / 2 = $30

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]"
"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly target, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total Days in April**: 30 days
2. **First Half of April**: 15 days
3. **Second Half of April**: 15 days

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Elvis's monthly savings target is $1125. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Since the daily savings in the second half is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April."
"To determine how much change Verna received, let's break down the costs step by step:

"To solve the problem where Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars with Jeff getting 4 times as much as Brad, we can set up an equation to find out how much each person gets.

Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight loss = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's sorted play set.
2. Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information given.

James's play set has 80 toys. Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"To determine how much Daniel has to spend on the items he wants to buy after a 10% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the amount Daniel has to spend is \(\boxed{27.00}\)."

"To determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes him to swim a mile in both conditions and then find the difference for 3 miles.

In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, for 3 miles, the time is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water. Twice the time in cold water is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding 2 minutes gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]
So, for 3 miles in warm water, the time is:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

The difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day is:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the durations of both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"

"To determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of one box of contacts.
2. Determine the total cost for 2 boxes.
3. Find the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.
4. Calculate the cost per contact.

First, the original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount. The discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

So, the price of one box after the discount is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts. Therefore, 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

To find the cost per contact, we divide the total cost by the total number of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{180} = 1.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{1.00} \]"
"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, let's break down the hours worked and calculate the earnings step by step.

First, calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, calculate the earnings for both:
- They are paid $10 per hour.
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories she burns during her workout. 

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Adding these together gives the total calories burned:
\[1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\]

Given that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs as follows:
\[\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800 \, \text{ml}}\) of water."
"To solve this problem, let's define the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

Given that the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, we can express the number of red jelly beans \( R \) as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so we can express the number of green jelly beans \( G \) as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To find the average of Jared's three typing speeds, we first need to determine all three speeds:

1. The initial typing speed is 47 WPM.
2. After the lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM.
3. If he increases his typing speed by 5 WPM once more, his new speed will be \(52 + 5 = 57\) WPM.

Now, we calculate the average of these three speeds:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

First, we sum the speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Next, we divide the sum by 3 to find the average:

\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is:

\[
\boxed{52}

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating mushrooms, we can break it down step-by-step:

1. **Protein Content per Gram of Mushrooms**: 
   - A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is \( \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \).

2. **Daily Protein Intake**:
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - The daily protein intake is \( 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \).

3. **Weekly Protein Intake**:
   - To find the weekly protein intake, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 (the number of days in a week).
   - Therefore, the weekly protein intake is \( 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \).

Thus, John gets \(\boxed{42}\) grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"To solve the problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:

"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle and another angle is three times the smallest angle, we can set up the following equation to find the measure of the angles:

Let the smallest angle be \(x\). Then the other two angles are \(2x\) and \(3x\). The sum of these angles is:

\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[6x = 180\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\]
\[3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\]

"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to convert all his coins into nickels and then see how many gumballs he can purchase.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equivalent to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equivalent to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equivalent to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equivalent to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels remain as 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equivalent to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equivalent to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels Colby has:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we can break down the calculation into two parts based on the different rates and durations of sales.

1. **First Four Hours:**
   - Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
   - Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
   - Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

2. **Next Two Hours:**
   - Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
   - Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
   - Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10 (and reverse the inequality):
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the daily customer processing rate for each individual.
2. Calculate the combined daily customer processing rate.
3. Multiply the combined daily rate by the number of days in a week to find the total weekly production.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Combined daily customer processing rate:
\[ 50 \text{ (Jewel)} + 100 \text{ (Julie)} = 150 \text{ customers/day} \]

Total weekly production:
\[ 150 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week} \]

Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:

"To determine how much more a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:

- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have the system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Christina records her mood every day on a calendar. Over the past thirty days, she had twelve good days, eight bad days, and the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her next eight days were bad, and her following eight days were neutral. If the next three days were good, neutral, and good, how many good days were left in the month?

Let's break it down:

1. Total days = 30
2. Good days = 12
3. Bad days = 8
4. Neutral days = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Specifically:
- First 8 days were good.
- Next 8 days were bad.
- Following 8 days were neutral.
- Next 3 days were good, neutral, and good, which means 2 more good days.

So, the total number of good days accounted for is:
- Initial good days (first 8 days) = 8
- Additional good days (next 3 days) = 2
- Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

Since the total number of good days recorded is 12, and we have already accounted for 10 good days, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 - 10 = 2

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
2"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has \(\boxed{9}\) books."
"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional height needed.
3. Determine the number of days required based on the daily growth rate.

First, convert the current height from feet to inches:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, calculate the additional height needed to reach 600 inches:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows 30 inches per day, we can find the number of days required by dividing the additional height by the daily growth rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then extend that to the total period.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years (120 months), Rong's total savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + 20 \text{ coins} \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years (120 months), Neil's total savings are:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together gives:

"John brings his dog to the vet. The dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, and a heartworm check, which is 60% of the total bill. We need to find out how much John leaves with after paying the total bill.

First, calculate the cost of the vaccines:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Let the total bill be \( x \) dollars. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
\[ \text{Heartworm check} = 0.6x \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ x = 40 + 0.6x \]

To find \( x \), solve the equation:
\[ x - 0.6x = 40 \]
\[ 0.4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of Martha's turtle given the speed of her cat and then calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in a given time.

1. **Determine the turtle's speed:**
   - The cat's speed is 15 feet/second.
   - The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.
   - Therefore, the turtle's speed is \( \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \).

2. **Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:**
   - The turtle's speed is 3 feet/second.
   - The time is 40 seconds.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \).

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.

**Final Answer:** 120 feet"
"To determine how many more hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal, we first calculate the remaining amount needed. The goal is $6300, and they have already raised $2100. Therefore, the remaining amount is:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we find the hourly fundraising rate. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so the hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

To find out how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours needed is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

"In a student council election with 100 voters, candidate A received 20% of the votes. This means:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 20 \]

Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

The remaining votes went to candidate C. Therefore, the number of votes for candidate C is:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, candidate C received 50 votes."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Apples:**
   - Boris has 100 apples.
   - Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has \(100 - 23 = 77\) apples.

2. **After Boris Gives Apples:**
   - Boris gives 10 apples to Beck.
   - Boris now has \(100 - 10 = 90\) apples.
   - Beck now has \(77 + 10 = 87\) apples.

3. **Difference in Apples:**
   - The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck is \(90 - 87 = 3\).

Therefore, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{3}\)"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making different sized ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Small cubes**: Each small cube uses 0.5 ounces of water. Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   \[
   8 \text{ small cubes} \times 0.5 \text{ ounces per cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Next, we add up the total amount of water used:
\[
12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount:
\[
32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( x \) be the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house. According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the first house, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
- The third house will need double the first house, which is \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine the terms on the left side:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The number of cases of shingles needed for the third house is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the exact number of cases, we use the exact fraction:
\[ 2x = \frac{1000}{7} \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{1000/7}\) cases of shingles."

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.

2. **Total Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought a total of 17 fish from the pet store.

3. **Final Fish Count:**
   - After adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( O \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( W \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. \( O + W = 17 \) (total fish bought)
2. \( 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \) (twice as many orange fish as white fish after the addition)

We can solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

From the first equation:
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute \( O \) in the second equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish:
\[ O = 17 - W = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

Verify the final fish count:
- Orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- White fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)

Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has. Bubbles currently has:

- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

Adding these together, the total number of stuffed animals is:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals, so we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kris is aiming to earn a video game achievement by playing a total of 30 hours. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks and then for 2 hours every day for a week. Let's calculate the total hours she has played.

First, calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:
- Half an hour each day for 14 days (2 weeks) is \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

Next, calculate the hours played in the following week:
- 2 hours each day for 7 days is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

Now, add the hours from both periods:
- Total hours played = \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. Therefore, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
- \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will cover:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will cover:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}

"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we need to account for the tea consumed and the tea remaining.

First, calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total tea consumed:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \text{ gallons} \]"

"Given the scenario where the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of January, we can calculate the number of students at the end of May as follows:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number of students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

2. Write the equation for the total amount of the salt scrub:
   \[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
   Divide the entire equation by 2:
   \[ z + 2s = 5 \]

3. Solve for \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
   \[ z = 5 - 2s \]

4. Since \( z \) and \( s \) must be positive and the total must be 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then:
   \[ z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \]
   This satisfies the equation.

5. The amount of oil is \( 2s \):
   \[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross a highway, given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to do so.

First, let's find the total distance \(D\) the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos, each traveling at speed \(v\), take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"Erika is saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one is reduced by $200, making the new laptop cost $400. Erika has some savings in her purse, has been paid $150 for her part-time job, and her mom agrees to give her $80. She still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many apple slices Adam has left, let's break down the problem step by step.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:

"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

   - There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is \(50 \times 10 = 500\).

2. Add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is \(500 + 20 = 520\).

3. Subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
   - The initial number of burritos ordered is 600.
   - The total number of burritos consumed is 520.
   - Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is \(600 - 520 = 80\).

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

\[75 - 52 = 23\]

So, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, let's break down the costs of each item she purchased:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for a total of $10. Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Thus, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Therefore, the total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is:

"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we start by calculating the number of indoor plants. Given that one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. We calculate the number of flowering plants as follows:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total earnings and the earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, so \( K = 3J \).
   - Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's, so \( A = 5J \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Earnings from Joe's lawn: \( 6J \)
   - Earnings from Kamala's lawn: \( 6K = 6(3J) = 18J \)
   - Earnings from Alba's lawn: \( 6A = 6(5J) = 30J \)
   - Total earnings from mowing lawns: \( 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \)

4. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - Total earnings from lemonade sales and mowing lawns: \( 54J + L = 80 \)
   - Where \( L \) is the amount earned from lemonade sales.

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - \( L = 80 - 54J \)

6. **Determine the value of \( J \):**
   - Since \( L \) must be a non-negative amount, \( J \) must be an integer.
   - Testing \( J = 1 \):
     - \( L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \)

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is \(\boxed{26}\)."

"Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. He and his wife, along with their two children, will be eating from this pot. Each person will have one bowl at the meal.

First, let's determine the total number of bowls needed for the family:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife)
- 2 child bowls (for the children)

This totals to 4 bowls. Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, it has enough soup for 4 adult bowls. After the family eats their 4 bowls, there is no leftover soup for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

"To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
   - For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
   - For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

3. **Total Material Needed:**
   - Adding the material for small and large masks: \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

Therefore, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the current ages:**
   - Duncan's current age is given as 60 years.

2. **Set up the relationship:**
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\) years.
   - Four years ago, Adam's age was \(A - 4\) years, where \(A\) is Adam's current age.
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as:
     \[
     52 = 2(A - 4)
     \]

3. **Solve for Adam's current age:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     52 = 2A - 8
     \]
   - Add 8 to both sides:
     \[
     60 = 2A
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     A = 30
     \]

4. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Adam's current age is 30 years.
   - In 8 years, Adam will be:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red balloons.
   - Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.
   - The number of red balloons is 20.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of pieces of bologna can be expressed as:
     \[
     2R + 3Y = 58
     \]
   - Substitute \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
     \[
     2(20) + 3Y = 58
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     40 + 3Y = 58
     \]

4. **Solve for \( Y \):**
   - Isolate \( 3Y \) by subtracting 40 from both sides:
     \[
     3Y = 58 - 40
     \]
     \[
     3Y = 18
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     Y = \frac{18}{3}

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   Summing the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}

   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance and combined their allowances to buy the items, the total amount of $28 was split equally between them. Therefore, each received:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = \(30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}\).

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5.
   - Total cost = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:**

"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

"Given the problem, we need to determine Peter's age based on the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean, which is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( Pa \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the information provided:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

Substituting the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Thus, Peter's age is:

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 60
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour: 45
  - Hours per day: 24
  - Days per month: 30
  - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Price per widget: $6
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Find the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much money Cameron would save, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total stay duration**: Cameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is 17 hours.
2. **Cost for the first 12 hours**: The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.
3. **Additional hours cost**: For the remaining 5 hours (17 hours - 12 hours), the hotel charges 70 pesos per hour. Therefore, the cost for the additional hours is:
   \[
   5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos}
   \]
4. **Total cost for Cameron's stay**: Adding the cost for the first 12 hours and the additional hours, we get:
   \[
   1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos}
   \]
5. **Cost for a 24-hour stay**: The hotel charges 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay.
6. **Savings**: The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
   \[
   1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{250}

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the hay requirement for each type of animal and then sum these amounts.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

He then deposits $100 in the bank, leaving him with:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

He buys 5 pencils at $10 each, spending:
\[ 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, he has:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

With the remaining $100, he can buy:
\[ \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored. Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know the total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45.
2. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo.
3. Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we can find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. To find the number of pages in the book, which is 1.5 inches thick, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we divide the total number of pages by 2:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he stapled from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, we first calculate the total time he spent stapling.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, at 5:55 a.m., and was observed sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. The time she was awake before getting out of bed is from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 3 hours and 40 minutes or 220 minutes.

To find out how many minutes she slept on her bed, we subtract the time she was awake and the time she was sleepwalking from her usual sleep duration:

\[ 480 \text{ minutes} - 220 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} = 237 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{237}\)."

"Given the information, we can determine the ages step by step.

1. Aliya's age is given as 3 years old.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna's age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so Shawna's father's age is:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"The problem presented involves determining the total number of basketballs brought to practice based on the number of balls each boy carried. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

"The problem presented involves calculating the number of holes dug by a pirate crew on the fourth day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[ 10 \text{ (first day)} + 13 \text{ (second day)} + 6 \text{ (net increase on third day)} = 29 \text{ holes} \]

By the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

To find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day, we subtract the number of holes at the end of the third day from the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
\[ 40 \text{ (end of fourth day)} - 29 \text{ (end of third day)} = 11 \text{ holes} \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, which means Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.
3. The total number of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins.

So, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the $400 he spends on supplies.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

"The bird's journey can be broken down into segments to determine the net distance between its northern and southern homes.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg:**

   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

To find the net distance, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

Net distance:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen (6) brownies. When she got home, her friends had 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting for her. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:

Therefore, the total time Andy will take to restring all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. Each phone after the first 2 is half price. The price of each phone is $600.

The cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, we add the number of players on both teams to find the total number of players:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need for his fence, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. This leaves her with 8 boxes. She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself, which is 2 boxes. Therefore, she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{120}\)"
"The United States of America has 50 states. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \). Adding 4 to this gives the number of states in India as \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, let's first calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25 is:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"Given the information:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

To find the current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes separately and then combine the times.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be done sequentially, the total time is the sum of the peeling and sautering times:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"Given the information, we need to determine Wilfred's age. Let's summarize the details:

- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of the four children is 20.
- Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.

First, we calculate the total age of Akbar and Alessandro:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Since the total age of all four children is 20, we can find the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, Helene's age is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, we know Helene is 10 years old. Using the combined age of Helene and Wilfred, we can find Wilfred's age:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Thus, Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."

"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is equivalent to \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Now, calculate \( 1400 \times 5.9 \):
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To determine the initial charge of Maria's power bank when she went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge. Let's denote the initial charge as \( x \).

After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs for his comforter, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, given that it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year starting from $20,000 in 2007, we can use the formula for depreciation:

\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20,000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption of cat food for all three cats.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so the daily consumption for one cat is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last \(\boxed{2}\) days."

   - Jake ate 3 fewer slices than Becky, so Jake ate:
     \[
     10 - 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
     \]
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Total Slices Eaten**: Adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( D \) be the time Donovan's part took in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"James receives 80 emails per day. Out of these, 20% do not require any response. To find the number of emails that do require a response, we first calculate 20% of 80:

\[ 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \]

This means 16 emails do not need a response. Therefore, the number of emails that do require a response is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

James responds to these 64 emails each day. Over a 5-day work week, the total number of emails he responds to is:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is:

"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Adding the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team gives us the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

   \[
   2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons: Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons: Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. Add the costs of mailing the small and big coupons to find the total cost of postage:

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}

"To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who could not come to find the actual number of guests attending.
3. Calculate the cost based on the theater rental fee and the additional guest fee.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:
- Classmates: 25
- Dance class girls: 7
- Family members: 13

Total guests invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

Next, we subtract the 4 guests who could not come:
Actual guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests, and $6 for each additional guest. The number of additional guests is:
41 - 20 = 21

The cost for the additional guests is:
21 × $6 = $126

Adding the base fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
$125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the initial amount of meat on the triceratops be \( x \) kilograms.
2. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
3. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
4. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"The initial setup involves 12 sodas, with 3 of them shaken. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, leaving 2 shaken and 8 unshaken sodas. Her brother then takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 1 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

To find the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda, we need to calculate the probability of selecting a shaken soda from the remaining 7 sodas (1 shaken and 6 unshaken).

The probability is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{1}{7} \]

Expressing this probability as a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{7} \times 100\% \approx 14.29\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:
\[ 14.29\% \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train: \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\)

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:

\[180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest slide:
- Length: 240 feet
- Speed: 80 feet/minute
- Time = Length / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is:
- Difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

"Given that Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles, and knowing that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, we can calculate the distance Micah ran as follows:

\[ \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Charge:**
   Sheila initially charged $85.00 on her credit card.

2. **Return of Item:**
   She returned an item that cost $15.00. This reduces her balance.
   \[
   85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00
   \]

3. **Frying Pan Purchase:**
   The frying pan was on sale for 20% off $20.00. First, calculate the discount:
   \[
   20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00
   \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Toys Needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys Still Needed**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys Already Produced**: \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Next, we need to determine the production rate of the first four workers:
- First two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- Next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

To find the hourly production rate of the fifth worker:
\[180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Thus, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to ensure that the mixture of water from both mugs is at least 40 degrees for Donny to be able to drink it.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees. Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

1. **First Sale:**
   - Abraham sold half of 80 square meters, which is 40 square meters.
   - The sale price for these 40 square meters is $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, 40 square meters remain.
   - He sold 1/4 of the remaining 40 square meters, which is 10 square meters.
   - The sale price for these 10 square meters is $30.

3. **Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, 30 square meters remain.
   - He sold these 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   - The sale price for these 30 square meters is \(30 \times 3 = 90\) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

"Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we need to calculate how many face masks he uses every 2 days.

First, let's determine the number of face masks used per outing:
- Tyrion uses 2 face masks per outing.

Next, we calculate the number of face masks used per day:
- Since he goes out 3 times a day, the number of face masks used per day is \(2 \text{ masks/outing} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}\).

Now, we calculate the number of face masks used in 2 days:
- Over 2 days, the number of face masks used is \(6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}\).

Therefore, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, let's break down the production year by year based on the given information:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we can express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now that we have \( Y \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Understand the condition after giving money:**
   - After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money.
   - Let the amount given to the little sister be \(x\).
   - Therefore, Rissa's remaining money is \(15 - x\).
   - According to the problem, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Calculate \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
     \]
   - Set up the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining money for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the remaining money for Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

- **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Tuesday, so \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.
- **Thursday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Wednesday, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.
- **Friday**: She sees double the number of puffs from Thursday, so \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs from each day:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counted from Monday to Friday is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - Additional pods = 20% of 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20 pods.
   - Total pods in the special size box = 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - Cost per pod = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod.

3. **Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1:**
   - Since each pod runs one dishwashing cycle, and each pod costs $0.10, you can run:

"In the first half of the soccer match, Team A scores 4 goals while Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals. Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
- Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday, leaving him with 55% of the chalk. This means he has \(5 \times 0.55 = 2.75\) inches of chalk left.

Each subsequent day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk. We need to determine how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk after each day:

- After the first day: \(2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20\) inches
- After the second day: \(2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76\) inches
- After the third day: \(1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches
- After the fourth day: \(1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches
- After the fifth day: \(1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches

Since 0.90112 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

"To solve the problem, let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of slices each friend eats:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Next, calculate the total number of slices for all 6 friends:
- Total cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Total pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, determine how many whole pizza pies are needed for each type of pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]

Finally, add the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies to find the total number of pizza pies:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}
\]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices they all ate is:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices they all ate is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(109 - 31 = 78 - 31 = 34\).

The number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to break down the expenses:

1. The cost of the color is a fixed amount of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is based on the length of hair cut off. May's hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, so 2 inches of hair were cut off. At $30 per inch, the cost for the haircut is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

"Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. Given that April has exactly 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of days Jen works in April as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5. Therefore, her daily earnings are:

\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]

For 24 days, her total earnings are:

\[ 24 \text{ days} \times 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

\[ 270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how much blood one shark has.
2. Multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten.

We know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, the amount of blood in one shark is:
\[ 40 \text{ gallons} \times 3 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by ten:
\[ 120 \text{ gallons} \times 10 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10 = $60.

2. **Cost of Cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 20 bottles of cognac.
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + 0.5 * $60 = $60 + $30 = $90.
   - Total cost for 20 bottles of cognac = 20 * $90 = $1800.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost for scotch = $600.
   - Total cost for cognac = $1800.
   - Total amount spent = $600 + $1800 = $2400.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \( x \).

The problem states that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40. This can be written as the equation:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

First, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of fish with red stripes. Given that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we calculate the number of fish remaining after removing those with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

From the remaining 44 fish, \( \frac{5}{11} \) have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes. Adding the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes gives:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes is:

42"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

Given:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

The miles needed for the first three dogs are:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

"To solve this problem, let's define the lengths of the pieces more clearly. Let the length of the shorter piece be \(x\) feet. Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, its length would be \(4x\) feet.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation:
\[x + 4x = 40\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[5x = 40\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 5:
\[x = \frac{40}{5} = 8\]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[4 \times 8 = 32\]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs to store her 110 books, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase.

Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so the middle shelves together can hold:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ books} \]

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books} \]

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books} \]

Adding the capacities of all the shelves in one bookcase, we get:
\[ 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

"To determine how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Plants needing half a cup of water:**
   - 4 plants × 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups

2. **Plants needing 1 cup of water:**
   - 8 plants × 1 cup/plant = 8 cups

3. **Plants needing a quarter of a cup of water:**
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants needing half a cup or 1 cup = 4 + 8 = 12 plants
   - Therefore, plants needing a quarter of a cup = 20 - 12 = 8 plants
   - 8 plants × 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups

Adding these amounts together:
- 2 cups (half a cup plants) + 8 cups (1 cup plants) + 2 cups (quarter cup plants) = 12 cups

Thus, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( c \) be the number of chickens.
- \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]
