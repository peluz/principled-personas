"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. He does this 3 times a week. So, the total distance he runs in one session is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) meters. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is \(180 \times 3 = 540\) meters.

The total meters James runs a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens.
2. Subtract the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily requirement.

Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so the total feed given in these two meals is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing pattern: the first glass costs $5, and the second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. This pattern repeats for every pair of glasses.

1. Cost of the first glass: $5
2. Cost of the second glass: $3
3. Total cost for one pair of glasses: $5 + $3 = $8

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the number of pairs as follows:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Sheep in Toulouse + Sheep in Charleston + Sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, we need to break down the process into several steps.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."

"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
5. Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
6. Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
7. Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
8. Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

"Kai here!

John sells 13 lego sets at $15 each, so he gets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 8 video games at $20 each and has $5 left, so the total spent on video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the video games and the leftover money from the total money he had:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week, with 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. Let's calculate his speed.

1. **Distance on the first day:**
   - He runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - Let his speed be \( v \) miles per hour.
   - Distance on the first day = \( 3v \) miles.

2. **Distance on the other two days:**
   - He runs half as much on the other two days.
   - Distance on each of the other two days = \( \frac{3v}{2} \) miles.

3. **Total distance in a week:**
   - Total distance = \( 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2} \).
   - Simplifying, we get: \( 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \) miles.

4. **Given total distance:**
   - Total distance = 60 miles.
   - So, \( 6v = 60 \).

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   - \( v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \) miles per hour.

Therefore, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
   - Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so:
     \[
     3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so:
     \[
     \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent running and walking:**
   - Total time: 6 hours.
   - Time spent running (one-third of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking (two-thirds of 6 hours):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance running:
     \[
     6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Total distance traveled:**
   \[
   12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her usual distance of 400 feet. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had initially and after her purchase.
2. Calculate the number of Post-it notes used at work.
3. Use the information about the remaining Post-it notes to find out how many were in the package.

Initially, Candice had 80 Post-it notes. After purchasing the package, she had \(80 + x\) Post-it notes. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes left after work is:
\[80 + x - 220\]

We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[80 + x - 220 = 23\]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[80 + x - 220 = 23\]
\[x - 140 = 23\]
\[x = 23 + 140\]
\[x = 163\]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \(\boxed{163}\)."

"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total money raised from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add the two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the money raised from selling brownies:
- Tommy sells each brownie slice for $3.
- He sells 43 brownies.

The total money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money raised from selling cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells each cheesecake slice for $4.
- He sells 23 slices of cheesecake.

The total money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
\[ 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest:
   \[
   5 \text{ cell phones} \times \$150 \text{ per cell phone} = \$750
   \]

2. Calculate the total interest for the 3-month installment. The interest rate is 2% per unit, and since there are five units, the total interest is:
   \[
   5 \times 2\% \times \$150 = 5 \times 0.02 \times 150 = \$15
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount Shiela will pay, which is the sum of the original cost and the interest:
   \[
   \$750 + \$15 = \$765
   \]

4. Since Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255
   \]

Therefore, the amount Shiela will pay each month for 3 months is:

"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we start by determining the square footage of each level. Given that the top level has a square footage of 16 and each subsequent level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:

1. **Top level (Level 1):** 16 square feet
2. **Level 2:** \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet
3. **Level 3:** \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet
4. **Level 4:** \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet

Next, we sum the square footage of all levels:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

To find the average square footage of a level, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[ \boxed{7.5} \]"
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and then find out how many bags this amount corresponds to.

1. Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \(180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}\).

2. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed for the first 180 days:
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
   - Number of bags needed = \(\frac{180 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = \frac{180}{110} = \frac{18}{11} \approx 1.636\).

Since Cecilia cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she will need 2 bags of dog food for the first 180 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"Given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we need to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

First, let's determine how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4D = 400 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 400 pounds, we have:
\[ \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying them in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus packages of 2 for $1.00 each.

First, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 3:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Total cost: \( 6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \)

Next, let's calculate the cost if Vincent buys the flowers in packages of 2:
- Number of packages needed: \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Total cost: \( 9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \)

The difference in cost, which represents the savings, is:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.
2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]
3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

"Given the scenario, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
2. After the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through, and let's denote this number as \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. Additionally, 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

The total number of cars that drive through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes, minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This can be expressed as:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, let's break down the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which is \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so he has \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left.
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):

- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Total for Beatrice = \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total for Marcell:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Total for Marcell = \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row:**
   - It takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - Therefore, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate of water intake:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - Multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
     \[
     \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photograph. Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can set up the equation:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. If 5 people came to inflate both tires, then the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. If 3 people came to inflate all their tricycle tires, then the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. If 1 person came to inflate their unicycle tire, then the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

4. **Total Tires Inflated**: Adding up all the tires inflated:
   \[
   10 \text{ bicycle tires} + 9 \text{ tricycle tires} + 1 \text{ unicycle tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
   \]

5. **Cost per Tire**: Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost in cents is:
   \[
   20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Convert to Dollars**: Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, the total amount in dollars is:
   \[
   500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
2. Each pack contains 6 cookies.
3. Each cookie costs $0.10.

First, calculate the total number of cookies:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the cookies:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

If Carl pays with a $10 bill, the change he receives is:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let the total number of fries in the pack be \( x \).
2. Dave ate 14 fries, so \( x - 14 \) fries remained.
3. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 7 fries, so \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \) fries remained.
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries were eaten by the pigeons, leaving \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \) fries.
5. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third of the fries. So, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \) fries remained.
6. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6
\]
\[
x - 30 = 18
\]
\[
x = 48
\]

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\boxed{272}
\]"
"To find the total length of all the baked goods put end to end, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and then sum them up.

1. **Rolls**: 
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls = \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: 
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants = \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes**: 
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches.
   - Total length of baguettes = \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we sum up the total lengths in inches:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}.\]

To convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}.\]

So, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."
"To determine the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly requirement for each type of ape and then double it for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys' requirement:**
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas' requirement:**
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons' requirement:**
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
   - For 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Next, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2-month period:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, let's break down the distances each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each back-and-forth trip is 200 yards (100 yards each way). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Each trip is 80 yards (40 yards each way). Therefore, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

The difference in the distances they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. The final answer is:

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

First, let's calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ starfish} + 6 \text{ sea horses} + 3 \text{ clownfish} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 \text{ starfish} + 3 \text{ sea horses} + 5 \text{ clownfish} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[ 19 + 13 = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest.

1. **Original Price and Rate of Increase:**
   - Original price: \$20
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

2. **Number of Two-Month Periods in 36 Months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

3. **Price Calculation:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the compound interest formula:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} = 20 \)
   - \( r = 0.20 \)
   - \( n = 18 \)

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

6. **Final Price:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Since Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many babysitting sessions are required to get 45 eggs. We do this by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45}{9} = 5 \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's define the variables first:
- Let \( B \) be Brooke's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Seth's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation: \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Now, find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hamsters:**
   - 10 cages, each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - Total straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.

3. **Rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw used for hamsters and rabbits = \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.
   - Straw for rats = \(160 - 70 = 90\) pieces.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = \(\frac{90}{6} = 15\).

4. **Rats in Cages:**
   - 15 rats are distributed equally among 3 cages.
   - Number of rats per cage = \(\frac{15}{3} = 5\).

- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is \(\boxed{106.12}\)."
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and the total revenue, and then use the profit to find the number of bags.

Let's denote the number of bags by \( x \).

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of buying the bags is \( 20x \) dollars.
   - The cost of transporting the bags is \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The revenue from selling the bags is \( 30x \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.
   - So, we have the equation: \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   \[

"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we start by calculating the total weekly need for the flock. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly need is:
\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly need into a daily need by dividing the total weekly amount by the number of days in a week:
\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, so the net increase is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial number of trees:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}

"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Since both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

First, substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, Yuri's points are:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's points are:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. The total points scored by the four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo's points can be calculated by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
   \[
   251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

So, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."

Therefore, it will take them \(\boxed{1}\) hour to complete the puzzle."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting these 63 is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. First, we calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:

"To find out how many cups of flour Carla will need, we first calculate the total number of cookies she is making over the two days:

\[ 36 \text{ cookies today} + 30 \text{ cookies tomorrow} = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we determine the amount of flour needed. Since 2 cups of flour are required for 12 cookies, we can set up the proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of flour Carla will need is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we start by calculating two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:

\[
6200 \div 100 = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is \(\boxed{62}\)."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Chris has 6 trees.
2. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
3. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of trees Harry has} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
   \]
4. To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8
   \]

So, the number of trees in Harry's yard that are more than in Ferdinand's yard is \(\boxed{8}\)."

   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. Calculate the total deductions:
   \[
   \text{Total deductions} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. Calculate the net proceeds:
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are:

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into three steps:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.
2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** This takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.
3. **Cooking the chicken:** This takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Adding these times together gives the total time:
\[ 20 + 28 + 23 = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."

2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add up the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

The total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]
4. The total number of stitches for the collar and rosette is:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]
5. The total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette is:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 270 = 1170
   \]
6. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800, so the number of stitches for the sleeves is:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]
7. Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

Therefore, the number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To determine how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for both the tomato seeds and the celery seeds.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:

"To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each part of his performance and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines

"In 10 years, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages will be 30.

**Answer:** 30"
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 5 \times 0.2 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{kg per meal} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"Sam has a target of selling 120 crates of bread in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only had 5 days to sell. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, and on Thursday 18 crates. 

Let's calculate the total number of crates sold:
- Weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Sam's target was 120 crates, so the difference is:
120 - 65 = 55 crates

Therefore, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week. The final answer is \(\boxed{55}\)."
"To determine how much the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount she bids. The bids increase by $50 each time, and she bids after each of the 3 other people, making it a total of 4 bids including her initial bid.

1. The opening bid is $200.
2. The first bid after the opening bid is $200 + $50 = $250.
3. The second bid is $250 + $50 = $300.
4. The third bid is $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, we sum up all the bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

So, the total amount Carmen spends on the desk is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"John hires a driving service to get him to work each day. His work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day. He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year. He gets charged $2 per mile driven and also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.

First, calculate the daily miles driven:
\[ 30 \text{ miles (to work)} + 30 \text{ miles (back home)} = 60 \text{ miles per day} \]

Next, calculate the weekly miles driven:
\[ 60 \text{ miles per day} \times 5 \text{ days per week} = 300 \text{ miles per week} \]

Then, calculate the annual miles driven:
\[ 300 \text{ miles per week} \times 50 \text{ weeks per year} = 15000 \text{ miles per year} \]

Now, calculate the cost for the miles driven annually:
\[ 15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars per mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the annual bonus:
\[ 150 \text{ dollars per month} \times 12 \text{ months per year} = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus to get the total annual cost:
\[ 30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
\[ \boxed{31800} \]"

"Let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

"Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Since the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( C \) be the number of cows and \( H \) be the number of chickens.
2. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, so \( H = 2C \).
3. The total number of animals is 60, so \( H + C = 60 \).

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:

"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours, while Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.

First, calculate the distance Cho hiked:

\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

**Final Answer:** 67 km"
"Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means she has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos, and 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which means she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's calculate the total number of silver and gold pesos they have together:

- Total silver pesos: \(50 + 100 = 150\)
- Total gold pesos: \(80 + 120 = 200\)

Adding these together gives the total number of pesos:

- Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\)

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Kai here!

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Lemonade Production**: Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So, the total number of cups of lemonade she can make is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Total Revenue**: She sells each cup for $1, so the total revenue from selling all 36 cups is:
   \[
   36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36
   \]

3. **Total Cost**: The cost of supplies is $18.

4. **Total Profit**: The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
   \[
   \$36 - \$18 = \$18
   \]

5. **Profit per Hour**: Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how long it takes to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Profit per Hour Calculation**: The profit per hour is the total profit divided by the total time:
   \[
   \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour}
   \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, which means he has \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left. We know that the remaining land is 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[

"The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. If the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we need to find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

Next, we determine the value of one part by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is:

"Tim decides to cancel his $60 cable subscription and switch to streaming services. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount when bundling them together.

First, calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% discount:
- The combined cost of Hulu and Disney Plus before the discount is $10 + $10 = $20.
- With a 20% discount, the cost is reduced by 20%, so he pays 80% of $20.
- $20 \times 0.80 = $16.

Now, add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- Netflix costs $10.
- The total cost for the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

Finally, subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the original cable subscription cost to find the savings:
- $60 (cable subscription) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to the streaming services. The final answer is:

"To determine the energy savings, we first calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when used for 8 hours a day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour, so for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the energy consumption if the usage is reduced by 5 hours a day, meaning the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting this to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is:

"Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we first calculate the total steps he had already taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

Since he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, the total steps he had taken before his jog plus the steps during his jog should equal 10,000 steps:
\[ 6,000 + \text{steps during jog} = 10,000 \]

Solving for the steps during his jog:
\[ \text{steps during jog} = 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 \]

However, we need to correct this as the problem states he had 2,000 steps left after his jog, meaning he had already taken 8,000 steps before his jog:
\[ 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \]

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."

"Sally went to the seashore and had $10 to spend. She bought taffy at a special sale where she could get 1 pound for $3 and the next pound at half price. She bought 2 pounds of taffy, so the cost for the first pound is $3 and the second pound is $1.50 (half of $3). The total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. The total cost for the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00. Adding the cost of the seashells, the total for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Adding the cost of the taffy, seashells, and magnets, the total amount spent is $4.50 + $2.50 = $7.00. Since Sally started with $10, the amount of money she has left is $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. He gets a 20% discount on the total, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

So, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many dozens of cookies that total is.

Shannon eats 2 cookies a night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many of the 50,000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode. The problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 1% of the candles will explode.

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, since the problem does not specify the exact overlap between the two defects, we assume the defects are independent. Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 1\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 0.01 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount price of one blouse.
2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price.

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. She gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.
3. Each camel has 2 humps.
4. Each dromedary has 1 hump.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (since each animal has one head)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (since camels have 2 humps and dromedaries have 1 hump)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can solve these equations. First, we'll subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, we substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
Solving for \( d \):
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the trip step by step:

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 km
   - Total distance: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Distance: 30% of the first 4 days' total
   - Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next Day:**
   - Distance: 0 km (no travel)

4. **Second Week:**
   - Distance per day: 300 km
   - Total distance: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given the relationships between the lockers, we can determine the size of Timothy's locker step by step.

1. Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, Zack's locker is:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, Timothy's locker is:

   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we first determine the elevation of the comb. Stanley was at 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, so the comb is at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

Therefore, the answer is 3,000 feet."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bank gave him $4000.
2. The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is \(2 \times 4000 = 8000\) dollars.
3. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which totals to:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we get:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 that were left, we get:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"Kai here.

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**

"The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hotdogs for 36 guests, with half of them getting two hotdogs each. This means 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs, totaling 36 hotdogs. The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, totaling 18 hotdogs. Therefore, the caterer prepared a total of 54 hotdogs.

However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. The 18 guests who were supposed to have two hotdogs each already got their two hotdogs, consuming 36 hotdogs. The remaining 22 guests each wanted 1 additional hotdog, needing 22 more hotdogs. This totals 58 hotdogs needed, but only 54 were prepared, resulting in a shortage of 4 hotdogs.

Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining how much gasoline is in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, we calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed. She required \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we convert gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the amount of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6 \text{ pints}} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

"The area of Billie's rectangular bedroom is 360 square feet. Given that the length of the room is 3 yards, we first convert the length to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

Using the area formula for a rectangle, \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \), we can find the width. Substituting the known values, we get:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
Solving for the width, we find:
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

"Kai here.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon.

- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the super ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for the super ticket option: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of the regular ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option.
   - We can set up the equation: $21 - ($15 + \( P \)) = $2

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   21 - 15 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   6 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 6 - 2
   \]
   \[
   P = 4
   \]

The regular price of the popcorn is $4.

**Final Answer:**
The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the initial cost per balloon. Given that 20 balloons cost $900, the cost per balloon is:

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for all the raised beds. Each raised bed has dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"

\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money."
"Kai here!

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
2. Jaime has 2 trays, so the total capacity is \(24 \times 2 = 48\) eggs.
3. Jaime has 64 eggs in total.
4. The number of eggs that won't fit is \(64 - 48 = 16\).

So, the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the tray is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Sally buys one small pizza at $8 and one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. The cost of the family-size pizza is:

\[ 8 + 24 = 32 \]

So, Sally spends a total of $32."
"Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. With the ""buy one get one free"" sale, if she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so the final cost for 2 packs is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00. Since each pack contains 4 razors, 2 packs contain 8 razors. Therefore, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25, which is 25 cents.

The final answer is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."
"The height of the human pyramid is determined by the height of the shortest cheerleader, who is 60 inches tall. Converting 60 inches to feet:

\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"Let's denote Angela's current age as \( A \).

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett is currently 14, three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela's current age is 38.**"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the total cost for both his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Now, we add the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the overall expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{112}

"Brianne and Ashley are making Greek orange pie. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box, so she brought a total of \(5 \times 10 = 50\) oranges. Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges. Together, they have \(50 + 70 = 120\) oranges. Since one Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges, the number of pies they can make is \(\frac{120}{3} = 40\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equal in cost, we can set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found.
2. Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
3. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.
4. The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43.

We can set up the equation based on the total number of insects:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Mariah and her grandma were knitting and used some yarn from a skein. Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein, and her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein. Since a skein contains 364 yards of yarn, we can calculate the amount each used and then add them together.

First, calculate the amount Mariah used:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, calculate the amount her grandma used:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Now, add the two amounts to find the total:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is:
\[
\boxed{273}

"Given that the chair is 3 feet wide and the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, the width of the rug is:
\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs $1.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Where \( x \) is the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, he should buy the cheapest lumber, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood. Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, and it costs $4.

Given Frederick has $24 to spend, he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Since each piece of 2 x 4 wood provides 200 sticks, 6 pieces will provide:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make if he buys the cheapest lumber is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find out how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. So, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the snowshoes is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which means the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows. Additionally, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

"Sophia and Rose went to the market to buy onions and potatoes. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we need to find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought in total.

First, let's determine how many onions Sophia bought. Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (\text{number of onions Sophia bought}) = 12 \]
Solving for the number of onions Sophia bought:
\[ \text{number of onions Sophia bought} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \]

Next, let's determine how many potatoes Sophia bought. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times the number of potatoes that Sophia bought, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (\text{number of potatoes Sophia bought}) = 4 \]
Solving for the number of potatoes Sophia bought:
\[ \text{number of potatoes Sophia bought} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

Now, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought to find the total:
\[ 3 \text{ onions} + 1 \text{ potato} = 4 \text{ items} \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calorie deficit required:**
   - Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.
   - Each pound requires a 3500 calorie deficit.
   - Therefore, the total calorie deficit needed is:
     \[
     30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of days available:**
   - Andy's goal is to lose the weight by July 19th.
   - Today is December 31st.
   - Counting the days from December 31st to July 19th:
     - December: 31 days (from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days)
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

Given:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can write these as equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, find \( H \):
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

"Before adding the new device, Ada's daily consumption is 12 kWh, which over a week amounts to \(12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week}\). At a rate of $1.50 per kWh, her weekly bill is \(2016 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024\).

After adding the new device, which consumes 2 kWh per day, her daily consumption becomes \(12 \, \text{kWh/day} + 2 \, \text{kWh/day} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day}\). Over a week, this is \(14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2352 \, \text{kWh/week}\). Her new weekly bill is \(2352 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3528\).

The difference between her weekly bills before and after adding the new device is \(\$3528 - \$3024 = \$504\).

"If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we need to determine how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

First, let's find out how long it takes one person to paint a whole house. Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, it would take:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 = 10 \text{ days} \]
for one person to paint a whole house.

Now, if 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ 5 \times \left(\frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}}\right) = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Converting 2 days into hours:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Ophelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has \(20 + 2 = 22\) chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which means Jenna has \(3 \times 22 = 66\) chairs. Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has \(66 - 2 = 64\) sofas. 

The total number of sofas is \(20 + 64 = 84\), and the total number of chairs is \(22 + 66 = 88\). Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, let's determine the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks.

He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, and for 6 hours for 1 week. So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Now, we can calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.

1. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, so the number of passengers left is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]

2. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

3. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]

4. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]

5. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

6. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66

The number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Determine Jame's current age:
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. Calculate Jame's age in 8 years:
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. Determine Jame's cousin's age in 8 years:
   - In 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. Calculate Jame's cousin's current age:
   - Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. Find the current age difference between Jame and his cousin:
   - The age difference is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of days in each half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings for the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings for the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of birds seen over the week.
2. Divide the total by the number of days (7) to find the average.

Let's start with the total number of birds:

- Days one and two: 50 birds
- Day three: 0 birds
- Days four and five: 120 birds
- Day six: 20 birds
- Day seven: 90 birds

Total number of birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

Now, we divide the total by the number of days:

Average number of birds per day = \(\frac{280}{7} = 40\)

So, the average number of birds Mack saw per day is 40.

"To determine the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to find the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( T \). The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch the two movies, we need to convert the total time into minutes.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the total time for both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"

"Given the problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ R = 0.99B \]

The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ G = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now, we can find \( R \) and \( G \):
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

   - Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

So, the total money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[
     \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}} = 6 \text{ years}

"The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to find the cost per pump in cents.

First, determine the number of washings per pump:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, calculate the cost per washing:
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Then, find the cost for 60 washings (which is the cost per pump):
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Finally, convert the cost per pump to cents:
\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by calculating the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

Given:
- Total cost for Karate classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, reversing the inequality:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the mowing rates:**
   - In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes. So, his mowing rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
   - In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. So, his mowing rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

2. **Calculate the time to mow half the lawn in each mode:**
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, let's calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:
\[1300 + 1150 = 2450\]

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which means she trades \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which means she trades \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers. Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she gets 20 large buttons.

She has \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons from these large stickers.

Adding up all the buttons, she has 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

Therefore, the final answer is 107 buttons."

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the requirements step by step:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, summing up all the shirts:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"Let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles.
- The third house will need \( 2x \) cases of shingles as well (since it needs double the first house).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = 50 \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( O \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought, and \( W \) be the number of white fish Bob bought. Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had \( 3 + O \) orange fish and \( 4 + W \) white fish. According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( O \) and \( W \), we get:

\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:

\[ O + W = 17 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( O - 2W = 5 \)
2. \( O + W = 17 \)

We can solve this system by elimination or substitution. Let's use the substitution method. From the second equation, we can express \( O \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute this expression for \( O \) into the first equation:

\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]

\[ -3W = -12 \]

Divide both sides by -3:

\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the equation \( O = 17 - W \):

\[ O = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[ 3 + 13 = 16 \]
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Since \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

"Sure, let's break down Jamie's earnings for Tuesday.

First, calculate her regular pay for 8 hours at $20 per hour:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$160 \]

Jamie worked 11 hours in total, so she worked 3 additional hours beyond her regular 8-hour shift. The special hourly rate for these additional hours is 150% of her regular rate:
\[ 150\% \times \$20 = 1.5 \times \$20 = \$30/\text{hour} \]

Now, calculate the pay for the 3 additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$90 \]

Finally, add the regular pay and the additional pay to find the total amount Jamie was paid:
\[ \$160 + \$90 = \$250 \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on Tuesday."

"Billy's starting hourly wage was $10 per hour. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50 per hour, making his new wage $10.50 per hour. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00 per hour, bringing his wage to $11.50 per hour.

Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's starting wage, which is $10.50 per hour. Therefore, Sally's starting wage is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00 per hour.

Billy works 20 hours, so his earnings are:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.50 \text{ per hour} = \$230 \]

Sally also works 20 hours, so her earnings are:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times \$11.00 \text{ per hour} = \$220 \]

The difference in their earnings is:
\[ \$230 - \$220 = \$20 \]

Therefore, Billy earns \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of all her stuffed animals, we start by calculating the current total number of stuffed animals she has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John goes to the market and buys 3 goats for $500 each and 2 cows for $1500 each. To find out how much money he spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost and the refund amount, then find the net loss.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
     \[
     \text{Cost per pound} = 4 \times 0.35 = \$1.40
     \]
   - The book needs to be returned 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.
     \[
     \text{Cost per mile} = 20 \times 0.08 = \$1.60
     \]
   - Total shipping cost:
     \[
     \text{Total shipping cost} = 1.40 + 1.60 = \$3.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The book cost $32, and Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
     \[
     \text{Refund amount} = 32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The original cost of the book is $32.
   - The refund amount is $24.
   - The shipping cost is $3.
     \[
     \text{Net loss} = 32 - 24 + 3 = \$11

"Boris owns a chocolate factory and produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. Here's the breakdown of his production for the first three weeks:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Now, let's calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since the total monthly production is 50,000 bars, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is \(\boxed{14,000}\)."

"Mason is traveling at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He travels for 4 hours and then for another 6 hours. To find the total distance he has traveled, we calculate the distance for each part of his journey and then add them together.

For the first part:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

For the second part:
- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours
- Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway.

First, let's find the total distance \(D\) that the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos, each traveling at speed \(v\), take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). The total speed of the four turtles combined is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is given by:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of the four turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"Erika is saving for a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one is reduced by $200, making the new price $400. Erika has some savings, has been paid $150 for her part-time job, and her mom agrees to give her $80. She still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Let's denote the amount of money Erika has in her purse as \( x \). The total amount of money Erika has is:
\[ x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \]

Since she needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount she has is:
\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 230 = 350 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 350 - 230 \]
\[ x = 120 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of slices from the large apples:
   - Adam has 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.
   - So, \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices from the large apples.

2. Calculate the total number of slices from the small apples:
   - Adam has 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.
   - So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices from the small apples.

3. Calculate the total number of slices:
   - Total slices = slices from large apples + slices from small apples.
   - Total slices = \(15 + 15 = 30\).

4. Calculate the number of slices left after Adam eats 15 slices:
   - Slices left = total slices - slices eaten.
   - Slices left = \(30 - 15 = 15\).

So, the number of apple slices left is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The farmer currently gets 5 liters of milk per day from one cow. With 3 cows, he gets:

\[ 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} \times 3 \, \text{cows} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

He wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[

"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. To find out how much more money he needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\$5600\)."

"To find out how many students are good at math, let's break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

First, we need to find out how many students are good at both math and English. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

So, the number of students who are good at math is:

"Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. To find out how much she will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The annual interest is:
\[ \text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the interest is simple, it accumulates linearly over time. For 3 years, the total interest is:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 225 \times 3 = 675 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to the original investment:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 = 975 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of Kai.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Kai is three years younger than his brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. Kai is two years older than his sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Their mom's age is one less than three times their brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all their ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, Kai is \(\boxed{13}\) years old."
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks required. With 27 students and each needing 2 glue sticks, the total is:

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the infections day by day.

1. **Day 0**: Initially, 10 people are infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people from the end of the first day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people from the end of the second day infects 6 others. So, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."

1. Claire earns 1 badge every month. In a year (12 months), Claire earns:
   \[
   1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
   \]

2. Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge, so she earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
   \[
   \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges}
   \]

3. Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame. In a year, Wendy earns:
   \[
   3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges}
   \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year:
\[
36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges}
\]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1 year time frame."

"Let's define the number of books each person has:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."

"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the thingamabob first. 

Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second. Then, the speed of the whatchamacallit is \( 11v \). Since the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we have:
\[ 11v = 121 \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, the speed of the whirligig is five times the speed of the thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.
2. Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
3. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3J \) times.
4. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5J \) times.
5. Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

The total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

Since Tasha made a total of $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54J \]

To find the value of \( J \), we need to ensure that the amount from lemonade sales is non-negative. The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J = 1 \):
\[ 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:

Calvin is making soup for his family. The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls. Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have 2 children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

First, let's calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 4 bowls

The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, which means it has enough soup for 4 adult bowls. After the family eats their 4 bowls, there is no leftover soup for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Adding these together, the total amount William spent is:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8.00} \]"
"To find out how much material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the material needed for the small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material needed is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

Next, let's calculate the material needed for the large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material needed is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both the small and large masks:
- Total material needed = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

So, the total amount of material Jo needs is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."
"To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets to find the average price per ticket.

First, we calculate the total number of tickets:
- There are 9 movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.
- Therefore, the total number of tickets is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Next, we calculate the average price per ticket:
- Deepa spent $216 in total.
- The total number of tickets is 27.
- Therefore, the average price per ticket is \(\frac{216}{27} = 8\).

The average price she paid per ticket is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( D \) be Duncan's current age and \( A \) be Adam's current age.
2. We know Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
3. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( 60 - 8 = 52 \).
4. Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
5. According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]
6. Solving for \( A \):
   \[
   52 = 2A - 8
   \]
   \[
   52 + 8 = 2A
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2A
   \]
   \[
   A = 30
   \]
7. Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   30 + 8 = 38
   \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}

Colby works in the packaging division and gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, he completes 40 packages per hour. In an eight-hour workday, he completes \(40 \times 8 = 320\) packages. Since he earns $0.20 per package, his earnings for the day are \(320 \times 0.20 = 64\) dollars.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long. To find out how many bottles of water he drinks while solving an extreme sudoku, we first calculate the time it takes to solve the extreme sudoku:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine how many bottles of water he drinks in 180 minutes. Since he drinks a bottle every 30 minutes:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Benny throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon.
2. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
3. There are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \).

The equation based on the given information is:
\[ 2 \times 20 + 3 \times Y = 58 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Subtract 40 from both sides:
\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final answer is:

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Jon drives 100 miles a day, so in 30 days, he drives:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. The cake cost $11, the balloons cost $3 (since 1 dozen balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, making 12 balloons cost $3), and the ice cream cost $14 (2 tubs at $7 each). Adding these up, the total cost is:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]
Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance and combined it to make the purchase, each of them must have received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]
Therefore, the amount each of them received from their mother is \(\boxed{14}\)."

"Kai here!

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:

"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

- **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
- **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
- **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

"Given the problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) into \( P = Pa + J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substitute \( P = 2J + 10 \) and \( Pa = J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by mom: 15

So, the total number of balloons is:

"After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Adding the number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother gives us the total number of letters:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find the total number of children in the drill, we need to calculate the number of children from each school and then sum them up.

1. Each row has 8 children.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. Therefore, the number of children in one school is \(8 \times 7 = 56\).
4. There are 5 different schools, so the total number of children is \(56 \times 5 = 280\).

Thus, the total number of children in the drill is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"The teacher has 9 coupons, each redeemable for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles from the coupons is:
\[ 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

There are 29 students, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Subtracting the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher has:
\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[ \boxed{842} \]"
"The total charge for the job can be calculated by adding the visit charge, the labor charge, and the parts charge.

1. Visit charge: $40
2. Labor charge: $35 per hour for 2.25 hours, which is \(35 \times 2.25 = 78.75\)
3. Parts charge: $60

Total charge = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

Therefore, the total charge for the job is $178.75."
"James buys 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = \$150 \]

He gets them for 40% off, so the discount amount is:
\[ 0.40 \times 150 = \$60 \]

The total cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 - 60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each, so the total amount he gets from selling them is:
\[ 5 \times 40 = \$200 \]

Since he only spent $90 and sold the CDs for $200, the net amount he was out is:
\[ 90 - 200 = -110 \]

However, the question asks how much money he was out, which in this context means the initial expenditure. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{\$90} \]"

"Given that Deanna is 26 years old, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Given the problem, let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these into the first equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( B = 25 \) back into the expressions for \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

So, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"The book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side. If the book is 1.5 inches thick, we need to calculate the total number of pages.

First, determine the total number of pages in 1.5 inches of paper:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"Kai here!

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports:**
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.

2. **Convert the total time into minutes:**
   - \(15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes:**
   - \(900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals}\).

4. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled:**
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   - \(60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}\).

So, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours or 480 minutes. On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes. The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes, or 220 minutes. Therefore, the total time she was awake that night is 220 + 23 = 243 minutes. 

To find out how many minutes she slept, we subtract the time she was awake from her usual sleep duration: 480 - 243 = 237 minutes.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{237}\)."

"If Courtney reported 48 people at the concert and Kelly said that number was 20% higher than the actual number, we can set up the equation to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number (since 100% + 20% = 120%).

This can be written as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( J \) be the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.
4. The total number of balls carried by the three boys is \( J + 2J + 4J = 7J \).
5. We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 1 \).
6. Substituting \( J = 1 \) into the total number of balls, we get \( 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \).

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"The pirate crew dug a total of 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day, but they filled in 2 holes. So, the net increase in holes on the third day is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes. 

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

At the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

The number of holes dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"Let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen, which is 6 brownies. When she got home, her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her, which is 48 brownies. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Then, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ 48 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old. The total age of all three family members is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."

"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The first two phones are priced at $600 each, so the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:

"Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be 5 years from now. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, meaning his dad will be 48 years old. Also, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

To find their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
```
50

"Adrianne received beads from her mother, sister, and friend. Her mother gave her 20 beads, her sister gave her 10 more than her mother (which is 30 beads), and her friend gave her twice as many as her mother (which is 40 beads). Adding these together:

- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90

So, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether."
"On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

The total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days is:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. So, the number of football players is:
\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

The remaining students are:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, the number of cheerleaders and band members is:
\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Adding the football players, cheerleaders, and band members, the total number of students leaving early is:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

"Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's. Since Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots would be:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

To find the average size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie, we add their sizes and divide by 2:

\[ \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petunias needed.
2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

First, let's find the total number of petunias needed:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

Next, let's find the total number of sweet potato vines needed:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

Finally, let's add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
- Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[
\boxed{70}

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the tasks and calculate the time required for each.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be done sequentially, the total time required is the sum of the time for peeling and sauturing:

"Kai here.

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Given the information:
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the given information:
1. \(A = 3\)
2. \(B = 4\)
3. \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
4. \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

   \[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]
3. For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge is:
   \[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]
4. We know that after 8 hours, the charge is 28%, so:
   \[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]
5. Calculate the values:
   \[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
   \[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]
6. Substitute these values into the equation:
   \[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
   \[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
7. Solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for a $2,000 down payment, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Janet's total hourly earnings: $10 (wages) + $15 (tips) = $25 per hour.
2. Calculate her weekly earnings: $25 per hour * 40 hours per week = $1,000 per week.
3. Determine the number of weeks needed to save $2,000: $2,000 / $1,000 per week = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"Jamaar has $10 to spend on fruits. The costs are as follows: peaches and pears are $0.50 each, apples are $0.75 each, kiwis are $1 each, and plums are $0.25 each. He has already bought 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples.

First, calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:
- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Subtract this from the $10 he started with to find out how much he has left:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

So, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining how many pictures are in each album. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and distributed them evenly into 8 albums. Therefore, the number of pictures per album is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[
\boxed{98}

First, we need to convert Xavier's height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's original height in inches is:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know Cole's original height is 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer. So, Cole's current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Convert the time worked per day into hours:**
   - A day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - So, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

Therefore, each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.

**Final Answer:**
47.25"
"Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"There are 50 books in a small library. Half of them are written in English, which means there are 25 English books.

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear. 

**Final Answer: $55**"
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required and then multiply by the cost per tile.

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"James's insurance cost after the accident is 60% more than the normal cost of $120 per month. First, we calculate the increase in cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."

Now, let's sum up the total number of stickers:

- Stickers from two years ago: 100
- Stickers collected last year: 50
- Stickers collected this year: 100

Total stickers = 100 + 50 + 100 = 250

So, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption first. Imma has 3 cats, and each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day. So, the daily consumption for one cat is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{2}\) days."

Now, let's sum up the slices eaten by all three:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

So, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtracting 18 from both sides, we have:

\[2D = 80\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

Melanie is saving toothpicks from her mom's sandwiches. She has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture.

First, calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, calculate the number of additional weeks needed to save the remaining toothpicks:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, which means he paid:

\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for, which means the friend paid:

\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

The friend bought the watch for $1800, while the original price was $2000. The discount amount is:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is:

\[ \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Rate of Jellyfish Creation per Spring:**
   - Each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

2. **Total Time in Seconds:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Jellyfish Created by One Spring in 4 Hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

4. **Jellyfish Created by 5 Springs in 4 Hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

Therefore, the final answer is:
```
72000

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from 10 bunches:
   - Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
   - Total bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

2. Calculate the total cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually:
   - The cost of one banana is $0.80.
   - Total cost for individual bananas = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

3. Calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
   - The cost of one bunch is $3.00.
   - Total cost for bunches = 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

4. Calculate the savings:
   - Savings = Total cost for individual bananas - Total cost for bunches.
   - Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"Kai here!

John has 8 classes in a week, each 40 minutes long. So, the total time spent in classes is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of Saturday and Sunday. So, the extra learning time on each of these days is:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

For both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time gives:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting the total weekly learning time to hours:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spends 6 hours a week learning.

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls.

- The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(10 \times 8 = 80\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) square feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, so each wall has an area of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) square feet. Since there are two such walls, the total area for these walls is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240\] square feet.

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12\] gallons.

Finally, since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144\] dollars.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Anna's initial budget is $16.
2. She has already spent $4.
3. After buying 2 books today, she has $2 left.

First, calculate the total amount spent:
\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]

Next, subtract the amount spent before buying the books:
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Since she bought 2 books and spent the same amount on each, the cost of each book is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, the cost of each book is $5.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate as follows:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"John visits his parents twice a month. Each visit involves a round trip that takes 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph. 

First, calculate the one-way distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, calculate the round trip distance:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Since John visits his parents twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 2 \times 280 \, \text{miles} = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce 400 toys in total and still needs another 20 toys to complete the order. This means the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Kris received 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob, so Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.
2. Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris, meaning Luis originally had 16 stickers.
3. Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, so the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half. Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.
4. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the 32 stickers Luis had must be half of what Seth originally had. Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so if Arnold painted \(A\) eggs, Madeline also painted \(A\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. If Sarah painted \(S\) eggs, then Camden painted \(S + 12\) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

From the information given:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \(S = 9\) back into \(A + S = 22\):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted \(S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\) eggs.

The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"Given that Grandma walks 3 miles every day, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk, and knowing that she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, we can determine the total time for her walk.

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Given: 40 minutes.

2. **Distance on the beach:**
   - Given: 2 miles.

3. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed on the beach in miles per minute.
   - Since \( 40 \) minutes is the time to walk 2 miles, \( v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute.

4. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Given that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach, the speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.

5. **Distance on the sidewalk:**
   - Given: 1 mile.

6. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed, so the time spent on the sidewalk is \( \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \) minutes.

7. **Total time for the entire walk:**

"Jane has been saving $4 every week for the past 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Her goal is to save a total of $60. Therefore, the amount she still needs to save is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60 is \(\boxed{7}\)."

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the first mug and 1 ounce from the second mug).

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

1. Total distance:
   - First part: 110 miles
   - Second part: 140 miles
   - Total distance = 110 + 140 = 250 miles

2. Total time:
   - First part: 2 hours
   - Second part: 3 hours
   - Total time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours

3. Average speed:
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour."
"The probability of winning the first lottery ticket is 20%, or 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so the probability of winning the second ticket is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each event:
\[0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12\]

Expressing this as a percentage:
\[0.12 \times 100 = 12\%\]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Jim collected 27 seashells.
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\) seashells.

Now, let's find the total number of seashells collected by all three:
\[ 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \]

Since they decided to divide the seashells equally, each person will get:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason eats 4 carrots each day on weekdays (Monday to Friday), which totals to \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots. On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he eats 5 carrots each day, which totals to \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots. Adding these together, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots in a week.

The final answer is 30."
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of both songs:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

The total cassette time is 13 minutes."
"Kai here!

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the selling price of one mobile device:**
   - Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
   - He sells it for twice the original price.
   - Therefore, the selling price is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

2. **Determine the total cost of the devices bought:**
   - Linus bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday.
   - Total number of devices bought = \(2 + 4 = 6\).
   - Total cost = \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.

3. **Determine the total revenue from selling the devices:**
   - Linus sold all 6 devices at $40 each.
   - Total revenue = \(6 \times 40 = 240\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Profit = \(240 - 120 = 120\) dollars.

So, the final answer is:

"Given the information:

- Isabel is 7 feet tall.
- Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel.
- Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned.
- Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.

First, calculate Ned's height:
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, calculate Carl's height:
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, determine the length of Carl's cane:
\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of Octuplets**: 8
2. **Number Dressed in Purple**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)
3. **Number Dressed in Blue**: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Next, we determine how many of these are wearing bows:
- All 2 blue-wearers are wearing bows.
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the 6 purple-wearers are wearing bows, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\).

So, the total number of bow-wearers is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

We need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Converting this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

So, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[
\boxed{170}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs equal \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.
2. Lamar finds 5 eggs.
3. Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(5 \times 2 = 10\) eggs.
4. Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
5. Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(8 \div 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up the total number of eggs found:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the initial number of eggs:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, let's break it down year by year:

- **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
- **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
- **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
- **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

So, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - After giving an equal amount \(x\) to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister, so the amount left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"The total area of Tom's house can be calculated by adding the areas of all the rooms together.

1. Calculate the area of one bedroom: \(20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}\).
2. Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is \(4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet}\).
3. The living room is 5 times the size of one bedroom, so its area is \(5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet}\).
4. The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Adding all these areas together gives the total area of the house:
\[960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet}\].

Therefore, the total area of the house is \(\boxed{3160}\) square feet."

"The regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. The special size box, which costs the same $12, contains 20% more pods. 

First, calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box has 120 pods for $12. To find the cost per pod in the special size box:
\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:
\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20

"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we find out how many books Bob can buy with $27000. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of 500 dollars buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.
   - Converting 300 minutes into hours: \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"When Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it came out 20 years ago. John is currently 28 years old, so 20 years ago, he was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old at that time. Since 20 years have passed since then, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Final answer: Jim is 24 years old."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The difference is \(109 - 78 = 31\), which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is:
\[12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\]

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average:

Given that the average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles, the total miles for all 4 dogs is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."

"Kai here.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs. Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. So, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the eggs. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

"To return home, Phineas Frog needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, he will need to cover 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Finally, add the time spent on land and in water to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on land + Time in water = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, it will take Phineas Frog 15 minutes to return home."

"John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed increases to 2.5 times his original speed.

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages.

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

To find out how long it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) more kernels pop.

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

So, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of T-shirts:**
   - Each T-shirt originally costs $8.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal.
   - The first T-shirt costs $8.
   - The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Cost of shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
   - The cost of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

3. **Total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes.
   - Total amount = $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \boxed{36}."
"Kai here.

First, let's calculate Ryan's total allowance over 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, over 3 weeks he earns:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for 4 ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the ice cream cones from his total earnings, Ryan has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining $13. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one ticket:
\[ \left\lfloor \frac{13}{6.50} \right\rfloor = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's calculate the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani.

First, we'll find out how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100.
- She also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, the total amount Ellen spent is:
\[ 100 + 5 = 105 \]

Next, we'll calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- She also bought two bathrobes, each costing $100. So, the cost for the bathrobes is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]
Therefore, the total amount Lani spent is:
\[ 30 + 200 = 230 \]

Now, we add the amounts spent by Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent by both of them:
\[ 105 + 230 = 335 \]

So, the total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is:
\[ \boxed{335} \]"
"To determine the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar and then find the profit per jar. Finally, we will multiply the profit per jar by 10 to get the total profit.

1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:**
   - Passion fruit: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12\)
   - Jackfruit: \(1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12\)

2. **Total cost for one jar:**
   \[
   \$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit for one jar:**
   - Selling price per jar: \$50
   - Cost per jar: \$44
   \[
   \text{Profit per jar} = \$50 - \$44 = \$6
   \]

4. **Calculate the total profit for 10 jars:**
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = 10 \times \$6 = \$60
   \]

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is \(\boxed{60}\)."

"Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate gets home, he fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes each night, resulting in a net gain of 3 holes each day:
\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

To fill 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day, it will take:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks it takes to fill all the holes is:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which means Igor gathered \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which means Igor gathered \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. Let the number of beakers Igor brought be \(x\). Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor lost \(7 - x\) beakers.
4. The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29
   \]
5. Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   8 + x + 16 = 29
   \]
   \[
   24 + x = 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 29 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]
6. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers and Igor brought 5, the number of beakers lost is:

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The original cost of the radiator is $400.
2. He gets it at 80% off, which means he pays 20% of the original cost.
   \[
   \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80
   \]
3. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.
   \[
   \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150
   \]
4. Adding the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor gives us the total amount paid.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230

So, the final amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. Set up the equations based on the given information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( c + k = 20 \)
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

3. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

4. Now we have the system of equations:
   - \( c + k = 20 \)
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

5. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   - \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \)
   - \( k = 15 \)

6. Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   - \( c + 15 = 20 \)
   - \( c = 5 \)

So, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
