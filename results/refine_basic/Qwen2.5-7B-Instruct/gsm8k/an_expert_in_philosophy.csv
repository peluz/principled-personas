"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the ethical and practical dimensions of Janet's actions. From an ethical standpoint, Janet is engaging in a form of resource management and distribution. She is using a portion of the eggs for her own consumption and another portion for baking, with the remainder being sold at the farmers' market.

Philosophically, we can analyze this scenario through the lens of utilitarianism, which focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number. In this case, Janet is maximizing the economic benefit from her duck eggs by selling the surplus, which could be seen as contributing to the well-being of her community through her sales.

To quantify the economic benefit, we can simply calculate the monetary value of the eggs she sells. Janet has 16 eggs per day, uses 7 for her own consumption, and thus has 9 eggs left to sell. At $2 per egg, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs is:

\[ 9 \text{ eggs} \times \$2/\text{egg} = \$18 \]

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total number of bolts needed for the robe, we need to consider the requirements for both blue and white fibers. According to the problem, the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that amount in white fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber required is:

\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Adding the bolts of blue and white fiber together, we get:

\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

Thus, the total number of bolts needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow a structured approach grounded in the principles of practical philosophy, which involves analyzing the given data and applying logical reasoning.

1. **Initial Purchase and Repair Costs:**
   - Josh buys the house for $80,000.
   - He spends $50,000 on repairs.

2. **Total Investment:**
   - Total cost = Purchase price + Repair cost
   - Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

3. **Value Increase:**
   - The value of the house increased by 150%.
   - 150% of the original purchase price = 1.5 × $80,000 = $120,000
   - New value of the house = Original purchase price + Value increase
   - New value of the house = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

4. **Calculating Profit:**
   - Profit = New value of the house - Total investment
   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Therefore, Josh's profit from flipping the house is \(\boxed{70000}\)."
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. James runs 3 sprints each time he exercises.
2. Each sprint is 60 meters.
3. He exercises 3 times a week.

First, calculate the distance James runs in one session:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Next, calculate the total distance he runs in a week:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total daily feed requirement for Wendi's flock. Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day, and she has 20 chickens. Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we account for the feed already given in the morning and afternoon. Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, which totals:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. This pattern repeats for each pair of glasses.

Given that Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the cost as follows:

1. Each pair of glasses (one at $5 and one at $3) costs $8.
2. Since 16 glasses form 8 pairs, the total cost is \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay is $64.

**Final Answer:**
$64"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   - Total number of sheep = Number of sheep in Toulouse + Number of sheep in Charleston + Number of sheep in Seattle
   - Total number of sheep = \( 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, we need to break down the process into several steps and calculate the time for each segment.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of his 4-hour return trip, let's break down the journey step by step.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular and overtime hours, applying the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Month**: The program had 60 downloads.
2. **Second Month**: The number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
3. **Third Month**: The downloads reduced by 30%, meaning the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 \times 0.70 = 126
   \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
\[
60 + 180 + 126 = 366
\]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]"
"To determine the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

1. **Donuts:**
   - Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - The cost per dozen is $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider both the initial cost and the annual net profit.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Revenue**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, which can be sold for $1.5 each. Therefore, the annual revenue is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.
4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

To find the break-even point, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the logical sequence of events and the information provided.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \). Therefore, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). After this sale, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

We can set up the equation based on the information that she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Next, we add 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

Then, we multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( 2x \):
\[
2x = 36
\]

Finally, we divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \):
\[
x = 18
\]

Therefore, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."

4. **Hip-Hop Dance Enrollment:**
   - The remaining students who enrolled in hip-hop dance are \( 16 - 4 = 12 \) students.

5. **Percentage of Hip-Hop Dance Enrollees:**
   - To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:
     \[
     \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\%
     \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is \(\boxed{60\%}\)."
"In this scenario, the merchant is faced with a decision between purchasing jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The financial advisor predicts that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% and the electronic gadgets market by 1.2% within the same month. To determine which purchase will yield the highest profit, we need to calculate the value of each purchase after the speculated market increase.

1. **Jewelry Calculation:**
   - Initial value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Value after increase: \( 5000 \times (1 + 0.025) = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125 \)
   - Profit: \( 5125 - 5000 = 125 \)

2. **Electronic Gadgets Calculation:**
   - Initial value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Value after increase: \( 8000 \times (1 + 0.012) = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8096 \)
   - Profit: \( 8096 - 8000 = 96 \)

Given these calculations, the merchant would maximize profit by choosing the electronic gadgets, as the profit from electronic gadgets is higher.

**Final Answer:**
The maximum profit the merchant can achieve is $96."

"To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both her teaching and coaching jobs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Teaching Earnings:**
   - Jill earns $20 per hour.
   - She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
   - Her weekly earnings from teaching are \(35 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700\).
   - Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are \(50 \text{ weeks} \times \$700/\text{week} = \$35,000\).

2. **Coaching Earnings:**
   - Jill earns $30 per hour.
   - She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
   - Her weekly earnings from coaching are \(15 \text{ hours} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450\).
   - Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are \(50 \text{ weeks} \times \$450/\text{week} = \$22,500\).

3. **Total Annual Salary:**
   - Adding her annual earnings from both jobs, we get \(\$35,000 + \$22,500 = \$57,500\).

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is \(\$57,500\)."

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire eats 3 eggs every morning.
2. **Weekly Egg Consumption**: Over a week (7 days), she consumes \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs.
3. **Monthly Egg Consumption**: Over 4 weeks, she consumes \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.
4. **Conversion to Dozens**: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens she consumes is \(\frac{84}{12} = 7\) dozens.

Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these philosophical and logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Goal**: Marissa aims to hike a 12-mile trail with an average speed of 4 miles per hour. This means she needs to complete the hike in a total of 3 hours (since \( \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \)).

2. **Time Already Spent**: Marissa has already spent 2 hours hiking the first 6 miles (1 hour for 4 miles and another hour for 2 miles).

3. **Remaining Time**: Since she has 3 hours in total and has already spent 2 hours, she has 1 hour left to complete the remaining 6 miles.

4. **Required Speed**: To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time. Therefore, the required speed is \( \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \).

Thus, the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance is \(\boxed{6}\) miles per hour."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after mixing the orange and pineapple drinks, accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from the remaining orange drink and the pineapple drink to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Samantha is currently 31 years old.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is currently \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.
3. Raymond had his son at the age of 23, which means Raymond's son is currently \(25 - 23 = 2\) years younger than Raymond.
4. Therefore, Raymond's son is currently \(31 - 2 = 29\) years old.
5. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract his current age from Samantha's current age: \(31 - 29 = 2\).

"To determine how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of item and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
\[
3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
\]
So, Mishka spent $49.50 on shorts.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
\[
3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
\]
So, Mishka spent $67.50 on pants.

Then, let's calculate the total cost for the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
\[
3 \times 42 = 126
\]
So, Mishka spent $126 on shoes.

Now, we sum the amounts spent on each type of item to find the total amount spent:
\[
49.50 + 67.50 + 126 = 243
\]

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is \(\boxed{243}\) dollars."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we can break down the problem into a few logical steps:

1. **Calculate Total Servings Needed**: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume:
   \[
   60 \text{ servings}
   \]

2. **Determine Cartons Needed**: Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are required, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
   \]

3. **Calculate Total Cost**: Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Henry's total trip is 60 miles.
2. He stopped after 20 miles, so the distance from the start to his first stop is 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip is 60 miles, 15 miles before the end would be at 45 miles (60 - 15 = 45).

To find the distance between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\) miles."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the given information and applying logical reasoning.

1. **Identify the Costs of the High Heels:**
   - One pair of high heels costs $33.
   - The other pair costs twice as much, which is \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the Total Cost of the High Heels:**
   - The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \(33 + 66 = 99\) dollars.

3. **Relate the Cost of the Boots to the High Heels:**
   - The problem states that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, if we let \(B\) represent the cost of the boots, we can write the equation:
     \[
     B - 5 = 99
     \]

4. **Solve for the Cost of the Boots:**
   - To find \(B\), we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     B = 99 + 5 = 104
     \]

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age. The ratio of their ages is 7:11, and their total age is 162.

Let's denote Darrell's current age as \(7x\) and Allen's current age as \(11x\). According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we first need to identify each individual guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so adding 20 gives 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so adding 20 to 80 gives 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can follow a structured approach:

1. **Daily Care Calculation**: Each dog requires 0.5 hours per day for care. Since John has 10 dogs, the total daily care time is:
   \[
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

2. **Weekly Care Calculation**: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care time is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

To find the number of gold coins, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, using the second equation to find \( G \):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, adhering to the logical reasoning required.

1. **Determine Aaron's Jewels:**
   - Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Half of Raymond's jewels is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
   - Therefore, Aaron has \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels.

2. **Determine Siobhan's Jewels:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Aaron has 25 jewels.
   - Therefore, Siobhan has \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels.

Thus, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine the total points Mike scored in his ping pong game, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

Next, we need to calculate the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. The problem states that he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points, we use the following calculation:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add the points from both halves of the game to find the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can break down the problem into a few logical steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, he will consume \(2 \times 30 = 60\) yogurts.

2. **Determine the number of sets of 4 yogurts in 60 yogurts:**
   - Since each set contains 4 yogurts, the number of sets is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) sets.

3. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets:**
   - Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 sets is \(15 \times 5 = 75\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of exchange and the concept of value. John initially has 13 lego sets, each valued at $15. When he sells these, he exchanges them for money, which he then uses to purchase video games and retains some leftover cash.

Let's break down the transactions:
1. John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, totaling $195.
2. He buys 8 video games at $20 each, spending $160.
3. After these transactions, he has $5 left.

The question asks how many lego sets he still has. Given that he has $30 left after buying the video games and having $5 remaining, and knowing each lego set was sold for $15, he must have 2 lego sets left (since $30 / $15 = 2).

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to analyze the information given and calculate the distance he runs each day, then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distances Dana covers while running and walking, given her speeds and the time spent on each activity.

First, let's establish the speeds:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her running speed is twice her skipping speed, so it is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.
- Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so it is \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the time spent on each activity:
- Total time: 6 hours.
- Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) hours.
- Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4\) hours.

Now, we calculate the distances:
- Distance running: \(6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\).
- Distance walking: \(1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}\).

Adding these distances together gives the total distance traveled:
\[12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}\].

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."

   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we start by calculating the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of moderation and self-regulation in relation to caloric intake. The question involves a practical application of these principles.

Given that a 300g bag of chips contains 1250 calories (5 servings of 250 calories each), and you have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories, with 1800 calories already consumed, you have 200 calories left for the day.

To determine how many grams of chips you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we use the following calculation:

1. **Calories per gram of chips**: 
   \[
   \text{Calories per gram} = \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories/gram}
   \]

2. **Grams of chips you can consume**:
   \[
   \text{Grams of chips} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.17 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
   \]

Therefore, you can consume approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - Therefore, to make 20 candles, he needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of time and productivity. The task at hand involves calculating the total number of hours spent on writing articles over three days. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
3. **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Adding these up, the total number of articles written over the three days is:
\[ 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is \(\boxed{104}\)."
"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can follow a logical sequence of steps based on the information provided.

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes at work.
3. After using these notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the package is \( 80 + x \).

After using 220 Post-it notes at work, the number of Post-it notes left is:
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

We can solve this equation to find \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]
\[ x - 140 = 23 \]
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove after removing 30 comic books to achieve a total weight reduction of 15 pounds.

First, let's calculate the weight of the 30 comic books. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, so the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more weight needs to be removed to reach the total of 15 pounds. This is calculated by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight that needs to be removed:
\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, so the number of toys that need to be removed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds is:
\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concept of revenue as a form of exchange or transaction. In this scenario, the mechanic is engaging in a service exchange, where the value of the service (repairing tires) is quantified in monetary terms.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. The revenue from truck tires is calculated as \(6 \times \$60 = \$360\), and the revenue from car tires is \(4 \times \$40 = \$160\). Therefore, the total revenue for Thursday is \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\).

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires, with no truck tires repaired. The revenue from car tires is \(12 \times \$40 = \$480\). Therefore, the total revenue for Friday is \(\$480\).

To determine how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue, we compare the two days. Thursday's revenue is \$520, and Friday's revenue is \$480. The difference in revenue is \(\$520 - \$480 = \$40\).

Thus, the mechanic earned \(\boxed{40}\) dollars more on Thursday."

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the structure of her pension plan. Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 for the first 20 years. After 20 years, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension per year.

First, we calculate the additional pension she receives after 20 years. The additional pension is 5% of $50,000, which is:
\[ 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \]

Since she quits after 30 years, she will receive this additional pension for 10 years (from year 21 to year 30). Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years is the sum of her initial annual pension and the additional pension:
\[ 50,000 + 2,500 = 52,500 \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $52,500.

**Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{52500} \]"
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves and then sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Total for the first half: \( 6 \times 140 = 840 \) dollars.

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the second half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is reduced by 10%.

   - Total for the second half: \( 6 \times 126 = 756 \) dollars.

3. **Total Amount Paid by the End of the Year:**
   - Sum of the amounts for the first and second halves: \( 840 + 756 = 1596 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is \(\boxed{1596}\)."
"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then apply it to the capacity of her tank.

First, we find the car's miles per gallon (mpg). Sophia has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, her car's fuel efficiency is:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Next, we use this efficiency to determine how far she can drive on a full tank. Her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. Thus, the distance she can travel on a full tank is:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of time and consumption in the context of Cecilia's responsibility towards her puppy. The question essentially asks about the quantity of dog food required for the first year, which can be broken down into two parts: the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

1. **First 180 Days:**
   - Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = 180 cups.

2. **Remaining Days of the Year:**
   - There are 365 days in a year.
   - After the first 180 days, there are 185 days left in the year.
   - For these remaining days, the puppy will be fed 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days = 185 days × 2 cups/day = 370 cups.

3. **Total Dog Food for the First Year:**
   - Total dog food for the first year = 180 cups (first 180 days) + 370 cups (remaining 185 days) = 550 cups.

4. **Bags of Dog Food Needed:**
   - One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the relationships and ratios between the amounts of laundry done by David, Sarah, and Raymond as a metaphor for understanding proportionality and comparative quantities.

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much as David, we can deduce that David does 100 pounds of laundry (since \(400 \div 4 = 100\)).

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, which means he does 200 pounds of laundry (since \(400 \div 2 = 200\)).

The difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is then calculated by subtracting the amount David does from the amount Raymond does: \(200 - 100 = 100\).

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \(\boxed{100}\) pounds."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down philosophically. We are given that a football team played a total of 22 games and that the number of games they won is 8 more than the number of games they lost. We need to determine the number of games they won.

Let's denote the number of games won as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The number of games won is 8 more than the number of games lost.

We can express these as the following equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

To find the values of \( W \) and \( L \), we can substitute the second equation into the first equation. This gives us:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
Subtracting 8 from both sides, we have:
\[ 2L = 14 \]
Dividing both sides by 2, we find:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games the team won is \(\boxed{15}\)."

   - The combined number of dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

4. **Determining the Number of Rabbits:**
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

5. **Calculating the Total Number of Pets:**
   - The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits, which is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - The total number of students is 200.
   - \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys.
   - Therefore, the number of boys is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \).

2. **Determine the number of girls:**
   - The rest of the students are girls.
   - So, the number of girls is \( 200 - 80 = 120 \).

3. **Determine the number of girls in the girl scout:**
   - \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout.
   - Therefore, the number of girls in the girl scout is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \).

4. **Determine the number of girls not in the girl scout:**
   - The number of girls not in the girl scout is \( 120 - 80 = 40 \).

Thus, the number of girls not in the girl scout is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine how many more hours Harry slept compared to James, we start by calculating the amount of sleep James had. Given that James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, and Harry slept 9 hours, we can calculate James's sleep as follows:

\[
\text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we find the difference in their sleep durations by subtracting the amount of sleep James had from the amount Harry had:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Volume Loss**: Each can of tomatoes, when turned into sauce, loses half its volume. Therefore, 16 ounces of tomatoes produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Total Sauce Volume**: Freda's batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce.

3. **Number of Cans Used**: To find out how many cans were used, we divide the total volume of sauce by the volume produced by one can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

4. **Tomatoes per Can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

5. **Total Number of Tomatoes**: To find the total number of tomatoes used, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the total number of cars and the changes that occur during the traffic jam. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Exiting**: 5 cars take an exit, so they do not participate in the traffic jam.
3. **Cars Passing Through**: After the first 15 minutes, some cars pass through, and then 20 more cars pass through in the next 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that pass through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that pass through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that pass in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

Since 5 cars take an exit, the number of cars that pass through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary, an avid gardener, received 18 new potted plants from her nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family. 

First, calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, determine how many plants she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtract the plants she will give away from her current total:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, let's analyze the information provided:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, summing up all the doorbell rings:

\[
20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

"John's water consumption can be analyzed through the lens of habitual behavior and daily routines. Over the course of a week, John maintains a consistent pattern of drinking water with his meals and before bed, with the exception of the weekend when he opts for soda with dinner.

- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):** John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. This amounts to 4 glasses of water per day. Therefore, over 5 weekdays, he consumes \(4 \times 5 = 20\) glasses of water.
- **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):** John continues to drink water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. This amounts to 3 glasses of water per day. Therefore, over 2 weekend days, he consumes \(3 \times 2 = 6\) glasses of water.

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together, we get \(20 + 6 = 26\) glasses of water in a week.

**Final Answer: 26**"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use a proportional reasoning approach, a fundamental concept in philosophy and mathematics that helps us understand relationships between quantities.

Given that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, we need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles. We can set up the proportion as follows:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \):

\[
10 \times 42 = 3 \times x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
420 = 3x
\]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pieces**: The total number of pieces in the jigsaw puzzle is 1000.

2. **Poppy's Contribution**: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, after Poppy places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

3. **Mom's Contribution**: Poppy's mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, after her mom places her pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\)."

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box to find the inner dimensions.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from each dimension, we get:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using these dimensions:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of the question and the information provided.

Frankie's TV watching schedule is as follows:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: \(x\) episodes of a 30-minute show
- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours. We can set up the equation to find the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday.

The equation is:
\[1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering Henry's baking process and the final count of cookies.

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he intended to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies.
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 100 \implies x = 50

"When considering the scenario where a local gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon and an app company offers a cashback of $0.20 per gallon for purchases made at this station, we can calculate the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback reward.

First, we calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas without the cashback:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Finally, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost of the gas after the cashback reward is:
\[ \$28.00 \]"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to follow a structured approach:

   - Total for Beatrice = \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

2. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
   - Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
   - Total for Marcell = \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

3. Add the totals from both to get the combined total:
   - Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

4. Find the average by dividing the combined total by 2:
   - Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Julia's boat is taking on water at a specific rate as she rows back to shore. We need to determine the total amount of water taken on by the time she reaches the shore.

2. **Rate of Water Intake**: The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. This gives us a rate of water intake of 0.2 liters per foot.

3. **Distance to Shore**: Julia needs to row 64 seconds to reach the shore. Given that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the total distance she needs to row:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Calculating Total Water Intake**: Using the rate of water intake (0.2 liters per foot) and the total distance (80 feet), we can find the total amount of water taken on:
   \[
   \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.2 \text{ liters per foot} = 16 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is \(\boxed{16}\) liters."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the quantities given.

1. Let \( J \) represent the maximum number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.
2. Let \( B \) represent the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
3. Let \( D \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

From the problem, we know:
- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone: \( J = 6B \).
- Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph: \( B = 50D \).
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs: \( J = 1800 \).

First, substitute \( J = 1800 \) into the equation \( J = 6B \):
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, substitute \( B = 300 \) into the equation \( B = 50D \):
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate both her total cost and her total selling price, then find the difference between these two amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought:
- For the 2x4x10 boards: 10 boards at $10 each = $100.
- For the 4x4x10 boards: 5 boards at $16 each = $80.
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber after the 50% price increase:
- For the 2x4x10 boards: New price per board = $10 * 1.5 = $15. Total selling price = 10 boards * $15 = $150.
- For the 4x4x10 boards: New price per board = $16 * 1.5 = $24. Total selling price = 5 boards * $24 = $120.
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is $90."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13 and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons.

First, let's denote the amount of sugar as \(7x\) and the amount of water as \(13x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. The total amount used is the sum of the sugar and water, which is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the amount of sugar used, which is \(7x\). Substituting the value of \(x\), we get:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[\boxed{42}\]"

"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the principles of counting and addition. The scenario involves a series of containers and vehicles, which can be analyzed through the lens of numerical reasoning and set theory.

Initially, there are 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. This gives us a total of \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles on the first day. The next day, the total number of vehicles at the port increases to 30. To find out how many additional vehicles were brought in, we subtract the initial number of vehicles from the final total: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Given that each container contains 5 vehicles, we can determine the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the number of additional vehicles by the number of vehicles per container: \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current salaries of Adrien and Lylah, given the conditions provided.

1. **Determine Lylah's Salary Four Years Ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \).

2. **Determine Adrien's Current Salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current salary is \( 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's Current Salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is \( 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43,076.92 \).

4. **Calculate the Total Salary the Two Were Receiving Four Years Later:**
   - Adrien's current salary is $56,000.

"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to consider her running speeds in two segments of her run.

1. **First 3 hours:**
   - Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - The distance covered in the first 3 hours is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Remaining 4 hours:**
   - After the first 3 hours, Rosie runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour.
   - The distance covered in the remaining 4 hours is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Total distance:**
   - The total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is the sum of the distances covered in both segments:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(\boxed{50}\) miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Jennie has a total of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She stamps one-third of these letters. Therefore, the number of letters she stamps is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
3. After stamping, these 20 letters are added to the pile of already-stamped letters.
4. We know that after adding the 20 newly stamped letters, the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile is 30.

To find out how many letters were in the already-stamped pile initially, we subtract the 20 newly added letters from the total number of letters in the already-stamped pile:
\[
30 - 20 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began is:
\[

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concepts of efficiency, time management, and the nature of tasks. The question involves calculating the number of questions Mark left incomplete based on his rate of work and the time constraints given for each test.

First, let's analyze the first test:
- Mark completed 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 8 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he could have completed in 8 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, let's analyze the second test:
- Mark completed 100 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- He had 6 hours to complete the test.

The number of questions he could have completed in 6 hours is:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Since the test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:

\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the 20 available cars, we first need to identify the number of semi-automatic cars. Given that there are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars, the remaining cars must be semi-automatic.

The calculation for the number of semi-automatic cars is as follows:
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the different types of bees and the total number of bees in the hive.

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queen bees.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees, which is given as 700. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find the number of baby bees and worker bees:
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \]

Thus, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the value of time and the concept of opportunity cost. Jordan's decision to spend 2 hours daily on video games instead of working involves a trade-off between leisure and earning potential.

If Jordan were to work those 2 hours each day, he would accumulate a significant amount of earnings over a week. Specifically, at a rate of $10 per hour, the total earnings would be:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Thus, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is \(\$140\)."
"To determine the total cost of John's purchases, we need to first categorize the items as either food or non-food and then apply the tax to the non-food items.

- Milk: $2 (food)
- Eggs: $3 (food)
- Light bulbs: $3 (non-food)
- Cups: $3 (non-food)
- Roach traps: $4 (non-food)

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items is:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

   - Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples per harvest for the entire field is:
     \[
     10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of harvests in a year:**
   - John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of harvests per year is:
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   - The total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
     \[
     1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars based on the cost per tire.

First, let's break down the number of tires inflated for each type of vehicle:
- Bicycles: 5 people each with 2 tires, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- Tricycles: 3 people each with 3 tires, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- Unicycles: 1 person with 1 tire, so \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is:
\[10 + 9 + 1 = 20\] tires.

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, the total cost in cents is:
\[20 \times 25 = 500\] cents.

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars, we divide by 100:
\[500 \div 100 = 5\] dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:

"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final number of fries to determine the initial amount. Let's denote the initial number of fries as \( x \).

1. After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. This means before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
2. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, leaving one-third. So, if \( y \) is the number of fries before the raccoon, then \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). Therefore, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
3. Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries (since each of the three pigeons ate 3 fries).
4. Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries (since the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, and Dave ate 14 fries).
5. Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

Thus, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles.
2. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from under a lily pad, increasing the number of visible tadpoles to \(11 + 6 = 17\).
3. After that, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, reducing the number of visible tadpoles to \(17 - 2 = 15\).

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"The problem presented involves a series of changes in the depth of water in a tank over three days. Let's break it down step by step.

1. On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet, making the new depth:
   \[
   17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. On Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday, so we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is:
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ feet}}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Therefore, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:
  \[
  10 + 6 + 3 = 19
  \]

Next, we calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin:
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means:
  \[
  10 - 5 = 5 \text{ starfish}
  \]
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means:
  \[
  6 - 3 = 3 \text{ sea horses}
  \]
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means:
  \[
  3 + 2 = 5 \text{ clownfish}
  \]
- Therefore, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
  \[
  5 + 3 + 5 = 13
  \]

Finally, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:
\[
19 + 13 = 32
\]

Thus, the total number of fish they were able to catch is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the concept of compound interest. The original price of the bag of marbles is $20, and it increases by 20% every two months.

First, we need to determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:
\[
\frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
\]

The price after each period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
\[
P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
\]
where:
- \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
- \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
- \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:
\[
P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
\]
\[
P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
\]

Using a calculator to find \((1.20)^{18}\):
\[
(1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
\]

Now, we multiply the original price by this factor:
\[
P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
\]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of each type of toy:**
   - Each red car costs $4.
   - Each action figure costs $5.
   - The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so the doll costs \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost for each type of toy:**
   - Total cost of red cars: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
   - Total cost of action figures: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
   - Total cost of the doll: \(15\) dollars.

3. **Sum up the total cost of all toys:**
   - Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
   - Total cost = \(20 + 15 + 15 = 50\) dollars.

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of the relationship between Sandra and her neighbor, as well as the practical aspects of egg collection and flan preparation.

First, let's break down the problem:
- Sandra needs 45 eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.
- Her neighbor provides 9 eggs per babysitting session.

From a practical standpoint, we can calculate the number of babysitting sessions required:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/session}} = 5 \text{ sessions} \]

Thus, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to collect enough eggs for her Spanish flans.

"To solve this problem, let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the relationships between the ages of Seth and Brooke.

We are given two key pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

From the second piece of information, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her total minimum monthly payment across all her debts. The minimum payments are as follows:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we need to calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the amount Jessica pays in a year is:
\[ \boxed{18000} \]"

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the ethical implications of fulfilling Sandra's order. In this scenario, we are dealing with a situation where a supplier, Fred, must meet a specific demand to maintain a business relationship. The core question is: How many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm to fulfill his ethical and contractual obligations?

From a deontological standpoint, which focuses on the adherence to rules and duties, Fred has a clear duty to deliver the red roses as per the order. The number of red roses ordered is 160, as calculated based on the given information. Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses to fulfill his obligations and maintain the business relationship with Sandra.

From a consequentialist perspective, which considers the outcomes of actions, delivering the 160 red roses will likely result in a positive outcome for Fred, as it will preserve his business relationship with Sandra. This positive outcome justifies the action of delivering the roses.

Thus, the number of red roses Fred must deliver by 5 pm is \(\boxed{160}\)."

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:

The faster team will win by \(\boxed{8}\) seconds."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we need to consider the probabilities of two distinct events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a Number Greater Than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll.

The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
To determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

Therefore, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we can approach this problem through a philosophical lens, focusing on the principles of cost, revenue, and profit. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Costs and Revenue:**
   - The trader incurs a cost of $20 per bag for purchasing the wheat.
   - There is an additional cost of $2 per bag for transportation.
   - Therefore, the total cost per bag is $20 + $2 = $22.
   - The trader sells each bag for $30.

2. **Calculating the Profit per Bag:**
   - The profit per bag is the selling price minus the total cost: $30 - $22 = $8.

3. **Determining the Total Number of Bags:**
   - The trader made a total profit of $400.
   - If the profit per bag is $8, then the number of bags sold can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag: $400 / $8 = 50.

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."

2. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
3. The cost of the rides is $33 per ride for 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \]

Since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, each friend pays:
\[ \text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{102}{3} = 34 \]

Therefore, the amount each friend paid is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the number of peaches John collects, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the total time John spends collecting peaches in minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and John collects peaches for 3 hours, we have:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. Therefore, the total number of peaches he collects is:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
2. For a flock of ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is \(3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}\).
3. To find the daily requirement, we divide the weekly total by 7 days: \(\frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}\).

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach to understanding the dynamics of growth and decay.

1. **Initial State**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Annual Change**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net increase of 8 trees per year.
3. **Decade Calculation**: Over 10 years, the net increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.
4. **Total Trees After 10 Years**: Adding the net increase to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
5. **Tree Mortality**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. Therefore, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
6. **Final Count**: Subtracting the number of dead trees from the total, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Thus, the final number of trees Tom has left is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the changes in the number of pink and white flamingos over the weekend.

1. **Initial Placement on Friday:**
   - Sue's front yard had 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **Modification on Saturday:**
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos.
   - One third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \).
   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much change Violetta will receive, we need to follow a straightforward calculation based on the given information.

First, we calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has. Violetta has $20, so the change she will get is:
\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

Thus, the change Violetta will get is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the cost of one pen. According to the problem, a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, we can calculate the cost of one pen as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of a pencil} + \text{Cost of an eraser} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of 8 pens. Since one pen costs $1.50, the cost of 8 pens is:

\[
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}

"To address the problem philosophically, we can consider the distribution of resources and the principles of fairness and efficiency. In this scenario, we have 200 pounds of carrots to be distributed among 40 restaurants, with each restaurant to receive 2 pounds. 

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds per restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we determine the amount of carrots that will not be used by subtracting the distributed amount from the total amount available:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we can use basic arithmetic. Given the total population and the number of men and women, we can find the number of children by subtracting the sum of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23,786
Number of men = 8,417
Number of women = 9,092

Number of children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women
Number of children = 23,786 - 8,417 - 9,092
Number of children = 23,786 - 17,509
Number of children = 6,277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6,277."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering Elaine's collection over the months.

1. **Initial Collection:**
   Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **First Month Collection:**
   She collects three times the initial number of cards.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Second Month Collection:**
   She collects 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
   - He edits an equal number of sentences for each of the two publishers.
   - Therefore, he edits \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) sentences for each publisher.

2. **Calculate the payment from Publisher A:**
   - Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence.
   - For 500 sentences, the payment is \( 500 \times 5 = 2500 \) cents.

3. **Calculate the payment from Publisher B:**
   - Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence.
   - Therefore, Publisher B pays \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) cents per sentence.
   - For 500 sentences, the payment is \( 500 \times 10 = 5000 \) cents.

4. **Calculate the total payment:**
   - The total payment is the sum of the payments from both publishers.

"To determine the total amount of money John made in the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increased salary due to the 5% raise.

1. **Monetary Reward**: John receives a one-time reward of $5000.
2. **Salary Calculation**:
   - John's original weekly salary is $2000.
   - With a 5% raise, his new weekly salary is \(2000 + (2000 \times 0.05) = 2000 + 100 = 2100\) dollars.
   - Over the course of a year (52 weeks), his annual salary with the raise is \(2100 \times 52 = 109200\) dollars.
3. **Total Annual Earnings**:
   - Adding the one-time monetary reward to his annual salary: \(109200 + 5000 = 114200\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:

"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we can break down the problem into three parts: the cheese used for sandwiches, the cheese used for omelets, and the cheese used for macaroni and cheese.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days in a week.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 31\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\)."

"To determine the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts and then sum the results.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy. We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Therefore, each candied apple weighs 20g.

First, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ 25 \text{ chocolate bars} \times 40 \text{ g per chocolate bar} = 1000 \text{ g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ 80 \text{ candied apples} \times 20 \text{ g per candied apple} = 1600 \text{ g} \]

Adding these two weights together gives us the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 \text{ g} + 1600 \text{ g} = 2600 \text{ g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \(\boxed{2600}\) grams."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We add the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down philosophically and methodically.

First, we need to understand the relationship between the cost of plates and cups. We are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $6000.

1. **Determine the cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - The cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates, we subtract $1200 from $6000.
   - Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
   - The total cost for 240 cups is $4800.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup is $4800 / 240 = $20.

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is $20."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford a jacket and two pairs of shoes, given her earnings and savings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, we consider Sara's earnings:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.
- She already has $10 saved.

Now, let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \(x\). She earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so her total earnings from mowing the lawn are \(4x\) dollars.

The total amount of money Sara will have is the sum of her savings, her babysitting earnings, and her lawn mowing earnings:
\[10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[4x \geq 70 - 30\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the relationships between the given elements. Let's break it down step by step.

We are given:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). From the fourth point, we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens: \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers.
3. The total number of customers by the third day was 500. Therefore, the number of customers counted on the third day can be found by subtracting the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total.

So, the number of customers on the third day is:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the relationships between the pools and their water levels.

We are given that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's translate these statements into equations. 

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the first piece of information:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

According to the second piece of information:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours to afford the shoes and the belt. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{44}\)"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine Janeth's remaining balance after she has paid $165 per month for 12 months on a borrowed amount of $2000 with an additional 10%.

First, calculate the total amount Janeth promised to return:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, find the remaining balance by subtracting the total payment from the total amount to be returned:
\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, the remaining balance is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"In the vase, there are 4 roses. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their average age in three years.

1. **Current Age of Harriet**: Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.
2. **Current Age of Zack**: Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. **Current Age of Adrian**: Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- Time per crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles = 3
- Total time on crossword puzzles = 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- Time per sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of sudoku puzzles = 8
- Total time on sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Finally, we add the time spent on both activities to find the total time:
- Total time = Time on crossword puzzles + Time on sudoku puzzles
- Total time = 30 minutes + 40 minutes = 70 minutes

"Certainly! Let's approach this problem from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical steps and the essence of the question.

Initially, the water tank contains 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters, leaving 30 liters in the tank. The rainwater collected is twice the amount left, which is 60 liters. Adding the remaining water and the collected rainwater gives us the total amount of water in the tank now.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 30 \text{ liters (remaining)} + 60 \text{ liters (collected rainwater)} = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of petunias Andy plants. Given that he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, we can calculate the number of petunias as follows:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"To determine the total amount spent on advertising over two years, we start by noting the initial expenditure. The company spends $15,000 in the first year. For the second year, it spends a third of the first year's amount, which is:

\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total expenditure over the two years:

\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent on advertising for the two years is:

\[ \boxed{20000} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the rentals for Carlos and Benji, we need to calculate the individual costs and then sum them up.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour and uses it for 3 hours. Therefore, the cost for Carlos is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour and uses it for 5 hours. Therefore, the cost for Benji is:
\[ 18 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 90 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount they will pay for their rentals, altogether, is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new number of each type of card:**
   - Fire type: Remains 30.
   - Grass type: Increases by 14, so it becomes \(20 + 14 = 34\).
   - Water type: Decreases by 8, so it becomes \(40 - 8 = 32\).

2. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   \[
   30 \text{ (fire type)} + 34 \text{ (grass type)} + 32 \text{ (water type)} = 96
   \]

3. **Determine the probability of picking a water type card:**
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

4. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of placing puzzle pieces per minute and then find out how many minutes it will take to place all 360 pieces.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which means her mom can place 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can place:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. This means:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons are taken home, leaving:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. This means:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons are harvested, leaving:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the process of converting empty pens into full pens and how this affects the total number of pens Ram has over time.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram starts with 25 pens.

2. **Conversion Process**: For every 5 empty pens, Ram can make 1 new pen. This means that from the initial 25 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]

3. **Total Pens After First Cycle**: After using the 25 pens to make 5 new pens, Ram now has:
   \[
   25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \text{ pens}
   \]

4. **Second Conversion**: Now, Ram has 5 pens. He can use these 5 pens to make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}

"To determine the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A:**
   - 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A:**
   - Subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students.
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students remain.

3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B:**
   - \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the changes in the number of French fries Griffin has, step by step.

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, leaving Griffin with \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. This leaves Griffin with \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. This leaves Griffin with \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

"To solve this problem, we need to apply logical reasoning and basic arithmetic. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The problem states that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in the other, so the difference in the number of snails is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Thus, there are 7 fish in each aquarium. The correct answer is:

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of consumption and the concept of surplus. In this scenario, Sue's consumption of cookies can be seen as a form of surplus, where she consumes more than what is necessary or what her sister consumes.

Let's break down the consumption:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies, and Sue ate 4 times as many, which is 20 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies, and Sue ate twice as many, which is 26 cookies.

In total:
- Sue's sister consumed \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.
- Sue consumed \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

The difference in calories consumed is:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \]

Thus, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
2. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract it from 30:
   \[
   30 \times 0.30 = 9
   \]
   So, Anne went down the slide:
   \[
   30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times}

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

Initially, there are 10 stalls, each containing 20 cows. Therefore, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and distributes them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall receives:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

Adding these 2 new cows to the original 20 cows in each stall, the new total number of cows in each stall is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the redwood after termites have eaten 30% of it. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it:**
   - The redwood is 200 feet tall.
   - Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total number of 10-foot sections is \( \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \).
   - The total weight of the redwood is \( 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \).

2. **Determine the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it:**
   - The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so 70% of the redwood remains.
   - The remaining weight is \( 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is \(\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}\)."

"To determine the amount of flour Carla needs, we can approach this problem through a philosophical lens of practical reasoning and logical deduction.

First, we need to establish the relationship between the number of cookies and the amount of flour required. According to the given information, 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies. This establishes a ratio that we can use to calculate the amount of flour for any number of cookies.

Next, we calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making:
\[ 36 \text{ cookies today} + 30 \text{ cookies tomorrow} = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we use the ratio to find out how much flour is needed for 66 cookies. Since 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the correct amount of flour Carla will need is \(\boxed{11}\) cups."
"To determine the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we first need to calculate the number of pennies in the stack. Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we calculate two thirds of this amount:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6200
\]

So, the stack contains 6,200 pennies. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we convert 6,200 pennies to dollars by dividing by 100:

\[
6200 \div 100 = 62
\]

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to break down the process into its components and calculate each step.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Time taken: 20 minutes

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - The time taken is 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees.
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - The time taken to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

4. **Total time:**
   - Total time is the sum of the time to heat to 300 degrees, the time to heat to 400 degrees, and the time to cook the chicken.
   - Total time = \(20 + 28 + 23 = 71\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."

"In philosophy, the concept of change and the passage of time is a fundamental topic of discussion. When considering the ages of Mico and Marco, we can apply a similar philosophical perspective to understand their situation.

Currently, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages is 20. Philosophically, we can think about how the nature of time and change affects this sum. In 10 years, each of them will have aged by 10 years. Therefore, the total increase in their combined age will be 20 years (10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco).

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ 20 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the relationships between the ages of Ruby and Sam.

We are given two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information, in 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Substituting \( R = 6S \) into the second equation, we get:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
\[ 6S - 3S = 27 - 9 \]
\[ 3S = 18 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can deduce that a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. With 40 cobras, each having 70 spots, the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. With 60 mambas, each having 35 spots, the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding these together gives the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, to find half of this combined total number of spots, we perform the following calculation:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

Calculating the value of the quarters:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Calculating the value of the dimes:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these values together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money Kelly has. The can of pop costs 55 cents.

Subtracting the cost of the pop from the total amount:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left after buying the can of pop is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of rows of 5 stars on a 76-star flag, given that it has three rows of 8 stars and two rows of 6 stars.

First, calculate the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 \times 6 = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

Next, subtract the number of stars in these rows from the total number of stars on the flag to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Finally, determine the number of 5-star rows by dividing the number of 5-star stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of efficiency and resource management. The question involves determining the optimal number of trucks needed to transport a given number of flagstones, each weighing a specific amount, while adhering to the weight capacity of each truck.

Given:
- Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
- The total number of flagstones is 80.
- Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds.

First, we calculate the total weight of the flagstones:
\[ 80 \text{ flagstones} \times 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight, given the capacity of each truck:
\[ \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}} = 3 \text{ trucks} \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of time and motion. The question involves understanding the relationship between speed, distance, and time, which are fundamental concepts in both physics and philosophy.

Given that the car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour and covers 480 miles, we can calculate the time it takes for the car to travel this distance. The formula for time is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

The car in the slow lane travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 30 miles per hour. Using the same formula for time:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{slow}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals.

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - Ali has 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 17 medals.
   - Together, they have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals.

3. **Understand the relationship between the medals they have and the total medals given out:**
   - The problem states that the total number of medals they have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together.

4. **Calculate the total number of medals given out:**
   - If they have 39 medals together, then the total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is \(\boxed{390}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of chocolate bars available and then distribute them according to the given conditions.

1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

2. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

3. Subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

4. Distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much Susan earns, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total working time in minutes:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
   - She pauses for half an hour, so her actual working time is \(3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}\).
   - Converting 2.5 hours to minutes: \(2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Determine the number of 10-minute intervals in 150 minutes:**
   - \(150 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 15 \text{ intervals}\).

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval.
   - Therefore, her total earnings are \(15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the amount Susan earns for the online task is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"In the scenario presented, we have three friends—Mike, Jim, and Tony—who are playing a game. After three rounds, their points are as follows:

- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which means Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which means Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

In the fourth round, every player who has more than 20 points gets an extra point. Therefore:

- Mike, with 21 points, gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim, with 18 points, does not get an extra point, so his total remains 18 points.
- Tony, with 42 points, gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Adding up the final points of all three players:

- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

The total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:

83"

1. Will buys 15 oranges.
2. The oldest son, being 8 years old, will wash 8 oranges.
3. The youngest son, being half the age of the oldest son (4 years old), will wash 4 oranges.

Adding the oranges washed by both sons:
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Subtracting the washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of unwashed oranges is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total number of activities Darren has done over the two days, we need to calculate the number of each type of exercise he performed on both days and then sum them up.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he did:
- \(100 + 20 = 120\) pushups
- \(50 - 10 = 40\) squats
- \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dumbbell presses

Now, let's sum up the total number of each type of exercise over the two days:
- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these totals together gives us the overall count of activities:
\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

Therefore, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 5 \times 0.2 \, \text{kg} = 1 \, \text{kg} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 2 \, \text{kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 14 \, \text{kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and add the weekend sales:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."
"To determine the total cost of the antique desk for Carmen, we need to account for her initial bid and the subsequent increases in her bids after each of the three other bidders. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The initial bid is $200.
2. After the first other bidder, Carmen bids $200 + $50 = $250.
3. After the second other bidder, Carmen bids $250 + $50 = $300.
4. After the third other bidder, Carmen bids $300 + $50 = $350.

Now, we sum up all the bids:
\[ 200 + 250 + 300 + 350 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 200 + 250 = 450 \]
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \]
\[ 750 + 350 = 1100 \]

"To determine the annual cost John incurs for the driving service, we need to consider both the cost per mile and the monthly bonus.

1. **Daily Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, totaling 60 miles per day.

2. **Weekly Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 60 miles per day and works 5 days a week, so he drives \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles per week.

3. **Annual Miles Driven:**
   - John drives 300 miles per week and works for 50 weeks a year, so he drives \(300 \times 50 = 15000\) miles per year.

4. **Cost per Mile:**
   - John is charged $2 per mile. Therefore, the cost for the miles driven annually is \(15000 \times 2 = 30000\) dollars.

5. **Monthly Bonus:**
   - John gives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year, so the total annual bonus is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

6. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - Adding the cost for the miles driven and the annual bonus, the total annual cost is \(30000 + 1800 = 31800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for the driving service is:
```
31800

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total Books in Collection**: 250
2. **Books Remaining Unsold**: 50
3. **Books Sold This Year**: 45
4. **Price per Book**: $20
5. **Books Sold in the First Year**: Twice the number sold this year, which is \(2 \times 45 = 90\)

First, calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
\[ \text{Total Books Sold} = \text{Total Books} - \text{Books Remaining Unsold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Next, determine the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} = \text{Total Books Sold} - \text{Books Sold in the First Year} - \text{Books Sold This Year} \]
\[ \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Finally, calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money Earned in the Second Year} = \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} \times \text{Price per Book} \]
\[ \text{Money Earned in the Second Year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day for five days a week, earning $10 per hour. Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. To determine how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his weekly earnings and then multiply by the number of weeks in April.

First, calculate Watson's daily earnings:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Next, calculate his weekly earnings without the bonus:
\[ \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings with the bonus are:
\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so we calculate his total earnings for the month:
\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Thus, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of people John lost to is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. This means:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. After the morning sales, the number of loaves left is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. This means:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]
   Since these 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
   \[
   10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the rate at which Joey and Sandy lose weight. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds per week. Sandy, on the other hand, needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, Sandy will lose 8 pounds, the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks.

Given this information, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane's age is \(30 - 3 = 27\).
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent's age is \(27 + 5 = 32\).

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the given information and applying logical reasoning.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20.
   - Therefore, the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{120000}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and relationships between the different groups of players. Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the number of people who show up to Martha's party, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of people invited:**
   - Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
   - Martha also invited 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

2. **Account for the people who couldn't come:**
   - 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
   - Additionally, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.
   - Thus, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

3. **Calculate the number of people who showed up:**
   - Subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited: \(24 - 10 = 14\).

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."

The ratio provided is 1:3, indicating that for every electric pole, there are three electric wires. Given that the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required.

To solve this, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio. If the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, then for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by dividing the total number of electric wires by 3.

\[
\text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Total number of electric wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is 15."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which is 10 people. This means 30 people stayed at the party. Given that 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is \(30 - 22 = 8\).

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8.

**8**"
"The cost of the book is $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, which means the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. A pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To address the problem, we need to determine the total weakening effect of the ice cubes and the cream on Shannon's iced coffee. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and weakens it by 12 milliliters. Shannon needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, which requires:

\[
\frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

Since each ice cube weakens the coffee by 12 milliliters, 5 ice cubes will weaken the coffee by:

\[
5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Additionally, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters. Therefore, the total weakening effect is:

\[
60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the trade ratio and apply it to the number of new records received. The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means for every new record received, 2 old records are traded.

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

**14**"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps, applying principles of logical reasoning and arithmetic.

1. **Determine the Number of Junior Programmers:**
   - Given that the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees, and the total number of employees is 100, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Senior Programmers:**
   - Since the total number of employees is 100, the number of senior programmers is:
     \[
     \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the Monthly Payment to Junior Programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total payment to junior programmers is:
     \[
     \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
     \]

4. **Calculate the Monthly Payment to Senior Programmers:**
   - Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so each senior programmer is paid:
     \[
     2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total payment to senior programmers is:
     \[
     \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Monthly Payment to All Programmers:**
   - Adding the payments to junior and senior programmers gives:
     \[
     \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the sequence of events. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. Therefore, the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. This means the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."

3. He passes 14 out to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\).
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends: \(14 \times 2 = 28\). Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left: \(8 + 28 = 36\).
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\).
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\).

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone, we need to consider the rate of charging and the remaining charge needed. The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, and it currently has 60% charge. Therefore, it needs an additional 40 percentage points to reach 100%.

Given the charging rate, we can calculate the time required as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert this time into hours:

\[ 120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

**Final Answer: 2 hours**"

     \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B.

For Job A:
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the principles of division and equality. The class of 200 students is divided into three groups, with two groups being equal in number and the third being 10 students less than each of the others. This scenario can be seen as an exercise in distributive justice, where we aim to find a fair distribution of students.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Consequently, the smallest group will have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students is 200, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation, we have:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3, we find:

\[ x = 70 \]

Therefore, each of the two larger groups has 70 students, and the smallest group has:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach to logical reasoning and problem-solving.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

2. **Establish the Relationships:**
   According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows. This can be expressed as:
   \[ H = 2C \]

3. **Total Number of Animals:**
   The total number of animals is 60. This gives us the equation:
   \[ H + C = 60 \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the total number of animals equation:
   \[ 2C + C = 60 \]
   \[ 3C = 60 \]
   \[ C = 20 \]

5. **Determine the Number of Chickens:**
   Using \( C = 20 \) in the equation \( H = 2C \):
   \[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

6. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**
   Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Given the problem, we can determine the weights of each animal based on the information provided and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, the blue beetle and the green toad each weigh 50 pounds.
3. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so the yellow snake weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
4. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so the red bird weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
5. The container weighs 20 pounds.

Now, we sum the weights of the animals and the container:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of change and adaptation in training regimens. Tyson's initial training regimen of 5000 meters per day can be seen as a baseline. His coach's advice to increase his training by \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more meters introduces a principle of progressive enhancement, a concept often discussed in philosophical discussions on personal development and self-improvement.

By increasing his daily run to 6000 meters, Tyson is following a path of continuous improvement, a principle that aligns with the Stoic philosophy of living in accordance with nature and continuously striving for betterment. This approach not only enhances his physical capabilities but also embodies a broader philosophical principle of self-improvement and adaptation.

Given that June has 30 days, we can calculate the total distance Tyson would cover in June by multiplying his new daily distance by the number of days in June. Therefore, the total distance is:

\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tyson covered in June is:

\[
\boxed{180000 \text{ meters}}

"To determine the total number of legs from the tables in the restaurant, we can break down the problem into two parts: the legs from the 4-legged tables and the legs from the 3-legged tables.

First, we calculate the total number of legs from the 4-legged tables:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs from the 3-legged tables:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Finally, we add the two results together to get the total number of legs:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is:
\[

"To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.
2. Her son's lunch box gets 4 cookies each day for 5 days a week. Therefore, the total number of cookies her son eats in a week is \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
3. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats \(1 \times 7 = 7\) cookies in a week.
4. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the number of cookies eaten by her son and her husband from the total number of cookies in the bag.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 36 - (20 + 7) = 36 - 27 = 9 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on his vacation and then calculate the time he spent sightseeing, which is 40% of the total time.

First, let's calculate the time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. Therefore, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is:

1. **Initial Savings**: Annabelle already has $80 saved.
2. **Earnings from First Job**: She earns $10 per hour and works 20 hours, so her earnings are \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
3. **Earnings from Second Job**: She earns $5 per hour and works 15 hours, so her earnings are \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
4. **Total Savings**: Adding her initial savings and the earnings from both jobs, we get \(80 + 200 + 75 = 355\) dollars.
5. **Cost of the Phone**: The phone costs $400.
6. **Amount Still Needed**: Subtracting her total savings from the cost of the phone, we get \(400 - 355 = 45\) dollars.

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to first calculate the total cost for Morgan and her friends to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one person} = \$5 + \$20 = \$25
   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in one complete trip and then multiply it by the number of trips per day. The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the third city back to the first city. 

First, calculate the distance from the third city back to the first city:
\[ 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles} \]

Next, find the total distance for one complete trip:
\[ 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[ 300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day} \]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{900} = 20 \]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses for each type of gift and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Picture Frames:**
   - Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
   - An additional 20% cost for etching each frame is $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - For 44 seniors, the total cost is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of Pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of Cords:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so the number of officers is 44 * 1/4 = 11.
   - Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

4. **Total Cost:**

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's hiking speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):
\[ \text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's hiking speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Cho hiked} - \text{Distance Chloe hiked} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

   - Total number of pesos: \(150 + 200 = 350\).

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we need to follow a structured approach. First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Millie sells each cup for $1, and she can make 36 cups of lemonade. Therefore, her total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36 \]

Next, we need to account for the cost of supplies. Millie spent $18 on supplies, so her total cost is:

\[ \$18 \]

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups sold per hour:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the total time:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's consider the information given: Mr. Ruther sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, leaving him with \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his original land, which is 12.8 hectares.

Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of \( x \) is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Therefore, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of girls in the choir. Given that 50% of the choir members are girls, and the choir has 52 members, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

Number of girls = 50% of 52 = 0.5 * 52 = 26

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, the number of girls who can't make it is:

Number of girls who can't make it = 0.5 * 26 = 13

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

Number of girls who perform = 26 - 13 = 13

Additionally, 3 teachers decide to sing with them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

Total number of people who sang = Number of girls who perform + Number of teachers = 13 + 3 = 16

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles.

First, we determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Next, we calculate the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concept of cost-benefit analysis and the value of different forms of entertainment and subscription services.

Tim's decision to cancel his $60 cable package and switch to streaming services involves a trade-off between the quality and quantity of content he can access. The cable package offers a wide range of channels and content, while the streaming services provide targeted content from specific providers.

The cost of the streaming services, after a 20% discount, totals $34 per month. This is a significant reduction from the $60 cable package. The savings of $26 per month can be seen as a quantifiable benefit of Tim's decision.

From a philosophical standpoint, this scenario raises questions about the value of different forms of entertainment and the trade-offs individuals make in their lives. It also touches on the concept of utility, where the satisfaction or benefit derived from one form of entertainment might be different from another.

Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to the streaming services is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of efficiency and resource management. The question involves calculating energy savings, which can be seen as an application of practical wisdom (phronesis) in the realm of environmental ethics and sustainability.

Mel originally uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means the daily energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]
Converting to kilowatt-hours (kWh):
\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh} \]

If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new daily consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \]
Converting to kilowatt-hours:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 2.7 \, \text{kWh} \]

The daily savings in energy consumption is:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kWh} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh} \]

Over 30 days, the total savings would be:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Initial Quantities:**
   - Allan has 40 cannolis.
   - Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, he has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.

2. **Changes in Quantities:**
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the new total of cannolis is \(40 + 60 = 100\).
   - He buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he bought, which is \(60 - 40 = 20\) fewer corns. Therefore, the new total of corns is \(80 - 20 = 60\).

3. **Combined Total:**
   - The new total number of cannolis is 100.
   - The new total number of corns is 60.
   - The combined total is \(100 + 60 = 160\).

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time required for him to read the book and then account for the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, let's calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine the time it takes for Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After finishing the book, Toby needs an additional 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time from the start of reading until he leaves for the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, the number of minutes early he will be is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we need to consider the logical relationships and probabilities involved. The key points are the guarantees provided and the specific defects in the candles.

Given:
- Marcy markets her candles as 99% guaranteed not to explode.
- 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- Total number of candles = 50,000.

First, let's determine the number of candles that will explode. Since the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, 1% of the candles will explode:
\[ 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. The problem states that 5% of the more dangerous candles (which we can assume are the ones that might explode) have this defect. Therefore, we calculate 5% of the 500 exploding candles:
\[ 5\% \times 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price. 

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of the scenario and the relationships between the quantities involved.

1. **Joanne's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: Half of 30, which is 15 apples.
   - From the average trees: Let's denote this as \(x\).

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is \(30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\).

2. **Sister's Apples:**
   - From the tallest trees: Twice as many as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: Three times as many as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples her sister gathers is \(60 + 45 = 105\).

3. **Combined Total:**
   - The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500.

   So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (45 + x) + 105 = 500
   \]

4. **Solving for \(x\):**
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

Therefore, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations, a fundamental concept in philosophy and mathematics that helps us understand and model relationships between different quantities.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

3. **Next Day:**
   - Tom did not travel at all.
   - Distance for the next day: \(0 \text{ km}\).

4. **Second Week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week: \(300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}\).

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{3140}\) kilometers."
"To determine the size of Timothy's locker, we need to work through the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
2. Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, to find the size of Zack's locker, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
3. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. Therefore, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2:
   \[
   \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we need to consider the difference in elevation between where Oliver is standing and where the comb is located.

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 6,000 feet (10,000 feet - 4,000 feet), and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation between Oliver's position and the comb's position is:

\[ 6,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 3,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb.

The correct answer is: 3,000 feet."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concept of resources and their accumulation. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. He then received additional funds from two banks: $4000 from the first bank and twice that amount, which is $8000, from the second bank. By adding these amounts together, we can determine his total capital.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Initial capital: $5000
2. Amount from the first bank: $4000
3. Amount from the second bank: $8000 (twice the amount from the first bank)

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Josue now has a total capital of:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which totals to 20 cats. Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we have:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. This means:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 that were left, we get:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing structure provided.

1. **First 6 months at $8 a month:**
   \[
   6 \text{ months} \times \$8/\text{month} = \$48
   \]

2. **Next 8 months at $12 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$12/\text{month} = \$96
   \]

3. **The remaining 8 months at $14 a month:**
   \[
   8 \text{ months} \times \$14/\text{month} = \$112
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[
\$48 + \$96 + \$112 = \$256
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is:
\[
\boxed{256}
\]"
"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we need to analyze the scenario through the lens of cost, value, and decision-making. The core of the question revolves around the original prices of the jeans and the savings Cole made.

Given:
- Tattered jeans cost $28.
- Jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which means they originally cost $22.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

From the information, we can deduce:
- Savings from jogger jeans: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
- Savings from tattered jeans: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

The original price of the jogger jeans is $22, and the original price of the tattered jeans is $28. The difference in their original prices is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the combined capacity of the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

1. **Buses**: There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
   \[
   4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Minibusses**: There are 6 minibusses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
   \[
   6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Minivans**: There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
   \[
   10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

Adding these capacities together gives us the total number of employees that can join the day trip:
\[
240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ employees}
\]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[
570
\]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of expectations and the reliability of observations. Lillian's garden, with its newly added bird feeders, presents an interesting scenario for understanding how our expectations and observations can influence our understanding of reality.

Lillian builds and buys bird feeders, each of which attracts a certain number of birds. Initially, each bird feeder attracts 20 birds. However, Lillian notices that the homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. This observation suggests a difference in the attractiveness of the feeders, which can be attributed to various factors such as the materials used, the design, or even the scent.

Given this information, we can calculate the total number of birds expected in Lillian's garden each day. Each homemade feeder attracts 30 birds, and each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds. Lillian has 3 of each type of feeder.

The total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

The total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of birds expected in Lillian's garden each day:
\[ 90 + 60 = 150 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The cost of the bagel is given as $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the soup is:
   \[
   4 + (0.25 \times 4) = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Therefore, the cost of the cake is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the dinner:
\[
4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

Thus, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of justice and fairness in resource distribution. The caterer initially prepared enough hotdogs to ensure that half of the guests (18 out of 36) could have two hotdogs each, while the other half (18 guests) would have one hotdog each. This initial distribution was based on an expected number of guests (36).

However, when 40 guests showed up, the situation changed. The caterer had prepared 54 hotdogs, which were sufficient for the first 18 guests to have two hotdogs each and the remaining 18 guests to have one hotdog each. But with 22 additional guests wanting a second hotdog, the total demand for hotdogs exceeded the supply.

From a philosophical standpoint, we can consider the principle of need and fairness. The 22 additional guests, who arrived unexpectedly, also have a legitimate need for a second hotdog. Given the limited supply, it is not possible to satisfy everyone's second hotdog request. 

To determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog, we need to account for the shortfall. The caterer had 54 hotdogs, and the 18 guests who were initially supposed to have two hotdogs each consumed 36 hotdogs. The remaining 18 guests consumed 18 hotdogs, leaving 54 - 36 - 18 = 0 hotdogs for the additional 22 guests. Since these 22 guests each wanted one additional hotdog, and there were no hotdogs left, 4 of these 22 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of letters in Indras' name**: Indras' name has 6 letters.
2. **Calculate half of the letters in Indras' name**: Half of 6 is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).
3. **Find the number of letters in her sister's name**: Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so \( 3 + 4 = 7 \).
4. **Calculate the total number of letters in both names**: Add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name, which is \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the individual costs:**
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils: 5 at $5.00 each, so \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars

2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   \[
   120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - A 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the total cost.
   - Calculate 80% of $165:
   \[
   165 \times 0.80 = 132 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is \(\boxed{132}\)."
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wishes to purchase. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these amounts together, we get:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost is $19.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora currently has. She has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. Adding these amounts together, we get:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora has $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Prince Thaddeus**: Slew 100 dragons.
2. **Prince Arthur**: Slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. **Prince Walter**: Slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. **Prince Bruce**: Slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed. Josey required \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, so we calculate the amount of gas she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

To convert gallons to pints, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon equals 8 pints. Therefore, we convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints per gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, the amount of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6 \text{ pints}} \]"

1. **Determine the total amount spent on chips:**
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Each bag of chips costs 40 cents.
   - Total cost for chips: \(3 \times 0.40 = 1.20\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the remaining money after buying chips:**
   - George initially had $5.
   - He spent $1.20 on chips.
   - Remaining money: \(5 - 1.20 = 3.80\) dollars.

3. **Determine the amount of money left after all purchases:**
   - George had 1% of his initial $5 left.
   - 1% of $5 is \(0.05\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on candy bars:**
   - Total spent: $4.95 (since $5 - $0.05 = $4.95).
   - Amount spent on chips: $1.20.
   - Amount spent on candy bars: \(4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75\) dollars.

5. **Determine the number of candy bars bought:**

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many lollipops each of Ray's four friends received after he shared the remaining lollipops equally among them.

First, we calculate the number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends. Ray originally had 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. Therefore, the number of lollipops he shared is:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Next, we need to divide these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. So, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

Thus, each of Ray's friends received \(\boxed{5}\) lollipops."
"The cake initially weighs 20 ounces and is divided into 8 equal pieces. Each piece therefore weighs:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \]

Rory and her mom each take one piece, consuming a total of 2 pieces. The weight of the consumed pieces is:

\[ 2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Subtracting the weight of the consumed pieces from the original weight of the cake gives the remaining weight:

\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces."
"To solve the problem of how many oranges each person will get, we first need to determine the total number of oranges and the total number of people sharing them.

Sitti and Juris together have:
\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \text{ oranges} \]

They are sharing these oranges with their 6 other friends, making the total number of people:
\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of onions needed:**
   - The original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine doubles the recipe, so he needs \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.

2. **Calculate the cost of the onions:**
   - The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound.
   - Therefore, the cost for 4 pounds of onions is \(4 \times 2 = \$8.00\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the beef stock:**
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.
   - Each box costs $2.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 boxes of beef stock is \(2 \times 2 = \$4.00\).

4. **Calculate the total cost of the ingredients:**
   - The total cost is the sum of the cost of the onions and the beef stock.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(8 + 4 = \$12.00\).

5. **Calculate the cost per serving:**
   - The soup serves 6 people.
   - Therefore, the cost per serving is \(\frac{12}{6} = \$2.00\).

Thus, the cost per serving is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the timing and travel durations for both Wayne and Bernadette. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Wayne's Travel Time**: Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.
2. **Bernadette's Travel Time**: Bernadette's travel time is four times that of Wayne's, which is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater, Bernadette needs to be there 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival time. This means Bernadette needs to be at the theater 9 minutes before Wayne (4 minutes for Wayne's travel + 5 minutes before Wayne's arrival).

Given that Bernadette's travel time is 16 minutes, she needs to leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure she arrives 9 minutes before Wayne's arrival time.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to first convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Given that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can solve for the width:

\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack} + 2 \text{ packs} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs} + 4 \text{ packs} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of beads:
\[ 140 \text{ pieces} - 60 \text{ pieces} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the time taken by Jon and then determine the time taken by James for each segment of the triathlon.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine the time James took for each segment:
- Swim: James finishes 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

- Bike ride: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. The total time for James is the sum of the times for the swim, bike ride, and run:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert the length of Movie C to minutes:**
   - Movie C is given as 1.25 hours.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, 1.25 hours = \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.

2. **Determine the length of Movie B:**
   - Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
   - Therefore, the length of Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.

3. **Calculate the length of Movie A:**
   - Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B.
   - Therefore, the length of Movie A = \(\frac{80}{4} = 20\) minutes.

Thus, the length of Movie A is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance covered is:
     \[
     32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   - The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs.
   - For 16 miles, the hay consumption is:
     \[
     16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - The total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
     \[
     8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the amount of money Michael has and the change he receives:**
   - Michael has six $5 bills, which amounts to:
     \[
     6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}

The regular price of the popcorn is $4."
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the initial cost per balloon. Given that 20 balloons cost $900, the cost per balloon is:

\[ \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Two days later, the cost per balloon increased by $20, making the new cost per balloon:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon} \]

Bentley then filled 170 balloons at this new price. The total cost for 170 balloons is:

\[ 170 \times 65 = 11050 \]

Therefore, the amount Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons is:

\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To determine the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance traveled at each speed:
- At 60 mph for 2 hours, the distance is \(60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}\).
- At 30 mph for 1 hour, the distance is \(30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}\).

Next, we find the total distance traveled:
\[120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}.\]

Now, we calculate the total time taken:
\[2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}.\]

Finally, we determine the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[\frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}.\]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is \(\boxed{50}\) mph."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, and each ruby is worth $1200. 

First, calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has after the trade:
- Jenna initially has 8 sapphires.
- After trading 3 sapphires, she has \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires.
- The value of these 5 sapphires is \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.

Next, calculate the value of the rubies:
- Jenna receives 2 rubies in the trade.
- The value of these 2 rubies is \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

Finally, add the value of the sapphires and rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
- Total value = value of sapphires + value of rubies
- Total value = \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of apples Marin and Nancy consume in 30 days, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the daily consumption for each individual.
2. Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days.
3. Sum the total consumption for both individuals.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. Over 30 days, the total consumption for each is:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Since both Marin and Nancy have the same daily consumption, the combined total is:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we first need to calculate the total volume of soil required for all the raised beds. Each raised bed has dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of card. We know there are 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. Therefore, we calculate the number of green cards as follows:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we determine the number of yellow cards. The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Finally, we find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

\[ \text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Thus, the total number of cards is \(\boxed{78}\)."

"To determine the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we first need to calculate the total number of puppies and the total number of puppies with spots.

Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

The total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

The total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35\%} \]"
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we first calculate the total weight of all the feed.

1. **Hay**: 
   - 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

2. **Oats**: 
   - 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

3. **Carrots**: 
   - 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

4. **Sugar cubes**: 
   - 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

Summing up the total weight of all the feed:
\[3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4490 \text{ pounds}\]

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity and round up to the nearest whole number:

Rounding up, we get 3 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{3}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Grayson recycles cans and bottles for money each week. An aluminum can is worth two cents, and a plastic bottle is worth three cents. She drinks three aluminum cans of soda and five plastic bottles of water a week. To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from aluminum cans = \(3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week}\).

2. Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Weekly earnings from plastic bottles = \(5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week}\).

3. Calculate the total weekly earnings from both cans and bottles:
   - Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week}\).

4. Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month:
   - Total earnings for four weeks = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we start by converting the length of the remoras from inches to feet. Since 6 inches is equivalent to 0.5 feet, and there are 2 remoras, the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 0.5 \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:

- \( D \) is the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) is the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) is:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to consider both the employees and the tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:

"To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to consider both the plane tickets and the hotel expenses.

1. **Plane Tickets**: Each ticket costs $5000, and since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
   \[
   5000 \times 2 = 10000
   \]

2. **Hotel Cost**: The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. Since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. Therefore, the increased cost per day is:
   \[
   1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800
   \]
   For a 3-day stay, the total hotel cost is:
   \[
   1800 \times 3 = 5400
   \]

3. **Total Trip Cost**: Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel gives us the total cost of the trip:

"To determine the combined weight of the two pennies, we start by noting the weight of the 1959 penny, which is 48 grains. The 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. Therefore, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Next, we add the weights of both pennies to find the combined weight:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

Thus, the combined weight of the two pennies is:

\[
\boxed{84}

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discounts, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett is currently 14, three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela's current age is 38.**"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the total cost for both his morning and afternoon rides.

For the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

For the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- Paul drives in the afternoon every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for afternoon rides is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total expenditure:
- Total cost = Cost for morning rides + Cost for afternoon rides
- Total cost = \(84 + 28 = 112\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{112}\)."

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally cost-effective, we can set up an equation based on the given costs.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

For the first venue, the total cost is the sum of the flat fee and the cost of food:
\[ \text{Total cost for the first venue} = 200 + 5x \]

For the second venue, the total cost is simply the cost per guest, as food is included:
\[ \text{Total cost for the second venue} = 25x \]

To find the number of guests at which the costs are equal, we set the two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 200 = 25x - 5x \]
\[ 200 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's define the number of insects David found as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by calculating the amount each used individually.

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein, so the amount her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total yards of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}

   \[
   3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the length of the couch**: The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Since the width of the rug is 8 feet, twice the width of the rug is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:
   \[
   16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Identify the total cost and the known quantities:**
   - Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
   - She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
   - She bought 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
   - She bought 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so $1.
   - The total cost for all the gum is $7.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let the cost of each pack of strawberry gum be \( x \).
   - The total cost can be expressed as: \( 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \).

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine the known costs: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \).
   - So, the equation simplifies to: \( 2x + 3 = 7 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: \( 2x = 4 \).
   - Divide both sides by 2: \( x = 2 \).

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum costs \( \boxed{2} \) dollars."
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost-effectiveness of the wood pieces he can buy. Each 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks, while each 2 x 8 piece costs $6 and provides 400 sticks. Given Frederick has $24 to spend, we should calculate how many sticks he can get from the cheapest option, which is the 2 x 4 piece of wood.

First, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, so with 6 pieces, Frederick can get:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Since the 2 x 8 piece is more expensive and provides fewer sticks per dollar, it is not the most cost-effective option. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To determine the cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Legs**: Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Pairs of Snowshoes Needed**: Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs required is:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Cost**: Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has 20 sheep.
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo must have \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. Since the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm must have \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:

- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Initial Calculation of Total Money:**
   Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount of money Ali has is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160
   \]

2. **Giving Half to Sister:**
   Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. Therefore, the amount given to his sister is:
   \[
   \frac{160}{2} = 80
   \]
   After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
   \[
   160 - 80 = 80
   \]

3. **Spending on Dinner:**
   Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48
   \]
   After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
   \[
   80 - 48 = 32
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step. First, we convert Rob's time into minutes. Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Royce to shingle a house. The problem states that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes. Adding 40 minutes to this gives us \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, the time it takes Royce to shingle a house is 280 minutes.

\(\boxed{280}\)"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the wool required for one set of winter wear for a single grandchild. The items and their respective wool requirements are as follows:

- Hat: 2 skeins
- Scarf: 4 skeins
- Sweater: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Adding these together gives the total for one set:
\[ 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 \text{ skeins} \]

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one set by 3:
\[ 21 \times 3 = 63 \text{ skeins} \]

Therefore, the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need to buy is \(\boxed{63}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach of analyzing the given information and deducing the logical conclusion.

1. Chris starts with 100 math problems.
2. On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
   - Remaining problems: \(100 - 12 = 88\)
3. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
   - Problems completed on Tuesday: \(3 \times 12 = 36\)
   - Remaining problems: \(88 - 36 = 52\)
4. On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems.
   - Problems completed on Wednesday: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13\)
   - Remaining problems: \(52 - 13 = 39\)

Thus, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is \(\boxed{39}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break down the strawberry-picking rates for each individual:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum up the picking rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."
"To determine the number of loaves of bread left, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the total number of loaves baked: 200.

3. Subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon: 107 - 39 = 68.
4. Add the unsold loaves returned by the grocery store: 68 + 6 = 74.

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread left is \(\boxed{74}\)."
"To determine the number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to consider the constraints given for each type of tulip and the total number of tulips he has.

1. **Red Tulips:**
   - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
   - He has 36 red tulips.
   - Therefore, the number of rows for the red tulips is \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

2. **Blue Tulips:**
   - Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.
   - He has 24 blue tulips.
   - Therefore, the number of rows for the blue tulips is \( \frac{24}{8} = 3 \).

3. **Total Rows:**
   - Adding the rows for red and blue tulips, we get \( 6 + 3 = 9 \).

Thus, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Divide the total amount of raisins equally among the three uses (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix):**
   \[
   \text{Raisins per use} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per use}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with 9 cups of raisins:**
   \[
   \text{Number of batches} = \frac{9 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cups per batch}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12

Therefore, the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of utility and the impact of individual actions on overall well-being. In this scenario, Ada's decision to add a new device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour daily will affect her weekly electric bill.

Before adding the device, Ada's weekly electric bill is calculated as follows:
- Daily consumption: 12 kWh * 24 hours = 288 kWh
- Weekly consumption: 288 kWh * 7 days = 2016 kWh
- Weekly cost: 2016 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3024

After adding the device, her weekly electric bill changes to:
- Additional daily consumption: 2 kWh * 24 hours = 48 kWh
- New daily consumption: 288 kWh + 48 kWh = 336 kWh
- New weekly consumption: 336 kWh * 7 days = 2352 kWh
- New weekly cost: 2352 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $3528

The difference in her weekly electric bill is:
- $3528 - $3024 = $504

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{504} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's first determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house. This means the rate for one person is:

\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:

\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships and quantities given.

1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**

   - Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of chairs Ophelia has is \(20 + 2 = 22\).

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Therefore, the number of chairs Jenna has is \(3 \times 22 = 66\).

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of sofas Jenna has is \(66 - 2 = 64\).

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total number of sofas: \(20 + 64 = 84\).
   - Total number of chairs: \(22 + 66 = 88\).
   - Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs is \(84 + 88 = 172\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{172}\)."

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the specific weeks where he worked out for more than 4 hours.

Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for two consecutive weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each, and one week where he worked out for 6 hours.

First, calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of passengers on the bus at each stop.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers}
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers}
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers}
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66 \text{ passengers}
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach of analyzing the given information and deducing the necessary conclusions.

1. **Determine Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, Jame's current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Determine Jame's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

3. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, Jame's cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) in 8 years.

4. **Determine Jame's Cousin's Current Age:**
   - Since Jame's cousin will be 55 in 8 years, his current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\).

5. **Calculate the Age Difference:**
   - The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, we determine the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of the printer} = \text{Cost of the computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:
\[ \text{Total cost of computer and printer} = 1100 + 700 = 1800 \]

Now, we find the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = 2400 - 1800 = 600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:
\[ \text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"In the scenario presented, twenty kids were divided into two equal groups of ten for a scavenger hunt. The boys each brought back 60 seashells. The girls brought an amount that is the sum of the number of seashells the boys brought plus four times that amount. 

To find the number of seashells each girl brought, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Seashells brought by each girl} = 60 + 4 \times 60 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ \text{Seashells brought by each girl} = 60 + 240 = 300 \]

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.

The final answer is:
\[ 300 \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, drawing from a philosophical approach to understanding relationships and quantities.

Initially, we are told that Nick had twice as many candies as George. Let's denote the number of candies George originally had as \( G \). Therefore, Nick had \( 2G \) candies.

Next, we are informed that George ate 5 candies and now has 3 candies left. This means that before eating the 5 candies, George had:

\[ G = 3 + 5 = 8 \]

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George originally, we can now calculate the number of candies Nick had:

\[ 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of candies Nick has is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, who is 10 years old. Therefore, Alyana is \(10 - 4 = 6\) years old. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is \(6 + 2 = 8\) years old.

The correct answer is: Anne is 8 years old."
"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To determine how many vlogs Emma should make in the fourth week to meet her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first need to calculate the total number of vlogs she has already produced in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:
\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma should make \(\boxed{18}\) vlogs in the fourth week to complete her goal of 72 vlogs per month."
"To determine how much you end up paying, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total bill including the tip:**
   - The original bill is $50.
   - The tip is 20% of $50.
   - Tip amount = 20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10.
   - Total bill including tip = $50 + $10 = $60.

2. **Determine how the bill is split:**
   - Since the bill is to be split evenly, each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays = $60 / 2 = $30.

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach to understanding the sequence of events and their implications.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - The total amount of $18 is divided equally among 3 boys. Each boy initially receives:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of rational planning and the distribution of resources over time. Elvis has a monthly savings target of $1125 and wants to achieve this by saving more in the second half of the month compared to the first half.

Let's break down the month of April, which has 30 days, into two equal halves, each consisting of 15 days. We can denote the daily savings in the first half as \( x \). Consequently, the daily savings in the second half would be \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of the month would be \( 15x \), and for the second half, it would be \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \). Therefore, the total savings for the month can be expressed as:

\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Given that Elvis's target is $1125, we can set up the equation:

\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Thus, the daily savings in the first half of the month is $25. Consequently, the daily savings in the second half of the month, which is twice the first half, would be:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."
"To determine the change Verna received, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought. 

- The cost of three apples at $1.50 each is \(3 \times 1.50 = 4.50\).
- The cost of five oranges at $0.80 each is \(5 \times 0.80 = 4.00\).
- The cost of six peaches at $0.75 each is \(6 \times 0.75 = 4.50\).

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits:
\[4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00\]

Verna gave $20, so the change she received is:
\[20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\]

Therefore, the change Verna received is \(\$7.00\)."

"To solve the problem of how much Jeff gets when dividing 100 dollars with Brad, where Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can set up an equation based on the given conditions.

Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \).

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."
"Jeff walks to and from work each day, covering a total of 6 miles per day (3 miles to work and 3 miles back). If he works 5 days a week, the total distance he walks in a week is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Determine the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan's play set needs to be five times larger, we calculate:
   \[
   5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

2. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. Let \( x \) represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

3. Solve for \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2

   x = 398
   \]

Thus, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"To determine how much Daniel has to spend on the items he wants to buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before any discount is applied. The items and their respective costs are as follows:

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

\[ 140 \text{ bottles needed} - 48 \text{ bottles available} = 92 \text{ additional bottles needed} \]

Therefore, the number of additional bottles of water Bill will need to buy is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference in time between the two conditions.

First, let's establish the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in cold water:
- Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water:
- In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes in cold water.
- Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to this gives \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes for a mile in warm water.

Now, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition:
- In cold water: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
- The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day."
"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Daily Earnings Calculation:**
   John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day.
   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day}

"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of moderation and the balance between health and personal choice. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended 4 cups of coffee, which is 2 cups daily. Juan, on the other hand, drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, which is 20 cups daily. His doctor recommends he reduce his intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

From a philosophical standpoint, the question of how much coffee Juan should consume can be seen as a balance between personal preference and health recommendations. The reduction needed is the difference between his current intake and the recommended amount. Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by:

\[ 20 \text{ cups} - 4 \text{ cups} = 16 \text{ cups} \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of pages Judy read over two weeks. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the total reading time in the first week. Judy read for 15 minutes each night, and there are 7 nights in a week. Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages Judy read in the first week. We know that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find her reading rate in pages per minute, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can determine the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote Shiloh's current age as \( S \) and his nephew's current age as \( N \). We know that Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \). At that time, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be expressed as:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

Final answer: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we can break down the payments as follows:

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and apply logical reasoning, much like one would in philosophical analysis.

First, let's determine how much Peter spends each day. He has $70 to spend over 7 days, so he spends:

\[ \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day} \]

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spends 4 days, so the total amount spent on wooden action figures is:

\[ 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each wooden action figure costs $5, the number of wooden action figures he buys is:

\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ wooden action figures} \]

After Wednesday, he has:

\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ dollars left} \]

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. The number of plastic action figures he can buy is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ plastic action figures} \]

Therefore, the total number of action figures he will have by the end of the week is:

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we need to consider the nature of measurement and the reliability of instruments. Maggie's oven, being malfunctioning, introduces a consistent error in temperature readings. The question asks us to determine the setting for a desired temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is 4% too hot when set to 450 degrees.

First, let's understand the error. If the oven is 4% too hot, it means that when set to 450 degrees, it actually reaches 468 degrees. This can be expressed as:

\[ 450 \times 1.04 = 468 \]

To find the correct setting for 520 degrees, we need to reverse this process. We need to find a temperature \( T \) such that when the oven is set to \( T \), it reaches 520 degrees. This can be expressed as:

\[ T \times 1.04 = 520 \]

Solving for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so her total hours are:
  \[
  2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]

- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is:
  \[
  2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]
- John also worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is:
  \[
  3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Therefore, John's total hours are:
  \[
  4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours}
  \]

Next, we calculate the earnings for each individual at the rate of $10 per hour:

- Jill's earnings are:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- John's earnings are:
  \[
  7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we find the difference in earnings between John and Jill:

\[
70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, burning 500 calories per hour, and 1 hour running, burning 600 calories per hour. 

The total calories burned from aerobics is:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories} \]

The total calories burned from running is:
\[ 1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories} \]

Adding these together gives the total calories burned:
\[ 1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories} \]

Given that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we calculate the amount of water needed as follows:
\[ \frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml} \]

Therefore, the amount of water Hannah needs to drink is:
\[ \boxed{800 \, \text{ml}} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's consider the relationships between the quantities of jelly beans and use algebra to find the solution.

Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jelly beans. According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as:
\[ R = 0.99B \]
\[ G = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."
"To determine the average of Jared's three typing speeds, we first need to identify the three speeds:

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after lessons: 52 WPM
3. Speed after another increase: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM

Next, we calculate the sum of these speeds:

\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

To find the average, we divide the sum by the number of measurements, which is 3:

\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is:

\[

"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we can follow a straightforward calculation based on the given weekly weight changes.

1. **Weekly Weight Change:**
   - Eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week
   - Eating Donuts: +1.75 pounds/week

2. **Total Weight Change Over 5 Weeks:**
   - Eating Cheerios: -1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = -6.25 pounds
   - Eating Donuts: +1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = +8.75 pounds

3. **Difference in Weight Change:**
   - Difference: 8.75 pounds - (-6.25 pounds) = 8.75 pounds + 6.25 pounds = 15 pounds

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is 15 pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex will need, we must consider all the individuals who will be attending the event. Let's break it down:

1. **Email Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   - Each of these 100 people will invite 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people invited by email is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Phone Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of additional people from phone invitations is \(8\) (the friends) + \(8\) (their spouses) = \(16\).

3. **Total Number of People:**
   - The total number of people attending the event is the sum of the initial 100 people, the 200 additional people invited by email, and the 16 additional people from phone invitations.
   - Total = \(100 + 200 + 16 = 316\).

Therefore, the correct number of seats Alex will need is \(\boxed{316}\)."
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
   \[
   \text{Dachshund's weight} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   \text{Papillon's weight} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
   \[
   \text{Mastiff's weight} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs \(\boxed{220}\) pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

For Amazon:
- Boot cost: $16
- Shipping cost: $4
- Total cost: $16 + $4 = $20

For eBay:
- Boot cost: $13
- Shipping cost: Twice the Amazon shipping cost, so $4 * 2 = $8
- Total cost: $13 + $8 = $21

The difference in cost between eBay and Amazon is:
- $21 (eBay) - $20 (Amazon) = $1

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay."
"To solve the problem of how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the nature of growth and doubling.

Let's break down the growth of the beanstalk:

- **Day 0**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet.
- **Day 1**: The beanstalk doubles to 8 feet.
- **Day 2**: The beanstalk doubles to 16 feet.
- **Day 3**: The beanstalk doubles to 32 feet.

From a philosophical standpoint, we can see that the beanstalk's growth is an example of exponential growth, which is a fundamental concept in understanding the nature of change and transformation. Each day, the beanstalk's height is not just an incremental increase but a doubling, reflecting a rapid and transformative process.

To determine when the beanstalk exceeds the height of the window, we observe that on Day 2, the beanstalk is 16 feet tall, which is still below the 20 feet of the window. However, on Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, surpassing the height of the window.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many grams of protein John consumes per week from eating mushrooms, we can break down the problem into a few logical steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - A cup of mushrooms (100 grams) contains 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is \( \frac{3 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} = 0.03 \text{ grams per gram} \).

2. **Calculate the daily protein intake:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - The daily protein intake is \( 200 \text{ grams} \times 0.03 \text{ grams per gram} = 6 \text{ grams} \).

3. **Calculate the weekly protein intake:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The weekly protein intake is \( 6 \text{ grams per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams} \).

Therefore, John gets \(\boxed{42}\) grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms."
"To solve the problem, let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the remaining cost of his dental work, we first calculate the total cost of the dental work and then subtract the deposit he has already paid. The base cost for two implants is $2000 each, totaling $4000. Adding the extra $500 for the porcelain crown brings the total to $4500. Since George has already paid a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900. Given that George earns $15 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is $3900 / $15 = 260 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is 260 hours."
"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \(3x\).

We can set up the equation for the sum of the angles in the triangle:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle in the triangle is therefore 90 degrees.

The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to convert all his coins into their equivalent value in nickels, since each gumball costs one nickel.

First, let's convert each type of coin:
- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equivalent to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equivalent to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equivalent to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equivalent to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels remain as 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equivalent to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equivalent to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, let's add up all the nickels:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**
69"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the plane and then use that speed to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

First, let's calculate the speed of the plane. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. Therefore, the speed of the plane is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

we substitute the distance and speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel 2000 miles.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of productivity and time management, which aligns with philosophical concepts of efficiency and resource allocation.

1. **Determine Ruiz's Production Rate:**
   - Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.
   - Therefore, Ruiz's hourly production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Marissa's Production Rate:**
   - Marissa produces \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Ruiz produces in an hour.
   - Ruiz produces 60 pounds per hour, so Marissa's hourly production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Production in 12 Hours:**
   - Ruiz works for 12 hours, so his total production is:
     \[
     60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Marissa also works for 12 hours, so her total production is:
     \[
     45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate Combined Total Production:**
   - Adding Ruiz's and Marissa's total production gives:
     \[
     720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we can break down the problem into two parts based on the different rates and durations of sales.

First, let's calculate the earnings for the initial four hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups per hour at $0.50 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
- Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

Next, let's calculate the earnings for the subsequent two hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups per hour at $0.60 per cup.
- Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
- Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Adding the earnings from both periods gives us the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is $42."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}

     \]

Therefore, the tire needs to be replaced in \(\boxed{6}\) years."
"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. **Total Washings per Bottle**: The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.
2. **Washings per Pump**: Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
   \[
   \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
   \]
3. **Cost per Washing**: The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
   \[
   \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
   \]
4. **Cost per Pump**: Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
   \]
5. **Convert to Cents**: Since 1 dollar equals 100 cents:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents}

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the situation from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the principles of practical reasoning and the constraints of Joe's budget.

Joe has $50 to spend on an outfit for his field trip. The clothing store is offering a 30% discount on the shirt he wants, which originally costs $25. The shorts he wants to buy cost $35 and do not have a discount.

First, we calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
\[ \text{Discounted price of the shirt} = 25 - (25 \times 0.30) = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, we add the cost of the shorts:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Joe has $50, and the total cost of the items is $52.50. Since $50 is less than $52.50, Joe does not have enough money to make the purchase.

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

This scenario raises questions about the importance of budgeting and the consequences of making purchases beyond one's means. It also highlights the need for practical reasoning in decision-making."
"To address Juan's need for butter to make croissants, we can break down the problem philosophically by focusing on the essence of the question and the logical steps required to solve it.

First, we need to understand the relationship between the number of croissants and the amount of butter required. The problem states that 1/4 pound of butter is needed to make 1 dozen croissants. This establishes a direct proportion between the number of dozens of croissants and the amount of butter required.

Next, we need to determine the total number of dozens of croissants Juan plans to make in a week. He wants to make 4 dozen croissants each day for 7 days. Therefore, the total number of dozens of croissants is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen} \]

Given that 1/4 pound of butter is needed for each dozen croissants, the total amount of butter required for 28 dozen croissants is:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of butter Juan will need is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to calculate the cost for each street and then find the difference.

1. **Cost to repave Monica's street:**

   - Total cost for Monica's street = 150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

2. **Cost to repave Lewis' street:**
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = 490 meters * $194/meter = $95,060

3. **Difference in cost:**
   - Difference in cost = Cost of Lewis' street - Cost of Monica's street
   - Difference in cost = $95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

Therefore, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is \(\boxed{65960}\)."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the expenses into two periods: the initial 5 months and the subsequent 5 months.

1. **Initial 5 Months:**
   - John receives an initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\).

2. **Subsequent 5 Months:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, so the total duration is 50 months.
   - The first 5 months are covered, leaving 45 months.
   - The cost for each of these 5 months is 50% more than the initial funding.
   - Increased funding per month: \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - Total cost for the subsequent 5 months: \(150,000 \times 5 = 750,000\).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Sum of the costs for both periods: \(500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\).

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total Meat from the Bull**: The bull weighs 750 kg.
2. **Daily Sales**: Prince sells 15 kg of meat per hour and works 10 hours a day. Therefore, his daily sales are:
   \[
   15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]
3. **Calculation of Days Needed**: To find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat, we divide the total meat by the daily sales:
   \[
   \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days}
   \]

Thus, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Initial Condition**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. **Gum Consumption at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he is at school. Since the school day is 8 hours long, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Therefore, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. **Gum Consumption on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow a series of logical steps grounded in the principles of unit conversion and philosophical reasoning about measurement.

First, we recognize that Ashley's internet speed is given in kilobytes per second (kb/s). We need to convert this to megabytes per hour (Mb/h).

1. **Convert kb/s to Mb/s:**
   - We know that 1 megabyte (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobytes (kb).
   - Therefore, to convert from kb/s to Mb/s, we divide by 1000.
   \[
   20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s}
   \]

2. **Convert Mb/s to Mb/h:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in one hour.
   - To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600.
   \[
   0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h}
   \]

Thus, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"To solve the problem of calculating the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break it down into a few clear steps:

1. **First Three Days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Remaining Four Days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}
     \]
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Total Number of Cars Towed in the Week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days:
     \[
     30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow a structured approach, considering the principles of ethical business practices and the distribution of profits in a sales scenario.

1. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Determine the Total Cost to Acquire the Cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
   \[
   \text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500

   \]

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's Commission on the Profit:**
   James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500

     25 \times 0.40 = 10
     \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"In the context of the given problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective by considering the relationships and values inherent in the items being priced. The problem involves understanding the interdependence of values and how one item's value affects the others.

Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) of the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
\]

Next, we determine the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Finally, we sum the prices of all three jewels to find the total:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. **Rose Stamps**: Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Now, we sum up all the stamps:
\[
16 + 19 + 10 = 45
\]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to consider the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is 15 miles per hour, meaning Tom is closing the 75-mile gap at this rate.

Using the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to set up an inequality based on the given information.

1. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60.
2. There are 10 total classes.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss.

If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he will attend \( 10 - x \) classes. The cost per class is then given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum value of \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve this inequality, we first multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, reversing the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the productivity rates of Julie and Jewel and then calculate their combined weekly output.

Given:
- Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
- Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel daily.

First, we calculate Julie's daily customer processing rate:
\[ \text{Julie's daily rate} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers} \]

Next, we find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions.

First, we calculate the amount of flour in one bag. The problem states that one bag is divided into 8 portions, each weighing 2 kilograms. Therefore, the total amount of flour in one bag is:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of flour in three bags. Since each bag contains 16 kilograms of flour, the total amount of flour in three bags is:

\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

Thus, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:

\[
\boxed{48}

"To determine the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley, we can break down the problem into simpler steps.

First, we calculate the distance Alisa biked:
- Alisa's speed: 12 miles per hour
- Alisa's time: 4.5 hours
- Distance biked by Alisa = Speed × Time = 12 miles/hour × 4.5 hours = 54 miles

Next, we calculate the distance Stanley biked:
- Stanley's speed: 10 miles per hour
- Stanley's time: 2.5 hours
- Distance biked by Stanley = Speed × Time = 10 miles/hour × 2.5 hours = 25 miles

Finally, we add the distances together to find the total miles biked:
- Total distance = Distance biked by Alisa + Distance biked by Stanley = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles

Therefore, the total miles biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the time required to dig through the soil and the time required to dig through the clay.

1. **Time to dig through the soil:**
   - Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - The time to dig through the soil is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Time through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Time to dig through the clay:**
   - Bill digs at a rate of half his soil digging rate through clay, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - The time to dig through the clay is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Time through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Total time to dig the well:**
   - The total time is the sum of the time through soil and the time through clay:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."
"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the total number of individuals who will receive cupcakes and the number of cupcakes each person will get.

First, let's identify the total number of people:
- Howie himself
- His teacher
- His 25 classmates

This gives us a total of:
\[ 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 \text{ people} \]

Each person will receive 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate). Therefore, the total number of cupcakes needed is:
\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Thus, the correct number of cupcakes Howie should buy is \(\boxed{54}\)."

"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we can analyze the scenario through the lens of cost-benefit analysis and the concept of value. 

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday, totaling $400. She received a $2 discount, making her final cost $398. 

Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each on Wednesday, totaling $600. She received a 10% discount, making her final cost $540.

The difference in the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila is the result of different pricing strategies and discounts offered on different days. Philosophically, this scenario highlights the concept of value and how it can be influenced by external factors such as discounts and pricing changes.

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract Clara's final cost from Sheila's final cost:

\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:

\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into clear steps, drawing from a philosophical approach to understanding and analyzing the given information.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Ariadne sells hats of two colors: red and green.
   - In the first month, she earned $400 from red hats.
   - This amount is half of what she earned from green hats in the same month.

2. **Calculating Earnings from Green Hats:**
   - If $400 is half of the earnings from green hats, then the earnings from green hats must be $800.

3. **Total Earnings in the First Month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Earnings from red hats + Earnings from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200.

4. **Earnings in the Second Month:**
   - The earnings in the second month are \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total earnings in the first month.
   - Therefore, earnings in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\).

5. **Total Earnings Over Two Months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = $1200 + $900 = $2100.

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is \(\boxed{2100}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total time James hires the carriage:**
   - James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour:**
   - James gets 1 hour free, so he only needs to pay for 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for each hour:**
   - The first hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost for the first hour: $15
   - Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60
   - Total cost: $15 + $60 = $75

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{75}\)."

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Lori will need, let's break down the problem philosophically and logically.

First, we need to understand the relationship between the number of deviled egg halves and the number of whole eggs required. Each whole egg is used to make 2 deviled egg halves. Lori anticipates that each of her 16 guests will eat 3 deviled egg halves. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

Next, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

Finally, we need to convert the number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the underlying principles of cost and value. The question involves comparing the costs of two different mixtures of almonds and walnuts. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

Thus, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve this problem, we can use a philosophical approach to logical reasoning and mathematical problem-solving. Let's break it down step by step.

We are given:
1. The total number of animal heads is 20.
2. The total number of animal legs is 70.
3. Sheep have 1 head and 4 legs.
4. Geese have 1 head and 2 legs.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of time and collective action. The question asks for the total time spent sleeping by a specific group of teachers, which can be approached through the lens of collective behavior and the measurement of time.

Given that there are 150 teachers and 60% of them are history teachers, we can calculate the number of math teachers as follows:

\[ 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \text{ (history teachers)} \]
\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \text{ (math teachers)} \]

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money each person has and then find out how much they would each have if they shared the total amount equally.

First, let's establish the amount of money Aurelia has, which is given as $120.

Next, we calculate Kassidy's money. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Aurelia has:
\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we find out how much Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy:
\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add up the total amount of money:

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow a series of logical steps grounded in the principles of measurement and growth rate.

First, we convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the current height of 20 feet is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the additional height the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional 360 inches:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - Each dog needs one toy, so James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - Since the 3 dogs that left no longer need toys, James no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can use a proportional reasoning approach.

First, we establish the ratio of potatoes to hash browns:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} \]

We need to find out how many hash browns (\(x\)) can be made from 96 potatoes. We set up the proportion:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{x \text{ hash browns}} \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{36 \times 96}{6} \]

\[ x = 6 \times 96 \]

\[ x = 576 \]

Therefore, the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{576} \]"
"To determine by how much the total weight of Jack and 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we first calculate the total weight. Assuming each person weighs an average of 80 kg, the total weight is:

\[ 8 \text{ adults} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} + 1 \text{ adult (Jack)} \times 80 \text{ kg/adult} = 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. Therefore, the excess weight is:

\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight exceeds the maximum load by 20 kg."
"Given the problem, let's analyze the relationships between the number of cookies each person has:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we sum the cookies each person has:

\[68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298\]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is \(\boxed{298}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original length of the dress before any extensions or additions were made. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's establish the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Adding these times together gives the total time:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and equations based on the given information:

1. Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
2. Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, using the value of \( T \) to find \( W \):
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

Therefore, the age of one of the twins is \(\boxed{25.5}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that four candies cost $3.20. Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
So, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years, given their monthly savings rates.

First, let's establish the monthly savings for each individual:
- Rong saves 20 coins per month.
- Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong, which means Neil saves \(20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins per month.

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, the total number of months is:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Now, we calculate the total savings for each individual:
- Rong's total savings: \(20 \times 120 = 2400\) coins.
- Neil's total savings: \(28 \times 120 = 3360\) coins.

Adding these together gives the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil:

Now, we apply the 10% discount, which means Marcus pays 90% of the total cost:
\[ \$50.00 \times 0.90 = \$45.00 \]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can get with $6.00, we need to consider the deal: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

So, for every $3.00, Erin gets 3 scoops of ice cream.

Now, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops Erin can get with $6.00:
\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:
\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin can get 6 scoops of ice cream with $6.00.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total consumption of candy by both Ginger and Amy over the given period and then find the difference.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Over two weeks (14 days), she consumes:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Over two weeks (14 days), she consumes:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, the remaining candy for each is:
- Ginger: \( 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \)
- Amy: \( 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \)

The difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger is:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

"To determine the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculate the taps for each foot separately.

First, let's consider the time when her arms are down (3 minutes):
- Right foot: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)

Next, let's consider the time when her arms are raised (2 minutes):
- Right foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
- Left foot: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)

Now, we sum the taps for each foot:
- Total right foot taps: \(900 + 400 = 1300\)
- Total left foot taps: \(750 + 400 = 1150\)

Finally, we add the total taps for both feet:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we calculate the number of slices eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages. We start by noting the time it takes for the cat to eat the sausages, which is 30 minutes. The dog, on the other hand, can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To solve the problem, let's first convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can calculate the total length as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"

"To determine how many students like to play video games, we can follow a structured approach:

1. **Total Students**: The class has 50 students.
2. **Students Baking**: 10 students like to bake.
3. **Students Playing Basketball**: 5 students like to play basketball.
4. **Students Playing Music**: The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now, we sum the students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music:
\[ 10 \, (\text{baking}) + 5 \, (\text{basketball}) + 10 \, (\text{music}) = 25 \]

To find the number of students who like to play video games, we subtract the sum from the total number of students:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds in the backyard. After throwing a stone, he scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them. This means he scared away:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

So, the number of birds left after the stone was thrown is:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

\[ 8 + 20 = 28 \]

**Final Answer: 28**"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in both classes is 80.
   - Since the classes are equal in size, each class has:
     \[
     \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls in each class:**
   - 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   - Therefore, the number of girls in each class is:
     \[
     0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   - The total number of students in each class is 40.
   - The number of boys is the total number of students minus the number of girls:
     \[
     40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys}
     \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

4. Mara eats 2 slices:
   \[
   15 - 2 = 13 \text{ slices}
   \]
5. Her friend steals 5 slices:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]

Therefore, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of grooming jobs she has. This includes:

- 8 dogs to be bathed
- 5 cats to have their nails clipped
- 3 birds to have their wings trimmed
- 12 horses to be brushed

Adding these together gives the total number of grooming jobs:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of grooming jobs by 7 to find out how many animals she will groom each day:
\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week."
"To determine Mark's profit, we need to calculate the total cost and the total value of the cards he received. 

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each.
- Total cost = 3 packs * $1800/pack = $5400.

Next, let's calculate the total value of the cards:
- He received one card worth $4000.
- Another card worth $1000.
- 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.
- Total value of the 30 additional cards = 30 cards * $50/card = $1500.
- Total value of all cards = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500.

Now, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
- Profit = Total value of cards - Total cost = $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

Therefore, the profit Mark made is \(\boxed{1100}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, Carl has:
   \[
   4 \times 56 = 224 \text{ marbles}
   \]
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, Cal has:
   \[
   2 \times 56 = 112 \text{ marbles}
   \]
4. To find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:
   \[
   224 + 112 = 336
   \]

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of groups and the concept of division. Initially, fifty-four students are divided into six groups of equal size. This division is a form of categorization, which is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and organization. Each of these six groups contains nine students, as \( \frac{54}{6} = 9 \).

The question then asks how many more groups are needed to form if the activity requires twelve groups. This involves a re-categorization of the same set of students. To achieve twelve groups, each group would contain \( \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \) students. Since we cannot have half a student in a group, this re-categorization would require additional groups beyond the original six.

Given that we already have six groups, and we need twelve, the number of additional groups required is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week period, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week period is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Weekends:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week period, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week period is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total for One 4-Week Period:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week period is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total for Two 4-Week Periods:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week periods is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the actions of Gunther and Arnold over the days.

1. **Initial Bananas**: Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. **First Day**: Arnold steals half of the bananas.
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ bananas stolen}
   \]
   So, Gunther is left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. **Second Day**: Gunther adds 25 more bananas.
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. **Third Day**: Arnold steals 12 bananas.
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. **Fourth Day**: Gunther adds 6 more bananas.
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Thus, the final number of bananas in the pile is:

"To determine how much each of Jenna's roommates will pay per year for electricity, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the monthly share for each roommate. The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 5 people sharing the bill equally. Therefore, the monthly share for each person is:
\[ \text{Monthly share} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the annual share for each roommate. Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual share for each person is:
\[ \text{Annual share} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."
"Jeff initially sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party. Converting dozens to individual items, we have:

- 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses
- 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. Therefore, the remaining items are:

- Remaining glasses = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses
- Remaining plates = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

So, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

Final numerical answer:
86 glasses and 42 plates"
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the trades Lorraine makes and convert all her stickers into buttons. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

6. **Total Number of Buttons:**
   - Total buttons = 27 (small) + 20 (large) + 60 (small) = 107

**Final Answer:**
Lorraine has 107 buttons by the end."

"To solve this problem, we can use a simple algebraic approach. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of council members is 33, so the sum of the votes in favor and against is 33. This gives us the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the requirements for each shirt size:

1. **Extra-Small (XS) Shirts:**
   - 11 students need size extra-small.

2. **Small (S) Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of small shirts = \(2 \times 11 = 22\).

3. **Medium (M) Shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of medium shirts = \(22 - 4 = 18\).

4. **Large (L) Shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of large shirts = \(\frac{18}{2} = 9\).

5. **Extra-Large (XL) Shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of extra-large shirts = \(9 + 6 = 15\).

Now, let's sum up all the shirts:

\[
11 \text{ (XS)} + 22 \text{ (S)} + 18 \text{ (M)} + 9 \text{ (L)} + 15 \text{ (XL)} = 75

"To determine how many people think horse #12 will win, we start by calculating the number of people who think horse #2 will win. Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, we have:

\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

Next, we find the number of people remaining after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Of these remaining 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win:

\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. Therefore, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining people:

\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house be \( x \).
2. The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the first house, so it will need \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
3. The third house will need double the first house, so it will need \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To solve this equation, first combine the terms on the left side:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = \frac{500}{7} \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, and we are dealing with whole cases, we can conclude that the third house will need 100 cases of shingles (as the problem context suggests whole numbers).

Therefore, the number of cases of shingles the third house will need is \(\boxed{100}\)."

"To determine the total number of fruits George has, we start by calculating the number of pears he possesses. Given that George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas, we can find the number of pears as follows:

Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of the number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + 0.45 * 200
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Next, we add the number of pears to the number of bananas to find the total number of fruits:

Total number of fruits = Number of pears + Number of bananas
Total number of fruits = 290 + 200
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, the total number of fruits George has is 490."

3. To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add the number of books each has read:
   \[450 + 150 = 600\]

Therefore, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed together is:
\[600\]"
"Tanya's earnings can be calculated by considering her hourly wage and any additional bonuses for teaching more than 3 classes.

For Monday:
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- Her hourly wage is $15, so for 5 hours, she earns \(5 \times 15 = 75\) dollars.
- Since she taught more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Monday are \(75 + 5 = 80\) dollars.

For Wednesday:
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours.
- Her hourly wage is $15, so for 2 hours, she earns \(2 \times 15 = 30\) dollars.
- Since she did not teach more than 3 classes, she does not earn the additional $5.
- Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Adding her earnings from both days:
- Monday: $80
- Wednesday: $30
- Total: \(80 + 30 = 110\) dollars.

Thus, Tanya earned a total of $110 for these two days of teaching."

2. He gives 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. This means he gives away:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \text{ pencils}
   \]
   After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:
   \[
   50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils}
   \]
3. Next, Anthony gives 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. The number of pencils given to Charlie is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \text{ pencils}
   \]
   After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is \(\boxed{10}\)."

1. **Total number of movies**: 600

2. **Movies in series**: A third of the movies are in series.
   \[
   \text{Movies in series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
   \]

3. **Cost for series movies**: Each series movie costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200
   \]

4. **Remaining movies**: Subtract the series movies from the total.
   \[
   \text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
   \]

5. **Older movies**: 40% of the remaining movies are older movies.
   \[
   \text{Older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
   \]

6. **Cost for older movies**: Each older movie costs $5.
   \[

"In the context of the problem presented, we can analyze it through a philosophical lens, focusing on the concept of fairness and the nature of competition. The question essentially asks for the difference in scores between two individuals, Ava and Emma, based on their performance in a video game level.

Let's break down the scoring system:
- Points for enemies: 10 points per enemy
- Points for berries: 5 points per berry
- Points for time: 30 points for every second left on the timer

Given:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

We can represent the scores as follows:
- Emma's score: \(10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t\)
- Ava's score: \(10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4)\)

Simplifying Ava's score:
\[10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215\]

The difference in scores is:
\[ (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) = 215 \]

Thus, the difference between their two scores is:

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which totals to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual amount, which is:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, resulting in:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding these together, the total number of rides in a week is:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the relationships between the quantities of fish.

Initially, Bob has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After purchasing more fish, the total number of fish in the pond is 17. Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish as \(W\). Therefore, we have the equation:

\[O + W = 17\]

Additionally, after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:

\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the second equation:

\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\):

\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \(O + W = 17\)
2. \(O - 2W = 5\)

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):

\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this into the second equation:

\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:

\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide by -3:

\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, substitute \(W = 4\) back into the equation \(O = 17 - W\):

\[O = 17 - 4 = 13\]

To verify, check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:

\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:

\(\boxed{4}\)"

- She received ten twenties, which amounts to \(10 \times 20 = 200\) dollars.
- She also received 140 quarters, which amounts to \(140 \times 0.25 = 35\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total money Carrie received is:
\[200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, we calculate how much money Carrie spent:
- She spent \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the twenties. So, the amount spent on the twenties is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120\) dollars.
- She spent all the quarters, which is 35 dollars.

Adding these amounts together, the total amount of money Carrie spent is:
\[120 + 35 = 155 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is \(\boxed{155}\)."

"Certainly! Let's approach this problem from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the essence of the question and the logical steps required to solve it.

Mike is looking to purchase a pair of jeans that are on sale for 25% off. The original price of the jeans is $40. To find the sale price, we need to calculate the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

First, we calculate the discount:
\[ \text{Discount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10 \]

So, the discount is $10. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale Price} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

Mike pays with a $50 bill, so we subtract the sale price from $50 to find out how much money he will have left over:
\[ \text{Money Left Over} = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Mike will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of ethics and the distribution of resources. The company's decision to hire 20 new employees each month can be seen as an ethical action aimed at expanding its workforce, which may contribute to economic growth and job creation. However, the financial implications of this decision must also be considered.

Given that each of the 260 employees (200 initial employees + 60 new hires) is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total monthly salary expense for the company is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars} \]

For three months, the total salary expense would be:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

   \]

Thus, the choir will be caroling for a total of 540 seconds."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concept of fairness and the distribution of resources. The question involves a comparison of earnings between two individuals, Billy and Sally, over a period of time.

Billy's wage progression can be seen as a case of incremental improvement and recognition of his value over time. Initially, he was paid $10 per hour, then received a raise to $10.50 per hour after 2 months, and finally to $11.50 per hour on his first anniversary. This progression reflects a recognition of his contributions and possibly an adjustment for inflation or market rates.

Sally, on the other hand, started at a higher rate than Billy, at $10.50 per hour, which is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate. This initial advantage can be seen as a form of compensation for starting in a different business or perhaps having a different set of skills or experience.

Given that both work 20 hours, we can calculate their earnings:
- Billy's earnings: \(20 \times 11.50 = 230\) dollars.
- Sally's earnings: \(20 \times 10.50 = 210\) dollars.

The difference in their earnings is:
\[230 - 210 = 20\] dollars.

Therefore, Billy earns \(\boxed{20}\) dollars more than Sally."

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of her total collection, we first need to calculate the current total number of stuffed animals she has. Bubbles currently has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs. Adding these together gives:

\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of this total, so we set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance covered by the first car is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
   - In 2 hours, the distance covered by the second car is:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Determine the difference in distance between the two cars:**
   - The difference in distance is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, the final amount James paid is:
\[ \boxed{1170} \]"
"To determine the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students who took the test, then find the ratio of these two numbers.

1. **Third-graders:**
   - 340 out of 500 third-graders passed.

2. **Fourth-graders:**
   - 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed.

3. **Fifth-graders:**
   - The pass rate for fifth graders is twice the fourth graders' pass rate.
   - The fourth graders' pass rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \) or 40%.
   - Therefore, the fifth graders' pass rate is \( 2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \) or 80%.
   - The number of fifth-graders who passed is \( 0.8 \times 400 = 320 \).

4. **Total number of students who passed:**
   - Third-graders: 340
   - Fourth-graders: 40
   - Fifth-graders: 320
   - Total number of students who passed: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)

5. **Total number of students:**
   - Third-graders: 500
   - Fourth-graders: 100
   - Fifth-graders: 400
   - Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

6. **Overall pass rate:**
   - Overall pass rate = \( \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.7 \) or 70%

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, given the current amount and the consumption by the students.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \text{ gallons} \]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concepts of supply, demand, and surplus in the context of Dale's butterscotch candy sales.

Initially, Dale had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies. 

Let's break down the situation:

1. **Initial Supply**: 100 candies
2. **Demand**: 150 candies sold
3. **Additional Order**: 100 candies

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
\[ 100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
\[ 200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies} \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To determine the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Condition**: At the beginning of January, there are 10 students.
2. **Doubling Process**:
   - **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
   - **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
   - **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
   - **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
   - **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

3. **Additional Students Calculation**: To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:
   \[
   320 - 10 = 310
   \]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow a straightforward calculation based on the information provided.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs and made a total of $105 during the week. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, to find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach of analyzing each component of the scenario:

1. **Initial Flower Collection:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - She drops 1 flower of each type, so she loses:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.
   - Total petals lost: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

4. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   - Subtract the lost petals from the total: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"In the scenario presented, John and DeSean initially had 35 marshmallows to make S'mores. John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, using a total of 18 marshmallows. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. This means a total of 21 marshmallows are no longer available for making S'mores. 

Starting with 35 marshmallows, after accounting for the 21 that are no longer usable, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

These 14 marshmallows can be used to make 14 S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these S'mores equally, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the playing times and the cost of quarters for each person involved.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(\frac{240}{20} = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(\frac{240}{30} = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the quantities of each ingredient.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2z + 4s = 10
   \]
   Dividing the entire equation by 2, we obtain:
   \[
   z + 2s = 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( z \):**
   From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
   \[
   z = 5 - 2s
   \]

4. **Determine the Amount of Oil:**
   The amount of oil is \( 2s \). To find the specific value, we need to ensure that \( z \) is a positive quantity. Since \( z = 5 - 2s \), \( s \) must be less than 2.5. For simplicity, let's assume \( s = 1 \):
   \[
   z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]
   This satisfies the equation, and the amount of oil is:
   \[
   2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we can break down the problem into simpler steps. First, we calculate the total cost of the goats and then the total cost of the cows. Finally, we add these two amounts together.

   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. John buys 2 cows at $1500 each. The total cost for the cows is:
   \[
   2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Adding the total cost of the goats and the cows gives us the overall amount spent:
   \[
   1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is \(\boxed{4500}\) dollars."

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps to determine how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving some to his mother.

1. **Determine the Initial Number of Cars Joe Has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the Number of Cars Joe Sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the Number of Cars Joe Gives Away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the Remaining Number of Cars:**
   - Joe initially had 40 cars.
   - After selling 8 cars, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars.
   - After giving away 16 cars, he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars.

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how much each student raised, we start by identifying the total amount raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to distribute this amount equally among the 20 students. Thus, the amount raised by each student is:

"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we can analyze the scenario through the lens of fairness and the impact of context on performance. Sasha and Julie, as best friends, are playing on opposing teams in a series of practice games. The first game, where Sasha had the home court advantage, resulted in Sasha scoring 14 points and Julie scoring 4 fewer, which is 10 points. The second game, an away game for Sasha, saw Sasha score 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, which is 4 points.

From a philosophical standpoint, we can consider the concept of fairness and the influence of context on performance. The home court advantage and the away game context likely affected Sasha's performance. Despite these contextual factors, Sasha's total points across both games can be calculated as follows:

1. First game: Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Second game: Sasha scored 4 points.

Adding these together, Sasha's total points are:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:

\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

   \[
   \text{Roy's savings} = 30 + 12 = 42
   \]

Thus, the amount of money Roy has is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. **Pompei's lifting capacity:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

2. **Saskay's lifting capacity:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift \( 12 \times 1 = 12 \) inches.

3. **Kagiyami's lifting capacity:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) inches.

4. **Naruto's lifting capacity:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift \( 10 \times 48 = 480 \) inches.

5. **Convert inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Therefore, \( 480 \) inches is \( \frac{480}{12} = 40 \) feet.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine the total distance Mason has traveled, we can break down his journey into two segments and calculate the distance for each segment separately.

1. For the first segment:
   - Speed = 8 miles per hour
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. For the second segment:
   - Speed = 8 miles per hour
   - Time = 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Adding the distances from both segments gives us the total distance traveled:
- Total distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we need to consider the nature of speed, time, and distance. Let's break down the scenario:

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: We have three kangaroos traveling at the same speed, and they take 18 hours to cross a certain distance. We need to determine how long it will take for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance.

2. **Analyzing Speed and Time**: The speed of the kangaroos is \(v\). Therefore, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
   \]
   This means the total distance is 54 times the speed of one kangaroo.

3. **Turtles' Speed**: Each turtle travels at \(\frac{v}{2}\). The combined speed of four turtles is:
   \[
   4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
   \]

4. **Calculating Time for Turtles**: The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
   \[
   t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is \(\boxed{27}\) hours."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the number of clay dishes each person made.

1. Kora made 20 clay dishes.
2. Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so Rory made \(20 + 20 = 40\) clay dishes.
3. Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so Jada made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) clay dishes.

Now, we sum the number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
\[20 + 40 + 80 = 140\]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Erika has in her purse. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the reduced price of the laptop:**
   - Original price of the laptop: $600
   - Reduction for trading in her old laptop: $200
   - Reduced price: \( 600 - 200 = 400 \) dollars

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Erika has:**
   - Money from her part-time job: $150
   - Money from her mom: $80
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money in her purse.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Total amount of money Erika has: \( x + 150 + 80 = x + 230 \)
   - She still needs $50 to buy the laptop, so the total amount she has is $350.
   - Therefore, \( x + 230 = 350 \)

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x + 230 = 350 \)
   - \( x = 350 - 230 \)
   - \( x = 120 \)

Thus, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by understanding the current production capacity. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. The farmer currently has 3 cows, which means his current production is:

\[ 3 \, \text{cows} \times 5 \, \text{liters/cow/day} = 15 \, \text{liters/day} \]

The farmer aims to increase his production to 25 liters per day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \, \text{liters/day} - 15 \, \text{liters/day} = 10 \, \text{liters/day} \]

Since each additional cow will produce 5 liters of milk per day, the number of additional cows required is:

\[ \frac{10 \, \text{liters/day}}{5 \, \text{liters/cow/day}} = 2 \, \text{cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to achieve his goal of producing 25 liters of milk a day.

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase:

- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800

Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

- Money from working: $5000
- Money from brother: $200

Total money Gabriel has = $5000 + $200 = $5200

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total money he has from the total cost:

Money still needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\boxed{5600}\)."

1. **Initial Amount of Money:**
   Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills, which totals:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Squirt Guns:**
   Craig buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the total cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"Given the scenario, let's analyze the relationships and quantities step by step:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's sum up the total number of socks and dishes:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given categories and the total number of students. We know there are 20 students in total, with 5 students good at math only and 8 students performing well in English only. The rest are good at both subjects.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects:
\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]
\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, we find the total number of students who are good at math by adding those who are good at math only and those who are good at both:
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} \]
\[ \text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to consider the total time each group requires and the overall duration of the concert, including any intermissions.

Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 10 minutes per group.

The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There is also a 10-minute intermission.

Subtracting the intermission from the total concert time gives us:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Now, we divide the available time by the time each group needs:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to apply the concept of simple interest. Simple interest is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

In this scenario, Brenda's principal investment is $300, the annual interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, and the time period is 3 years. First, we calculate the annual interest rate:

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:

\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the essence of the question in terms of categorization and comparison. The question essentially asks for a numerical comparison between two sets of items based on specific attributes.

1. **White Shirts with Collars**: Half of the 40 white shirts have collars, which means 20 white shirts have collars.
2. **White Shirts without Collars**: Since 20 out of 40 white shirts have collars, the remaining 20 white shirts do not have collars.
3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons**: Out of the 50 floral shirts, 20 have buttons.
4. **Floral Shirts without Buttons**: Since 20 out of 50 floral shirts have buttons, the remaining 30 floral shirts do not have buttons.

The question asks how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars. Given that there are 30 floral shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars, the difference is:

\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of value and exchange in economic transactions. The farmer has a total of 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. The value of each tray is determined by the market rate, which in this case is $2.5 per tray.

First, we calculate the number of trays needed to hold all the eggs:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:
\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the farmer will earn:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

   - Farm Y: 45 goats

2. **Goats Sold:**
   - From Farm X: 10 goats
   - From Farm Y: Twice as many as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats

3. **Goats Left in Each Farm:**
   - Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats
   - Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats

4. **Total Goats Left:**
   - Total = Goats left in Farm X + Goats left in Farm Y
   - Total = \(45 + 25 = 70\)

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays, we can follow a structured approach rooted in philosophical reasoning and logical analysis.

First, we need to establish the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Given that he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, and there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of pairs as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and relationships clearly:

1. Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
2. Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).
3. Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
- You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
- The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{13}\)."

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can use a step-by-step approach, considering the exponential growth of infections.

1. **Day 0**: Initially, 10 people are infected.
2. **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others. Therefore, the number of new infections is \(10 \times 6 = 60\). The total number of infected people after the first day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).
3. **Day 2**: Each of the 70 infected people from the end of the first day infects 6 others. Thus, the number of new infections is \(70 \times 6 = 420\). The total number of infected people after the second day is \(70 + 420 = 490\).
4. **Day 3**: Each of the 490 infected people from the end of the second day infects 6 others. Consequently, the number of new infections is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\). The total number of infected people after the third day is \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we have:
\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \]
So, Rafaela received $800 in tips.

Next, we need to determine how much Julieta received. Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:
\[ 10\% \times 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \]
Since Julieta received 10% less, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips:
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \]
So, Julieta received $720 in tips.

To find the total amount of tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we add their individual totals together:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:
\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer initially bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her three daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. She also gave 3 oranges to her son.

1. **Red Cars**: There are 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars**: The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. **Blue Cars**: The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[75 - 52 = 23\]

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of books each person has using variables and then use the given relationships to form equations.

Let:
- \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of utility and resource allocation. Greg wants to ensure that each of the 30 kids at his son's outdoor birthday party can have 4 jello cups, totaling 120 cups. Given that a three-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, we need to determine the number of boxes required and the cost.

First, we calculate the number of boxes needed:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost, given that each box is on sale for $1.25:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Greg will spend on jello is:

"To determine the amount of change the seller will give back, we first calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. Each phone costs $700, so the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller gives the electronics seller $4000. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change. 

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{500}\)"
"To determine how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, we first need to calculate the total monthly cost each person pays. Given that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we can calculate her contribution as follows:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's contribution is the remaining 40%:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his monthly contribution by 4 (since there are four weeks in a month):

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Therefore, the amount Keenan spends per week is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach of analyzing each part of the scenario carefully.

1. **Initial Condition**: Tobias starts with 60 pieces of pizza.

2. **First Day**: He eats \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the pieces.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Remaining pieces after the first day:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Second Day**: He eats 10 pieces.
   Remaining pieces after the second day:
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}

"To solve the problem, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Bacon**: Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon for a total of $10. Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]

2. **Chicken**: Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Thus, the cost per packet of chicken is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars per packet}
   \]
   Since she has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost for chicken is:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries**: Each pack of strawberries costs $4. Therefore, the total cost for 3 packs of strawberries is:
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples**: Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, which is:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pack}
   \]
   Since she has 7 packs of apples, the total cost for apples is:
   \[

"In the scenario presented, the singer has 50 microphones and wants to arrange them in pairs on a stage. However, 20% of these microphones are unable to find a space to fit in after pairing the rest. To determine how many pairs can be arranged, we first calculate the number of microphones that do not fit:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones are left without a pair. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since these 40 microphones are arranged in pairs, the number of pairs is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down philosophically and logically.

First, we need to understand the context and the relationships given in the problem. Tasha made a total of $80 from both selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The problem provides information about the number of times she mowed different lawns in relation to Joe's lawn.

Let's define the variables:
- \( J \) = number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- \( K \) = number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- \( A \) = number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J \) is an integer. Let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine Harry's weight, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. Martin's weight is given as 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. Therefore, Carl's weight is:
   \[
   55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg}

3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. Therefore, Christian's weight is:
   \[
   71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. Therefore, Harry's weight is:
   \[
   79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Thus, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."

   So, Joseph had 6 notebooks.

4. **Current Condition**: After Martha's purchase, she now has 7 notebooks. Joseph still has 6 notebooks.

5. **Difference**: To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph now, we calculate the difference:
   \[
   7 - 6 = 1
   \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the distance Anis rowed. Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed \( 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 50 + 10 = 60 \) miles.

The total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis is the sum of the distances each rowed, which is \( 50 + 60 = 110 \) miles.

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:
110 miles."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Pages Read Yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages Read Today:**
   - Daniel did not read any pages today, so he read 0 pages.
   - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

3. **Total Pages Read:**
   - Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
   - Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

4. **Difference in Pages Read:**
   - The difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel is \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

Therefore, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we need to consider the nature of resources and distribution. The key here is understanding the initial quantity of soup and how it is allocated among the family members.

Calvin's pot can fill:
- 4 adult bowls or
- 8 child bowls

Calvin and his wife are adults, and they have 2 children. If everyone eats one bowl at the meal, the total number of bowls needed for the family is:
- 2 adult bowls (for Calvin and his wife) + 2 child bowls (for the children) = 4 bowls

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls, the total amount of soup in the pot is equivalent to 4 adult bowls. This means the pot has enough soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.

After the family has eaten their bowls, the pot has been completely used up. Therefore, there is no leftover soup for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"William bought five notebooks at $1.50 each and one ballpen at $0.50. To find the total amount he spent, we calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add them together.

The cost of the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

The cost of the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount William spent is $8.00."
"To determine the amount of material Jo needs, we can break down the problem into the materials required for small and large masks separately and then sum them up.

For small masks:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is \( \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards} \).
- For 20 small masks, the material required is \( 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards} \).

For large masks:
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is \( \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards} \).
- For 8 large masks, the material required is \( 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards} \).

Adding the material needed for both small and large masks:
- Total material required = \( 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \).

Thus, the total amount of material Jo needs is \(\boxed{16}\) yards."

"To determine the number of books Joseph currently has, we start by identifying the initial number of books each person has. Sarah has 9 books. Joseph originally had twice the number of Sarah's books, which means Joseph had \(2 \times 9 = 18\) books. After losing 2 books, Joseph now has \(18 - 2 = 16\) books.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Joseph currently has 16 books."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Dean has left after giving some to Jamie and Donald.

1. Dean starts with 30 marbles.
2. He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. This is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
   \]
   So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.
3. Dean then gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Next, we calculate the total number of marbles Dean gives away:
\[
6 + 10 = 16
\]

Finally, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles Dean had:
\[
30 - 16 = 14

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of the ages and the relationship given.

1. Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age, and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.
2. According to the problem, Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
3. The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be expressed as:
   \[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
4. Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
   \[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
   \[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
5. Dividing both sides by 2:
   \[ 26 = A - 4 \]
6. Adding 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
   \[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"To determine the total number of acres for both Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms, we start by identifying the size of each farm.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. Therefore, we calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:

1. Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm: \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.
2. Adding 100 acres more: \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the sizes of both farms:

\[200 + 500 = 700\] acres.

Thus, the two farms together have a total of 700 acres."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Colby earns in an eight-hour workday given his pay rate and the number of packages he completes per hour.

First, let's establish the number of packages Colby completes per hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works in a day:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much money he earns for completing 320 packages. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package, we multiply the number of packages by his pay rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the temporal and physiological aspects of John's activity. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, and solving an extreme sudoku puzzle takes him 4 times longer than a normal one. A normal sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes, so an extreme one takes 180 minutes.

From a philosophical standpoint, we can analyze the relationship between time, action, and consumption. The question essentially asks us to quantify John's consumption of water in relation to his activity duration.

1. **Duration of Extreme Sudoku Puzzle**: 180 minutes.
2. **Water Consumption Rate**: 1 bottle every 30 minutes.

To find out how many bottles John drinks, we divide the total time by the interval at which he drinks water:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, the number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

We are given that Benny threw bologna at his balloons, with 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58, and there are 20 red balloons.

Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). We know \( R = 20 \).

The equation representing the total pieces of bologna thrown is:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

To find \( Y \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we must first calculate the total distance Jon drives in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles each day, the total distance driven in 30 days is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval at which tune-ups are needed:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon's car needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   We sum the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over these three days is:
\[

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of fairness and equality. The question involves a scenario where Julia and Nadine, having received the same allowance from their mother, decide to pool their resources to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream for their father's birthday. The key is to determine the initial amount each girl received.

Let's break down the expenses:
1. **Cake**: $11
2. **Balloons**: Since 12 balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the total cost for 12 balloons is $3.
3. **Ice cream**: 2 tubs at $7 each cost $14.

Adding these expenses together:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, and they had the same amount, we can conclude that each received half of the total amount. Therefore, each girl received:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"To determine the total number of students, we need to sum the students participating in each activity. According to the problem:

- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- There are twice as many students playing volleyball, which means \(2 \times 6 = 12\) students.
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total for soccer is \(16 + 22 = 38\) students.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 6 + 12 + 38 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the ethical and practical dimensions of the scenario. The question involves the economic activity of selling lollipops to raise money for a class fund. From a philosophical standpoint, we can analyze the actions and outcomes in terms of utility, justice, and virtue.

1. **Utility**: The act of selling lollipops can be seen as a means to achieve a positive outcome—raising money for the class fund. The utility of this action is clear in its direct benefit to the class.

2. **Justice**: The distribution of the workload (selling lollipops) among the 30 students is equitable, as each student sold an average of 10 lollipops. This ensures that the burden is shared fairly.

3. **Virtue**: The action demonstrates the virtue of diligence and responsibility, as the students are actively contributing to a common goal.

To calculate the profit, we need to determine the total revenue and subtract the total cost:

- **Total Revenue**: Each lollypop is sold for $0.8, and 300 lollipops were sold.
  \[
  300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Total Cost**: Each lollypop is bought for $0.5, and 300 lollipops were bought.
  \[
  300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Profit**: The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.
  \[
  240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to consider the daily consumption of both Abby and Josh. Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much, which means he eats 4 slices per day. Together, they consume \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day. Given that the loaf contains 24 slices, the number of days the loaf will last is calculated by dividing the total number of slices by the daily consumption: \(24 \div 6 = 4\).

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for \(\boxed{4}\) days."
"To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to consider the timeline of her shell collection. Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and continued to collect one shell every month until her 10th birthday. This means she collected shells for a period of 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months from age 5 to age 10 is:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Given that she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells collected is:
\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected \(\boxed{60}\) shells."
"To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is \(\boxed{4.5}\)."
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to consider the time constraints and the total number of berries required.

1. **Calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:**
   - Each trip (down and back up) takes 4 hours.
   - Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of berries picked per trip:**
   - The sloth needs to collect 24 berries in total.
   - If the sloth makes 2 trips, the number of berries per trip is:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, given the initial conditions and the rate of water usage.

1. **Initial Water in the Tank**: The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool. Since the pool has 10,000 gallons, the tank will have:
   \[
   \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Rate of Water Usage**: The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water emptied is:
   \[
   500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Water Remaining in the Tank**: Subtract the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount of water in the tank:
   \[
   5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:
\[
\boxed{2000}

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to carefully account for his spending and remaining budget. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Budget**: Colby starts with $150 each month.
2. **Spending Breakdown**:
   - He has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, each costing $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
   - He has seen 8 movies on other days, each costing $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
   - He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
   - He has had 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

3. **Total Spent**: Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
   \[
   50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130
   \]

4. **Remaining Budget**: Subtracting the total spent from the initial budget gives the remaining amount:
   \[
   150 - 130 = 20
   \]

5. **Current Day and Planned Spending**:
   - It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday.
   - He wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy.
   - The cost for these items is:
     \[
     10 + 8 + 2 = 20
     \]

6. **Affordability**: Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy.

Therefore, Colby can see one more movie on Friday. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total calories of the mini pastries Andrew baked. Each mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of its normal counterpart.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

Therefore, the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked is 85000."
"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

The difference in distance traveled is:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Maria's mom then gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, let's add up all the balloons:
- Balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by Maria's mom: 15

The total number of balloons is:
\[8 + 1 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of resource allocation and the efficient use of space. The charity group has a total of 60 boxes to sell at their yard sale. Each table can accommodate 2 boxes, meaning they need a total of 30 tables to display all the items. Given that they already own 15 tables, the number of new tables required can be calculated by subtracting the number of existing tables from the total needed.

\[ \text{Total tables needed} = \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes per table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]
\[ \text{New tables required} = 30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the average total distance spat in the watermelon seed spitting contest, we first need to calculate the total distance each participant spat their seeds.

For Zoey:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 10 feet.
- Total distance spat by Zoey = \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

For Sydney:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spat 12 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney = \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Next, we find the average of these total distances:
- Total distance spat by both = \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.
- Average total distance spat = \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

Therefore, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine over a month and then convert that into revenue.

1. **Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

2. **Calculate the revenue generated by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines:**

   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
   - Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much Cameron would save, let's break down the costs and compare them.

First, we calculate the cost for Cameron's stay under the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The initial 12-hour stay costs 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for an additional 5 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning), and each additional hour costs 70 pesos.
- The cost for the additional 5 hours is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay is \(1000 + 350 = 1350\) pesos.

Next, we calculate the cost for a 24-hour stay:
- The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of hay required for both goats and sheep based on the given conditions.

Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay required for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, twice that amount is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]
Subtracting 3 pounds from this amount gives:
\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
With 12 sheep, the total hay required for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay required for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay needed:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate John's Earnings:**
   John earns $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week.
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Subtract the Cost of Gas:**
   John spends $50 on gas.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Subtract the Amount to Deposit in the Bank:**
   John wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Cost of Pencils:**
   John buys 5 pencils, each costing $10.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Subtract the Cost of Pencils from the Remaining Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine How Many 25 Dollar Pens John Can Buy:**
   \[
   \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens}

"Given the information that Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first. Marcus is 21 years old (26 - 5 = 21). Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, Leo must be 42 years old (21 * 2 = 42).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Leo is 42 years old."
"To solve this problem, let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and relationships between the variables.

We are given that the total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Additionally, we know that Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo and 10 more points than Dinar. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we can establish the following relationships:
1. \( B + A + D = 45 \)
2. \( B = A + 20 \)
3. \( B = D + 10 \)

We can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( B = 25 \) back into the expressions for \( A \) and \( D \):
\[ A = 25 - 20 = 5 \]
\[ D = 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Thus, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to consider the given information and apply logical reasoning.

1. We know that 100 pages of paper stack to a thickness of 1 inch.
2. The book is 1.5 inches thick.
3. Each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, with one page on each side.

First, calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate:

\[
1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
\]

Since each sheet of paper is used for two pages (one on each side), we need to divide the total number of pages by 2 to find the actual number of pages in the book:

\[
\frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
\]

Therefore, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours. Converting this time into minutes, we get:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since he staples 30 reports in each interval, the total number of reports stapled is:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Converting 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons he initially has as follows:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, we get:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"In addressing the scenario, we can break down the problem into several logical steps, drawing from philosophical principles of analysis and reasoning.

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied, which means 200 beds are occupied and 800 are unoccupied.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over a period of 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is \(50 \times 14 = 700\) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, an additional 700 beds are occupied.
   - Therefore, the total number of occupied beds is \(200 + 700 = 900\).

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Subtracting the total occupied beds from the total capacity gives us the number of unoccupied beds: \(1000 - 900 = 100\).

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is **100**."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Emails Sent Daily**: Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. **Work Emails**: Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. **Non-Work Emails**: The remaining emails are not work emails. Therefore, the number of non-work emails is:
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]
4. **Emails to Family**: Two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. So, the number of emails sent to family is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
5. **Emails to Boyfriend**: The remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are sent to her boyfriend. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]
6. **One-Third of the Remaining Emails**: According to the problem, one-third of the remaining emails (which are already calculated to be 3) are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]

Thus, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective by breaking down the relationships and logical connections between the ages of Aliya, Shawna, and Shawna's father.

First, we establish the age of Aliya, which is given as 3 years old. According to the problem, Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Therefore, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we are told that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Using the age of Shawna, we can determine the age of Shawna's father:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the age of Shawna's father is 45 years old.

\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement by Courtney. If Courtney reported 48 people, and this number is 120% of the actual attendance, we can set up the equation:

\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the number of balls each boy carried.

1. Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
2. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
3. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 were filled in, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes

   Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29
   \]

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day:**
   - At the end of the first day, they had 10 holes.

3. **Calculate the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:**
   - By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40
   \]

4. **Find the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
   \[

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Therefore, the total number of corn chips they received together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Next, we are told that Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey. Since Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, Collins received:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the $400 he spends on supplies.

First, we calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, we add this amount to the original $400 to find the total cost of the tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and relationships between the variables given. Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe. This can be expressed as:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
where \( S \) represents the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, which can be written as:
\[ X = S + 5 \]
where \( X \) represents the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + S + X = 339 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( X \) into the equation, we get:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 13 + 5 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find the number of Pokemon caught by Stan:
\[ S = 4A - 13 \]
\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of episodes**: Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time spent watching the show is:
   \[
   20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southward direction after accounting for the northward travel.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Next, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"To determine the number of brownies Greta had left over, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

First, we calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, making his brother 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age, so she is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old. The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time Andy will spend restringing the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of string and then sum these times.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes per racquet:
   \[3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ minutes}\]

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string, it takes 22 minutes per racquet:
   \[5 \times 22 = 110 \text{ minutes}\]

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string), it takes 18 minutes per racquet:
   \[4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ minutes}\]

Adding these times together gives the total time:
\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time Andy will spend restringing all the racquets is 227 minutes."

Therefore, the total amount John paid for all the phones is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine the total number of players in both teams combined, we start by identifying the number of players on each team. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, we add the number of players on both teams to find the total number of players:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Boxes Purchased**: Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. **Boxes Given Away**: She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, totaling 4 boxes.
3. **Remaining Boxes**: After giving away 4 boxes, she has \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes left.
4. **Boxes Kept**: She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) boxes.
5. **Boxes Sold**: The number of boxes she sold is the remaining boxes after keeping some, which is \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes.

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \). According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wishes to purchase. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together gives us the total cost:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cherries each person has and then find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries.

First, we know that Robert has 30 cherries. According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. Therefore, Richard has:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we know the total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total, we can find out how many cherries Jerry has:
\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so the difference is:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

   - Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed:**
   - Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

3. **Determine the cost of the petunias:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

4. **Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

5. **Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
   - Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many roses can be planted given the soil requirements for sunflowers and carnations, and the total amount of soil available.

First, let's calculate the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil. With 4 sunflowers, the total soil used is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. With 10 carnations, the total soil used is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these amounts together gives the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider the rates at which she can perform each task.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**: Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
2. **Sautéing Shrimp**: Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.

First, let's calculate the time required for each task for 90 shrimp:
- **Peeling 90 Shrimp**: 
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- **Sautéing 90 Shrimp**: 
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Since both tasks need to be completed sequentially, we add the times together:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer:**
45 minutes"
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the changes in temperature over time, taking into account the different cooling rates and the warming effect when the air conditioner is off.

1. **Low Setting for 3 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High Setting for 4 Hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No Air Conditioner for 2 Hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Bill's age when he first saw Comet Halley. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet:**
   - According to the problem, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we can break down the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

1. **Identify the total number of flights for the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in a day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - This means \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights are to Greece.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).
   - Since these 22 flights are split equally, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Therefore, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tobias' Howl Duration**: Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. **Chikote's Howl Duration**: Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. **Igneous' Howl Duration**: Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's find the total duration of their howls combined:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the given information and applying logical reasoning.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Akbar's age \(A = 3\) years.
   - Alessandro's age \(B = 4\) years.
   - The total age of the children is 20 years.
   - Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group.
   - We need to find Wilfred's age \(W\).

2. **Set up the equation for the total age:**
   \[
   A + B + H + W = 20
   \]
   Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
   \[
   3 + 4 + H + W = 20
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   7 + H + W = 20
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   H + W = 13
   \]

3. **Use the information about Helene's age:**
   The average age of the group is:
   \[
   \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}
   \]
   Given that Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age:
   \[
   H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}
   \]
   Substituting the total age:
   \[
   H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Find Wilfred's age:**
   Using the equation \(H + W = 13\) and substituting \(H = 10\):
   \[
   10 + W = 13
   \]
   Solving for \(W\):
   \[
   W = 3
   \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Walter is collecting money for charity. He first collects $500 from his neighbors and then $1500 from an online fund. His lawyer offers to donate three times the total amount collected from these sources. The total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund is $500 + $1500 = $2000. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be 3 times $2000, which is $6000. 

The final answer is: $6000."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

   - There are 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(100 \times 15 = 1500\).

2. **Calculate the number of cookies given to the church:**
   - The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church.
   - So, the number of cookies given to the church is \(\frac{1500}{2} = 750\).

3. **Determine the number of people in the church:**
   - Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
   - Therefore, the number of people in the church is \(\frac{750}{15} = 50\).

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"In addressing the distribution of a watermelon among a family of six (2 adults and 4 kids) where each adult's slice is twice as large as each kid's, we can approach this problem from a philosophical standpoint, particularly focusing on fairness and proportionality.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Consequently, each adult's slice would be \(2x\). Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices can be represented as \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is thus \(8x\). Each adult's slice, being \(2x\), represents \(\frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4}\) of the total watermelon. Converting this fraction to a percentage, we get \(\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%\).

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

**Final Answer: 25%**"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time he spends on inpatient rounds and appointments, and then subtract this from his total clinic time.

First, let's calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds:
- Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
- Each inpatient visit takes 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the total time for inpatient rounds is \(9 \times 20 = 180\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
- Therefore, the total time for appointments is \(10 \times 30 = 300\) minutes.

Now, let's add the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments:
- Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments is \(180 + 300 = 480\) minutes.

Convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments to hours:
- \(480\) minutes is equivalent to \(480 \div 60 = 8\) hours.

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic. Subtract the time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from the total clinic time:
- Time left for updating records is \(9 - 8 = 1\) hour.

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to have it ready by 5:00 pm, we need to account for the total time required for each step of the process. The steps and their respective times are as follows:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours (120 minutes)
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours, Jordan needs to start 3 hours before 5:00 pm. Therefore, the latest time she can start making the cake is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

**2:00 \text{ pm}**"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, we can approach this problem from a philosophical standpoint, focusing on the logical structure of the given information.

We know that Lisa and Peter together sold 64 chocolate bars. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, making a total of 8 boxes. The question is to find out how many chocolate bars are in each box.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \). The total number of chocolate bars sold can be expressed as:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8:
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Thus, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(\boxed{8}\)."

1. **Cost per Session:**
   - Studio rental: $25
   - Cost per student per session: $1.50
   - Number of students: 10
   - Total cost per session for students: \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars
   - Total cost per session: \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars

2. **Cost per Day:**
   - Number of sessions per day: 3
   - Total cost per day: \(40 \times 3 = 120\) dollars

3. **Cost per Month:**
   - Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks
   - Total cost per week: \(120 \times 4 = 480\) dollars
   - Total cost per month: \(480 \times 1 = 480\) dollars

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"To address the problem philosophically, we can consider the essence of the question: it involves a comparison of quantities and their distribution across different sets. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we recognize that the problem is essentially a mathematical one, but we can approach it from a philosophical perspective by examining the concepts of distribution, equality, and difference.

1. **Understanding the Distribution:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

2. **Calculating the Number of Chocolate Bars per Box:**
   - For Peter: \( \frac{64}{4} = 16 \) chocolate bars per box.
   - For Martha: \( \frac{56}{7} = 8 \) chocolate bars per box.

3. **Comparing the Quantities:**
   - The difference in the number of chocolate bars per box is \( 16 - 8 = 8 \).

From a philosophical standpoint, this difference can be seen as a manifestation of the principle of distribution and the concept of equality. The question essentially asks us to identify the disparity in the distribution of resources (chocolate bars) between two individuals (Peter and Martha).

Therefore, the answer to the question ""How many more chocolate bars does Peter have in each box than Martha?"" is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the dynamics of population growth and the ethical implications of such growth in a natural setting. The initial population of porcupines is 50, and the number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population, which is 30. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Over the course of a year, the number of baby porcupines born can be calculated as follows:

1. **Number of female porcupines**: \(\frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30\).
2. **Number of baby porcupines born each month**: \(30 \times 4 = 120\).
3. **Number of baby porcupines born in a year**: \(120 \times 12 = 1440\).

Adding the initial population to the number of baby porcupines born in a year gives us the total population after a year:

\[50 + 1440 = 1490\]

Therefore, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is \(\boxed{1490}\)."
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow a series of logical steps based on the given information and apply the principles of measurement and cost calculation.

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet

   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4
   \]

2. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, calculate \(25 \times 14\):
   \[
   25 \times 14 = 350
   \]
   Next, multiply the result by 4:
   \[
   350 \times 4 = 1400
   \]

   Therefore, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

3. **Convert Volume to Gallons:**
   According to the pool company's instructions, we need to multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   \[
   1400 \times 5.9 = 8260
   \]

   So, the pool requires 8260 gallons of water.

5. **Calculate the Cost:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10
   \]

6. **Perform the Final Multiplication:**
   \[
   8260 \times 0.10 = 826
   \]

   Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{826}\)."
"To determine the total number of sticks, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, so there are \(9 + 5 = 14\) blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so there are \(14 - 3 = 11\) yellow sticks.

Adding these together, the total number of sticks is:
\[9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference.

For Matteo:
- Speed = 55 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy:
- Speed = 45 miles per hour
- Time = 10 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

The difference in the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo is:
- Difference = Distance traveled by Shandy - Distance traveled by Matteo = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo."

   \]

3. **Male students over 16 years old**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

4. **Female students over 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old**: 
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total number of female students**: 
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \(\boxed{1875}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey runs \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn runs \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn runs \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:

\[10 - 5 = 5\]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break down the contributions of Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then determine the remaining capacity of the tank.

1. **First Day:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Second Day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the second day:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park. Let's denote the initial charge as \( x \).

Given that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours, the charge remaining after 5 hours is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour, so the charge remaining after these 3 hours is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for a $10,000 car, we first need to calculate her total weekly earnings. Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \text{ per week} \]

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car for a down payment. The cost of the car is $10,000, so the down payment she needs is:

\[ 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, let's first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of sweets**: Anne purchased a box containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces.
   \[
   15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Sweets kept by Anne**: Anne kept 2 packs for herself.
   \[
   2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Sweets given to friends**: The remaining sweets were given to her 10 friends.
   \[
   900 \text{ pieces} - 120 \text{ pieces} = 780 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Sweets per friend**: Each of her 10 friends received an equal share of the remaining sweets.
   \[
   \frac{780 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend}

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which in this context is:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the distribution of the pictures as an exercise in categorization and the nature of classification. Olivia has 72 pictures, which she evenly distributes into 8 albums, meaning each album contains 9 pictures. Among these albums, 3 are dedicated to selfies and 2 are dedicated to portraits. The remaining 3 albums could contain a mix of both selfies and portraits, but the problem does not specify this, so we focus on the given information.

Given that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 are for portraits, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits as follows:

- Selfies: \(3 \times 9 = 27\)
- Portraits: \(2 \times 9 = 18\)

Adding these together, the total number of portraits and selfies is:

\[27 + 18 = 45\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\(\boxed{45}\)"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we can break down the problem using a proportional reasoning approach, a fundamental concept in philosophy that involves understanding relationships between quantities.

Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can establish a ratio to find out how long it takes to read 1 page:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes to read 18 pages, we multiply the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Time to read 18 pages} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests check out early, reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests check out late, further reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people check in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people check in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps, considering the distribution of question types and Aries's performance on each type.

1. **Determine the number of each type of question:**
   - Total questions: 60
   - Easy questions: \(40\% \times 60 = 24\)
   - Remaining questions: \(60 - 24 = 36\)
   - Average and difficult questions are equally divided: \(36 \div 2 = 18\) for each

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   - Easy questions: Aries is sure to get \(75\%\) of the easy questions correct.
     \[
     0.75 \times 24 = 18
     \]
   - Average questions: Aries is sure to get half of the average questions correct.
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]
   - Difficult questions: Aries is sure to get half of the difficult questions correct.
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]

3. **Sum up the total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   \[
   18 + 9 + 9 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down philosophically, focusing on the relationships and logical connections between the quantities involved.

We are given that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones. Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(3S\). We are also told that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so \(S = 4\). Consequently, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Next, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \(x\). Thus, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the total number of sandwiches consumed by the family in one week, we first calculate the daily consumption and then extend it to a week.

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Adding these together gives the total daily consumption:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily total by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Therefore, the family eats \(\boxed{77}\) sandwiches in one week."
"To determine how much money Suzanne has left after her sales and the contributions to her sisters, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total earnings from the cookies and cupcakes:
- Earnings from cookies: \(80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80\)
- Earnings from cupcakes: \(60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240\)

Next, sum these amounts to find the total earnings:
- Total earnings: \(\$80 + \$240 = \$320\)

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each for their help:
- Total given to sisters: \(2 \times \$10 = \$20\)

Subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find the remaining amount:
- Remaining amount: \(\$320 - \$20 = \$300\)

Therefore, the amount of money Suzanne has left is \(\$300\).

\(\boxed{300}\)"
"The total number of eggs hidden was 100. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. This leaves 40 eggs to be found by their friends. However, it is stated that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. Therefore, the friends found:

\[40 - 10 = 30\]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - Over 30 days, the total ore mined is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the principle of proportionality, a fundamental concept in philosophy that deals with the relationship between quantities. Here, we are given the cost of two packages and need to find the cost of a third package based on the same principle.

1. For the first package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   - Price: $3
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

2. For the second package:
   - Number of sandwiches: 4
   - Price: $6
   - Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the price per sandwich is consistent, we can use this rate to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concept of debt and payment as a form of temporal exchange. In this scenario, Tom is essentially exchanging a future sum of money for the immediate possession of a bedroom set, with the condition that he must pay a certain percentage of the remaining balance each month.

Given that Tom has a remaining balance of $2000 after selling his old bedroom set for $1000, and he must pay 10% of this balance each month, we can calculate his monthly payment as follows:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

Therefore, the amount Tom has to pay per month is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

89.8%"
"Certainly! Let's approach this problem from a philosophical standpoint, focusing on the distribution of resources and fairness.

Given that the Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people, and 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, we first need to determine the number of seats available for distribution to friends and family.

The total number of seats reserved is:
\[ 950 + 300 = 1250 \]

Subtracting these from the total capacity, we get:
\[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

These 4750 seats are to be distributed equally among the 950 graduates. To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we divide the number of available seats by the number of graduates:
\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer: 5**"
"To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans and then use these relationships to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large jelly beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small jelly beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.
   - Since Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, the number of small jelly beans he can eat is:
     \[
     150 \times 3 = 450
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the average loss per race, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the loss from the first race.
   - Calculation: \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the win from the second race.
   - Calculation: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit, which in this case will be inches.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height as follows:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\). According to the problem, the second person took \(x + 80\) and the third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\). The total amount is $1920. We can set up the following equation to represent the total distribution:

\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to apply the concept of depreciation over time. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year. We can use the formula for exponential decay to find the value after a certain number of years.

The formula for the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

Therefore, the number of kilometers Bernice still needs to drive is \(\boxed{1630}\)."
"To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of cups she consumes over this period. Given that she drinks 8 cups of water every day, over 30 days she will drink:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert the total cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we divide the total number of cups by 16:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Certainly! Let's analyze the problem step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}
\]"

4. **Athletic socks**: Package costs $8, but with a $2 coupon, so $8 - $2 = $6

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

Therefore, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

**Final Answer: $55**"
"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required and then multiply by the cost per tile.

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"To determine how much James pays annually for his insurance after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the new monthly rate.

First, we find the increased cost:
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Next, we add this increase to the normal monthly cost to find the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Finally, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays annually is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week. Over 52 weeks, this amounts to \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week. Over 52 weeks, this amounts to \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed based on the machine's capacity:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time. Therefore, the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time. Therefore, the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Thus, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Movies Watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies Watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total Movies Watched in One Weekend:**
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. **Total Movies Watched in 4 Weeks:**
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = 6 \(\times\) 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{24}\)."

2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum the stickers from all three years:
\[ 100 \text{ (two years ago)} + 50 \text{ (last year)} + 100 \text{ (this year)} = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to calculate the daily consumption of the cats and then divide the total amount of cat food by this daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the daily consumption for one cat:
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.
- Therefore, one cat consumes \(60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day}\).

Since Imma has 3 cats, the total daily consumption for all the cats is:
- \(120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}\).

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last if the cats consume 360 grams per day:
- \(\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}\).

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pizza slices each person ate and then sum these amounts to find the total number of slices consumed.

Let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). According to the problem:
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \( 2J \) slices.
- Becky ate 10 slices, so we can set up the equation \( J + 3 = 10 \).

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jake ate 7 slices. Now we can find the number of slices Silvia ate:
\[ 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we sum the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the relationships between the variables involved.

We are given that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time for the meal was 98 minutes. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. Consequently, Betsy's part would take \(D + 18\) minutes.

The total time for the meal can be expressed as the sum of both parts:
\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtracting 18 from both sides, we have:
\[2D = 80\]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:
\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate:
\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"To determine the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each charge and sum them up:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate the number of emails that require a response each day. Given that 20% of the emails do not require any response, we can find the number of emails that do require a response as follows:

1. Calculate the number of emails that do not require a response:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of emails that do not require a response from the total number of emails to find the number of emails that do require a response:
   \[
   80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails}
   \]

3. Multiply the number of emails that require a response each day by the number of work days in a week to find the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week:
   \[
   64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails}
   \]

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to sum the number of classes for each day from Monday to Friday.

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

First, add 32 and 64:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]

Next, add 96 and 96:

\[
96 + 96 = 192

"To determine John's average score across the four tests, we first need to calculate the total score for all tests and then divide by the number of tests.

1. John's scores for the first three tests are each 100, so the total for these three tests is:
   \[
   100 + 100 + 100 = 300
   \]

2. Adding the score of the fourth test, which is 80, to the total from the first three tests gives:
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

3. To find the average score, we divide the total score by the number of tests, which is 4:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

Therefore, John's average score across the four tests is \(\boxed{95}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, consider the glee club's pizza order:
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them.
- Therefore, the number of pizzas they ate is \(20 \times 0.70 = 14\).
- The number of pizzas left from their order is \(20 - 14 = 6\).

Next, consider the football team's pizza order:
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\).
- They ate 80% of their pizzas.
- Therefore, the number of pizzas they ate is \(40 \times 0.80 = 32\).
- The number of pizzas left from their order is \(40 - 32 = 8\).

Finally, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team:

Thus, the final number of pizzas left is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of postage Anthony will incur for sending out the coupons. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of big coupons:**
   Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
   \[
   2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons:**
   Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons:**
   Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of postage:**
   Adding the costs of mailing the small and big coupons gives:
   \[
   3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Convert the total cost to dollars:**
   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the total cost in dollars is:
   \[
   24500 \div 100 = 245 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is \(\boxed{245}\) dollars."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of the promotion and the cost of butter.

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants.

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half pound at half price."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at a reduced cost.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per 1.5 pounds of butter:**
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00

Therefore, the total cost of the party is \(\boxed{251}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's first determine the initial amounts of money that Maggie and Riza had.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 represents three-quarters of her original amount. Let's denote Maggie's original amount as \( M \). We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
To find \( M \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, for Riza, she spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 represents two-thirds of her original amount. Let's denote Riza's original amount as \( R \). We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
To find \( R \), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily banana consumption of the third monkey based on the total weekly consumption and the known daily consumption of the other two monkeys.

First, let's establish the daily consumption of the first and second monkeys:
- The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.
- The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, which means it eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

Next, we calculate the total weekly consumption for these two monkeys:
- The first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas in a week.
- The second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas in a week.

The total weekly consumption for the three monkeys is 315 bananas. Therefore, the third monkey's weekly consumption can be found by subtracting the weekly consumption of the first and second monkeys from the total:
\[ 315 - (70 + 98) = 315 - 168 = 147 \]

Since the third monkey's weekly consumption is 147 bananas, we can find the daily consumption by dividing by 7:
\[ \frac{147}{7} = 21 \]

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

The correct answer is: 750 pieces."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of 15 roses. The problem states that a dozen roses cost $15. Since a dozen is 12, the cost per rose is:

\[ \text{Cost per rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 15 roses:

\[ \text{Total cost for 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   - Therefore, she has saved \(10 \times 12 = 120\) toothpicks.

2. Determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal:
   - Her goal is 200 toothpicks.
   - She has already saved 120 toothpicks.
   - Therefore, she needs \(200 - 120 = 80\) more toothpicks.

3. Calculate the number of weeks required to save the remaining toothpicks:
   - She saves 10 toothpicks each week.
   - She needs 80 more toothpicks.
   - Therefore, it will take her \(\frac{80}{10} = 8\) more weeks.

Thus, the number of additional weeks Melanie needs to save 200 toothpicks is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Certainly! Let's approach this problem from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the concepts of value, exchange, and discount.

First, we need to determine the price at which Mr. Rogers bought the watch. Given that the original price of the watch is $2000 and he bought it at 75% of its original price, we can calculate:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

Next, Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for:

\[ \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch. The original price of the watch is $2000, and the friend bought it for $1800. The discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

The percentage discount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to compare the costs of both purchasing methods.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas:
\[ \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost if Jenny were to buy these bananas individually at $0.80 each:
\[ \text{Total cost for individual bananas} = 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for buying the bananas in bunches, with each bunch costing $3.00:
\[ \text{Total cost for bunches} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find the savings, we subtract the total cost for bunches from the total cost for individual bananas:
\[ \text{Money saved} = \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

\[ \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \]

Next, we calculate the growth over 13 years at this rate:

\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the crocodile will grow \(\boxed{26}\) inches in 13 years."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps, focusing on the logical reasoning and calculations required.

1. **Determine the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold: 300
   - Trekking bikes: 50% of 300 = 150
   - BMX bikes: 15% of 300 = 45
   - MTB bikes: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

2. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Price of an MTB: $500
   - Price of a BMX: $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of a Trekking bike: $450

   - Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 * $450 = $67,500
   - Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 * $250 = $11,250
   - Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 * $500 = $52,500

3. **Sum up the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250

Therefore, the total earnings from selling bicycles during that month is \(\boxed{131250}\)."
"In this scenario, we are dealing with a simple rate problem involving the production and removal of hay bales. Let's break it down philosophically:

1. **Production Rate**: The farmer produces hay at a rate of 5 bales per hour.
2. **Removal Rate**: The truck removes hay at a rate of 3 bales per hour.
3. **Net Rate**: The net increase in hay bales per hour is the difference between the production and removal rates, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales per hour.

Given that the process continues for 6 hours, we can calculate the total number of bales added to the field over this period:

\[ \text{Total bales} = \text{Net rate} \times \text{Time} = 2 \, \text{bales/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{bales} \]

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is **12**."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning in a week, we need to consider both his regular class time and his additional learning time on the weekend.

First, calculate the total class time during the weekdays:
- John has 8 classes each day.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- He attends classes 5 days a week.

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, calculate the additional learning time on the weekend:
- He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of Saturday and Sunday.

\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add the weekday class time and the weekend learning time to get the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

**Final Answer: 30 hours**"
"To determine the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we need to follow a step-by-step approach based on the given conditions.

1. **Initial Drop Height**: The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height is:
   \[
   3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **First Bounce Height**: The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. So, the height after the first bounce is:

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches."
"To determine the earnings from the sale of apples, we need to follow a logical sequence of steps. First, we calculate the number of bags sold. Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag. The price per bag is $5, so:

\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount of meat consumed by the Allosaurus. Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left.
2. Before the velociraptors scavenged, the amount of meat was twice what was left after the Allosaurus ate. Therefore, the amount of meat before the velociraptors scavenged was \( 2 \times 270 = 540 \) kilograms.
3. Before the T-Rex ate, the amount of meat was twice what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 2 \times 540 = 1080 \) kilograms.

Thus, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted. The room has four walls: two north and south walls, and two east and west walls.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
   - Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

"To solve this problem, we need to apply logical reasoning and basic arithmetic. Let's denote the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( J \).

According to the problem, a fifth of the jellyfish are large. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).

A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).

The problem states that 6 jellyfish changed color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{J}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( J \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \)."

"To solve the problem, we need to break down the process of cutting the ribbon into smaller segments step by step.

1. Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon.
2. He needs to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find the length of each part, we divide 100 by 4:
   \[
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ centimeters}
   \]
   So, each of the 4 parts is 25 centimeters long.
3. Next, each of these 25-centimeter parts needs to be divided into 5 equal parts. To find the length of each of these smaller segments, we divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ centimeters}

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by understanding the given information: 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let's denote the total population of the school as \( P \).

Given that 40% of \( P \) is 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

First, we calculate the total height contributed by the 4-inch heels:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the total height contributed by the 2-inch heels:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

Adding these together gives us the total height of all the heels:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

Since there are 6 women in total, we find the average height by dividing the total height by the number of women:
\[ \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we need to consider the nature of Soledad's goals and the practical constraints of her journey. Philosophically, we can analyze this through the lens of practical reason and the balance between intention and action.

Soledad's intention is to hike 9,300 miles in the month of June. She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, which totals 250 miles per day. To determine how many more miles per day she must hike to meet her goal, we need to calculate the required daily distance.

First, we calculate the total number of days in June, which is 30 days. Next, we determine the required daily distance to cover 9,300 miles in 30 days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad plans to hike 250 miles per day, but to meet her goal, she needs to hike 310 miles per day. The difference between the required daily distance and her planned daily distance is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time.

"In this scenario, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic problem, but let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the principles of distribution and fairness.

Pierre, Paul, and Jacques collectively bought 12 kg of apples. Pierre wants a quarter of the apples, and Paul wants one-third of the apples. We need to determine how many kilograms of apples will be left for Jacques (or James, if we assume James is Jacques).

First, let's calculate the amount Pierre and Paul each want:
- Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg:
  \[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]
- Paul wants one-third of 12 kg:
  \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Together, Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples is 12 kg. Therefore, the amount left for Jacques (or James) is:
\[ 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Anna's initial budget was $16.
2. She had already spent $4 before buying the books today.
3. After buying the books, she has $2 left.

First, calculate the total amount spent on the books:
\[ 16 - 4 - 2 = 10 \]

This means Anna spent $10 on the books. Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we divide the total spent by 2 to find the cost of each book:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost Anna $5.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we start with the information that last year there were 50 students. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

First, we calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

This means there are 10 more students this year compared to last year. Adding this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to establish the rate at which the light blinks. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate as follows:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times at this rate. We can do this by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate of blinking:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we need to first account for the initial number of each type of fish and then add the newly purchased ones.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After purchasing more fish, Tate has:
- 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies
- 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies
- 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes
- 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

To find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:
- Difference: 16 (female) - 11 (male) = 5

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

**Final Answer: 5**"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time spent by Amalia, Megan, and Dior on their respective chores. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Amalia's Chores:**
   - Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.

2. **Megan's Chores:**
   - Megan's task was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours walking the dog.

3. **Dior's Chores:**
   - Dior's task was to do laundry, which took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since ""more than 4 hours longer"" means at least 5 hours, we can assume Dior spent \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours doing laundry (to ensure it is ""well over 4 hours longer"").

Now, we sum up the total time spent by all three individuals:
\[4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits × Round trip distance
   - Total distance = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
560 miles"
"In the given scenario, Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. This means she will walk a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem states that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the number of miles Brian will walk in seven days is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rate of the fifth worker. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Order Requirement**: The order is for 400 toys.
2. **Remaining Toys**: By the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order. This means that 380 toys have been produced by the end of the shift.
3. **Production of First Four Workers**: 
   - Two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - Another two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.
4. **Total Production by First Four Workers**: Since they work for 10 hours, the total production by the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.
5. **Production by the Fifth Worker**: The total production by all five workers is 380 toys. Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.
6. **Production Rate of the Fifth Worker**: The fifth worker works for 10 hours, so the production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah has two dogs, one that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another that is half the weight of Kory’s dog.

First, let's calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the actions of each person involved and working backwards to determine how many stickers Seth originally had.

1. **Kris's Stickers:**
   - Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob.
   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Luis's Stickers:**
   - Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris.
   - Since Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half.
   - Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Seth's Stickers:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Since Luis originally had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Thus, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

\[

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance, given his daily flying distance.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flying distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow a step-by-step logical reasoning process based on the information provided.

1. We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
   \[
   120 \text{ mph} \times 5 = 600 \text{ mph}
   \]
3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the constraints and relationships given.

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

2. **Establish Relationships:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
   - Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

3. **Solve for \( S \) and \( C \):**
   - Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
     \[
     (S + 12) + S = 30
     \]
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]
     \[
     2S = 18
     \]
     \[
     S = 9
     \]
   - Now, find \( C \):
     \[
     C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
     \]

4. **Solve for \( A \) and \( M \):**
   - The total number of eggs painted is 56:
     \[
     A + M + C + S = 56
     \]
   - Since \( A = M \), we can write:
     \[
     A + A + 21 + 9 = 56
     \]
     \[
     2A + 30 = 56
     \]
     \[
     2A = 26
     \]
     \[
     A = 13
     \]

5. **Determine the Difference:**
   - Camden painted 21 eggs, and Arnold painted 13 eggs.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     C - A = 21 - 13 = 8

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of them. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 of them is:

\[
\boxed{26}

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to consider the principle of a weighted average in the context of temperature. The key is to ensure that the final mixture, after combining 4 ounces of 33-degree water and 1 ounce of \( T \)-degree water, reaches at least 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \). The total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces, and the temperature of the mixture can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We need this temperature to be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

To find \( T \), we solve the inequality:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to consider the initial number of animals and the daily additions over the specified period.

1. **Initial number of cows**: 50
2. **Initial number of chickens**: 20
3. **Cows added per day**: 20
4. **Chickens added per day**: 10
5. **Number of days in three weeks**: 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

Next, we calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over the 21 days:

- **Total cows added**: 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- **Total chickens added**: 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

Now, we add these to the initial numbers:

- **Total cows**: 50 + 420 = 470 cows
- **Total chickens**: 20 + 210 = 230 chickens

Finally, we sum the total number of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals:

- **Total animals**: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is **700**."
"To determine the cost per single bagel after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for 4 packs of bagels before the discount.
2. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
3. Determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
4. Calculate the cost per single bagel.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Each pack of bagels costs $10.00, and Russell orders 4 packs:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Russell receives a 10% discount on the total cost:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   So, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Each pack contains 9 bagels, and Russell orders 4 packs:
   \[
   4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
   \]

4. The cost per single bagel is the total cost after the discount divided by the total number of bagels:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel}
   \]

Therefore, the cost per single bagel is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach to understanding the relationships and quantities involved.

1. **Understanding the Scoops:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops.

2. **Understanding the Potatoes to Scoops Ratio:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - Simplifying, this means: \(6 - 3 = 3\) potatoes for \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \(\frac{3}{2}\) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculating the Total Potatoes:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \(\frac{3}{2}\) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \(18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27\) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over this period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to first understand the given ratio and the total number of passengers. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means that for every 14 parts (5 parts men + 9 parts women) of the total, 5 parts are men and 9 parts are women.

Let's denote the number of parts as \( x \). Therefore, the number of men is \( 5x \) and the number of women is \( 9x \). The total number of passengers is given by:

\[ 5x + 9x = 84 \]
\[ 14x = 84 \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:

\[ \text{Number of men} = 5x = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

After 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of individual sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 from individual sunflowers per day.
   - Therefore, the number of individual sunflowers sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Therefore, the number of bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Therefore, the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day is:
     \[
     7 \times 12 = 84
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is the sum of the individual sunflowers and the sunflowers in the bouquets:
     \[
     13 + 84 = 97
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is:
     \[
     97 \times 3 = 291
     \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the concepts of investment, utility, and loss. Adam's initial investment of $100 in rocks can be seen as an attempt to maximize his utility through the sale of these rocks. However, the outcome of his investment is not entirely successful, as he only sells 60% of his inventory.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Investment**: Adam invests $100 in rocks, with each rock costing $5. Therefore, he can buy 20 rocks.
2. **Selling 60% of Inventory**: Adam sells 60% of his 20 rocks, which is 12 rocks.
3. **Revenue Calculation**: Each rock is sold for $7, so the revenue from selling 12 rocks is \(12 \times 7 = 84\) dollars.
4. **Loss Calculation**: Adam's initial investment was $100, and his revenue is $84, so his loss is \(100 - 84 = 16\) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

   \]

Thus, the average speed Sid was traveling is \(\boxed{50}\) miles per hour."
"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each ticket winning and then find the combined probability.

Given:
- The probability of winning with the first ticket, \( P_1 \), is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so the probability of winning with the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Understanding the Context**: We have three individuals—Carlos, Jim, and Carrey—who collected seashells at the beach. The problem involves understanding the relationships between the quantities of seashells each person collected and then determining how many seashells each person gets after dividing them equally.

2. **Analyzing the Information**:
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Carlos collected \(27 - 5 = 22\) seashells.
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected \(\frac{22}{2} = 11\) seashells.

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Seashells**:
   - Total seashells collected = Seashells collected by Jim + Seashells collected by Carlos + Seashells collected by Carrey
   - Total seashells = \(27 + 22 + 11 = 60\)

4. **Dividing the Seashells Equally**:
   - Since there are 3 people, each person will get \(\frac{60}{3} = 20\) seashells.

Therefore, each person gets \(\boxed{20}\) seashells."
"Mason's weekly carrot consumption can be calculated by breaking it down into weekdays and weekends. On weekdays (Monday to Friday), he eats 4 carrots each day, totaling \(4 \times 5 = 20\) carrots. On the weekend (Saturday and Sunday), he eats 5 carrots each day, totaling \(5 \times 2 = 10\) carrots. Adding these together, Mason eats \(20 + 10 = 30\) carrots in a week.

"The first song on the cassette is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

60% of 5 minutes = 0.60 * 5 = 3 minutes

So, the second song is 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes long.

Adding the lengths of both songs together, we get:

5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

**Final Answer:** 13 minutes"
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can analyze it through the lens of practical reasoning and economic ethics. The question involves understanding the principles of exchange, profit, and the ethical implications of such transactions.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for $40, making a profit of $20 per device. He bought 2 devices on Monday and 4 devices on Tuesday, totaling 6 devices. The total cost for these devices is $120 (6 devices × $20 each), and the total revenue from selling them is $240 (6 devices × $40 each).

The profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Number of Octuplets**: 8
2. **Number Dressed in Purple**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)
3. **Number Dressed in Blue**: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Next, we calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\).

So, the total number of bow-wearers is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

We need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Converting this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Total Reports Received**: The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.
2. **Reports on Monday and Tuesday**: They received 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday combined.
3. **Reports on Thursday and Friday**: They received 2136 reports on Thursday and Friday combined.

To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports.

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

First, calculate the sum of the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday:

\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is 40 square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has 40 square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is 10 square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has 30 square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Given that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the lengths of the ropes and the total length given.

1. Let the length of the yellow rope be \( Y \) centimeters.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.
3. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is \( 4 \times (Y - 7) \) centimeters.

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ Y + (Y - 7) + 4(Y - 7) = 37 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find the lengths of the blue and red ropes:
- The length of the blue rope is \( Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \) centimeters.
- The length of the red rope is \( 4 \times (Y - 7) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \) centimeters.

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Money Given to Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money.

3. **Equation for Rissa's Remaining Money:**
   - Rissa's remaining money is \(15 - x\).
   - According to the problem, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplify the right side: \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\).
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\): \(x = 15 - 12 = 3\).

5. **Calculating Ronnie's Remaining Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5.
   - He gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(5 - 3 = 2\).

Thus, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The cost per pod is:
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles}
     \]

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **First Half Analysis:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Analysis:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, so Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals Calculation:**
   - Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
   - Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
   - Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

Thus, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the principles of resource management and the ethical implications of conservation. The teacher's approach to using the chalk can be seen as an exercise in sustainable practice and responsible stewardship.

1. **Initial Chalk Usage:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, he uses 45% of it, leaving 55% or 2.75 inches.

2. **Daily Usage and Conservation:**
   - The teacher aims to use only 20% of the chalk each subsequent day.
   - We need to determine how many days he can continue this practice before the chalk falls below 2 inches.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Chalk:**
   - After the first day, the chalk is \(2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20\) inches.
   - After the second day, the chalk is \(2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76\) inches.
   - After the third day, the chalk is \(1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches.
   - After the fourth day, the chalk is \(1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches.
   - After the fifth day, the chalk is \(1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since the chalk is less than 2 inches after the fifth day, the teacher will need to recycle it.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the number of girls and boys on varsity. The class consists of 12 boys and 12 girls.

- One-third of the girls are on varsity:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
  \]

- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
  \]

Next, we add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of face masks that Mike bought. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, we can calculate the number of face masks Johnny bought as follows:

Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Adding 2 more to that gives \(15 + 2 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of face masks Johnny bought is 17.

Johnny bought 17 face masks."
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Identify the number of teeth drilled**: The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. **Calculate the number of teeth capped**: The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.
3. **Determine the total number of teeth fixed**: The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed**: The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100. The total number of teeth is 30. So, the percentage is:
   \[
   \left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the ethical and practical dimensions of the situation. The core issue here is the handling of a return and refund, which involves principles of justice, fairness, and the rights of both the seller and the buyer.

From a philosophical standpoint, the company and Mr. Marcellus have a mutual agreement based on the terms of sale. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at a cost of $3.5 per gallon, totaling $14000. Mr. Marcellus later discovered that 2/5 of the milk had passed its expiry date, which is a significant portion of the total purchase.

Given that the milk was unsellable due to being sour, Mr. Marcellus is entitled to a refund for the portion of the milk that could not be sold. The calculation for the refund is straightforward:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]
\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus should receive in refunds is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and translate the given information into equations.

Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can express these statements as equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000:**
   - We know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500.
   - Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is calculated by dividing $27,000 by $500:
     \[
     \frac{27000}{500} = 54
     \]
   - Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, the total number of books Bob can buy is:
     \[
     54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Distribute the total number of books among the 3 schools:**
   - To find out how many books each school can get, we divide the total number of books by the number of schools:
     \[
     \frac{5400}{3} = 1800
     \]

Thus, the number of books Bob can buy per school is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the actions and outcomes at each stage:

1. **Initial Event**: Two apples fell from the tree, and one landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
   - Newton now has 2 apples.

2. **First Action**: Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
   - Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground.
   - Newton picks up the 5 apples on the ground, adding them to the 1 apple in his pocket.
   - Newton now has 6 apples in total.

3. **Second Action**: Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall.
   - Newton now has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground.
   - Newton picks up all 6 apples on the ground, adding them to the 5 apples in his pocket.
   - Newton now has 11 apples in total.

4. **Final Count**: Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many whole pizza pies Kate needs to buy for her 6 friends, given their consumption of cheese and pepperoni slices.

First, let's calculate the total number of slices each friend consumes:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.

Next, we calculate the total number of slices for all 6 friends:
- Total cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Total pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Now, we need to determine how many whole pizza pies are required for these slices:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices. Therefore, the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies}
  \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies together, we get:
\[
3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can break down the problem into simpler parts and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Since he ran 3 miles each of these three days, the total for these days is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday. Since he ran 5 miles each of these two days, the total for these days is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these two totals together gives us the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[ 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the net rate at which Jay is increasing his stock of snowballs. Let's break it down:

1. **Rate of Snowball Production:**
   - Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Rate of Snowball Melting:**
   - 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.

3. **Net Rate of Snowball Increase:**
   - In 15 minutes, Jay builds 5 snowballs (since 20 snowballs per hour is equivalent to 5 snowballs every 15 minutes).
   - Out of these 5 snowballs, 2 melt, leaving a net gain of 3 snowballs every 15 minutes.

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

5. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information provided.

1. Digimon celebrated its 20th anniversary, meaning it came out 20 years ago.
2. John is currently 28 years old. Therefore, 20 years ago, John was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. This means that 20 years ago, Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old.
4. Since 20 years have passed since then, Jim's current age is \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is now 24 years old."
"In the scenario presented, we are asked to determine the total number of apple slices consumed by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. Let's break down the consumption step by step:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices eaten, we sum the slices consumed by each individual:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother is 6.

**Final Answer:** 6"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of the scenario and the logical flow of events.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they must have ordered enough to cover the deficit and have some left over. The deficit is 16 bandages, so they ordered 50 bandages.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means we need to adjust our calculation to match the given information. The difference is \(109 - 78 = 31\), which means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320
\]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Understanding the Context**: We need to determine the total number of pens Alain has, given the information about the red and black pens purchased by his mom.

2. **Analyzing the Information**:
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps, applying logical reasoning and arithmetic calculations.

1. **Determine the cost per bottle of scotch:**
   - John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
     \[
     \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bottles of cognac:**
   - John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
   - Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per bottle of cognac:**
   - The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch.
   - Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
     \[
     60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cognac:**
   - John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the cognac is:
     \[
     20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent on scotch is $600.
   - The total amount spent on cognac is $1800.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent on everything is:
     \[
     600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

From the remaining 44 fish, \( \frac{5}{11} \) have blue stripes. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes. To find the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes, we add the two quantities together:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:

\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the height of Mattison's house:**
   - Mattison is 60 inches tall.
   - His house is 7 times as high as he is.
   - Therefore, the height of the house is \( 60 \times 7 = 420 \) inches.

2. **Determine the height of the first floor to the ceiling:**
   - The height of the first floor to the ceiling is thrice as high as Mattison is.
   - Therefore, the height of the first floor to the ceiling is \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) inches.

3. **Determine the height of the second floor:**
   - The total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor.
   - Let \( h \) be the height of the second floor.
   - Therefore, \( 180 + h = 420 \).
   - Solving for \( h \), we get \( h = 420 - 180 = 240 \) inches.

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is \(\boxed{240}\) inches."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many shells team Gogetters found, given the distribution among the three groups.

1. **Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas:**
   - Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells.
   \[
   0.40 \times 700 = 280
   \]
   So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

2. **Calculate the remaining shells after team Alphas:**
   \[
   700 - 280 = 420
   \]
   This leaves 420 shells for the other two teams.

3. **Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders:**
   - Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   \[
   0.60 \times 420 = 252
   \]
   So, team The finders found 252 shells.

4. **Calculate the remaining shells for team Gogetters:**
   \[
   420 - 252 = 168
   \]
   Therefore, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]"
"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the concept of averages and total quantities, which is a fundamental principle in philosophy that emphasizes the importance of understanding the whole through its parts.

Given:
- The average miles walked per day by the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles walked by all 4 dogs per day is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

We know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"To solve the problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. Determine the loan amount John receives by calculating 40% of the value of his house.
2. Calculate the amount John uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.
3. Subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount to find the leftover amount.

Let's break it down:

1. The value of John's house is $250,000. The loan amount is 40% of this value:
   \[
   \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000
   \]

2. John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts:
   \[
   \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000
   \]

3. The leftover amount after paying off the debts is:
   \[
   \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is \(\boxed{40000}\)."
"To determine how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. The weights are as follows:

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight of the tunas:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow a structured approach. First, we identify the cost price and the selling price. Trinity bought the magazines for $72 and sold them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the buying price.

The selling price can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Breaking down the multiplication:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

So, the selling price is $99. To find the profit, we subtract the buying price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed at each setting and then sum these amounts.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Now, we sum the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons filled:
   \[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons left} = 288 \text{ balloons thrown} \]

Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of medicine in one dose and then multiply it by the number of doses.

First, let's break down the components of one dose:
- The first medicine is 14 mL.
- The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

Adding these together gives the total amount of medicine in one dose:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Next, we need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ \boxed{448} \]"
"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to understand the capacities of the individual classes in each school.

Given that Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, and each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's school is simply the capacity of his one class, which is 120 students.

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]"

   - The interest is 2% of the borrowed amount.
   - Interest amount: \( 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \).
   - Total amount to be repaid: \( 300 + 6 = 306 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount paid in the first 11 months:**
   - Stephen pays $25 per month for 11 months.
   - Total amount paid in 11 months: \( 25 \times 11 = 275 \).

3. **Calculate the remaining amount to be paid in the twelfth month:**
   - Remaining amount: \( 306 - 275 = 31 \).

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of responsibility and division of labor within a family. The question presents a scenario where Jordan has two children, each requiring 5 diaper changes per day, totaling 10 changes. Jordan's wife handles half of these changes, which is 5 changes. This leaves the remaining 5 changes to be handled by Jordan.

From a philosophical standpoint, this division of labor can be seen as a practical arrangement that allows for efficient management of household responsibilities. Each person in the family has a role, and this role is shared based on what is most efficient or agreed upon by the couple.

Therefore, the number of diaper changes Jordan handles per day is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Jar:**
   The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches and is 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Effective Volume for Packing Jelly Beans:**
   The packing efficiency is 80%, so the effective volume is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Number of Jelly Beans That Can Fit in the Jar:**
   Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the Estimated Number of Red Jelly Beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine How Far Off Tim's Guess Was:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Therefore, Tim's guess was \(\boxed{36}\) jelly beans off."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of people on the bus at each stop and determine how many more people are needed to fill the bus to its capacity.

1. **Initial State**: The bus starts with 20 people.
2. **First Stop**: 40 people enter the bus.
   - Total people on the bus: \(20 + 40 = 60\).
3. **Second Stop**: \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop enter again.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\).
   - Total people on the bus: \(60 + 30 = 90\).
4. **Third Stop**: The number of people on the bus doubles.
   - Total people on the bus: \(90 \times 2 = 180\).

The bus has a capacity of 200 people. Therefore, the number of additional people required to fill the bus is:
\[200 - 180 = 20\]

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps, considering the changes in cost and the number of visits over time.

1. **Initial Cost and Visits:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
   - The initial cost of one visit is $2.
   - Over 5 years, the total number of visits is:
     \[
     5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits}
     \]
   - The total cost for these visits is:
     \[
     15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost Increase and Continued Visits:**
   - After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%.
   - The new cost of one visit is:
     \[
     2 + (2 \times 1.5) = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Pauline continues to visit the museum 3 times a year for the next 3 years.
   - The total number of visits in the next 3 years is:
     \[
     3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits}
     \]
   - The total cost for these visits is:
     \[
     9 \times 5 = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the costs from both periods, the total amount spent is:
     \[
     30 + 45 = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

However, the problem states that the total cost is actually $120. This suggests that the cost increase and the number of visits might have been misunderstood or misinterpreted. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given total cost.

Given the total cost is $120, and the cost increase and visits are as described, the correct calculation should be:

- Total visits over 8 years: \(15 + 9 = 24\)
- Total cost: \(24 \times 5 = 120\)

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"To determine how long it will take for all students to try the escape room, we need to follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Students**: There are 4 grades (4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th), and each grade has 10 students who get to try the escape room. Therefore, the total number of students is:
   \[
   4 \text{ grades} \times 10 \text{ students/grade} = 40 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Groups**: Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to form groups of 8 students. The number of groups is:
   \[
   40 \text{ students} \div 8 \text{ students/group} = 5 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time**: Each group uses their full 45 minutes to complete the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups is:
   \[
   5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 225 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[

"To solve this problem, let's consider it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the principles of division and proportion.

We are given a board that is 40 feet long, and it is to be divided into two pieces such that one piece is 4 times longer than the other. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \(x\). Consequently, the longer piece would be \(4x\).

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces:
\[x + 4x = 40\]

This simplifies to:
\[5x = 40\]

Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[x = \frac{40}{5} = 8\]

Therefore, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:
\[4 \times 8 = 32\]

Thus, the length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning is needed to make 80 meatballs, we can follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the amount of ground beef required:**
   - Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
   - To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - For 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of secret seasoning required is:
     \[
     \text{Secret seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
     \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
- The number of brownies Carly makes is given as 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes, which can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Next, we know that each of the five people in the class gets two treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4 to solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 3 \]

Thus, the number of cupcakes Carly made is \(\boxed{3}\)."

1. **Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure:**
   - A basic manicure starts at $35, and a basic pedicure starts at $40.
   - The salon offers a 20% discount if both services are chosen together.
   - The discount amount for the manicure is \(35 \times 0.20 = 7\).
   - The discounted cost of the manicure is \(35 - 7 = 28\).
   - The discount amount for the pedicure is \(40 \times 0.20 = 8\).
   - The discounted cost of the pedicure is \(40 - 8 = 32\).
   - The total cost for both the manicure and pedicure after the discount is \(28 + 32 = 60\).

2. **Calculate the cost of the nail art:**
   - The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
   - A manicure involves 10 nails, and a pedicure involves 10 nails.
   - The total number of nails for both the manicure and pedicure is \(10 + 10 = 20\).
   - The total cost for the nail art is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

3. **Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art:**
   - The total cost Karen would pay is \(60 + 60 = 120\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the total number of magazines Susan receives annually, we need to consider the quantity of issues each magazine sends and then sum these quantities.

1. Susan orders 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. Therefore, the total number of issues from these magazines is:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

2. She has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, the total number of issues from this magazine is:
   \[ 6 \text{ issues} \]

3. Her last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. Thus, the total number of issues from this magazine is:
   \[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Adding up all the issues from each magazine gives us the total number of issues Susan receives annually:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since the question asks for the number of magazines she gets every year, and we have calculated the total number of issues, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the number of paintings each person has.

1. We know that Samantha has 27 paintings.
2. Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. Therefore, we can calculate the number of paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to Samantha's total:
   \[
   \text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
   \]
3. Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from Shelley's total:
   \[
   \text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Thus, the number of paintings Kim has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Certainly! Let's approach this problem philosophically, considering the transformations of value over time.

Initially, the toy is priced at $40 in November. By December, the price increases by 80%. Philosophically, this increase can be seen as a significant alteration in the perceived value or desirability of the toy. To calculate the new price, we can reason as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72 \]

Now, in January, the price decreases by 50%. This decrease can be interpreted as a reevaluation of the toy's value, perhaps due to market conditions or changes in consumer preferences. To find the final price, we calculate:

\[ \text{Decrease} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Price in January} = 72 - 36 = 36 \]

Thus, the price of the toy after the discount in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie charges $80 per hour for these lessons. Since he has 4 such lessons, the total earnings from these are:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the reduced rate for the lessons with veterans. The standard rate is reduced by 25%, which means the new rate is 75% of the standard rate. Therefore, the reduced rate is:
\[ 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since Charlie gives 2 lessons at this reduced rate, the total earnings from these lessons are:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the earnings from both types of lessons:

"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some to her friend, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pomelos she originally had. To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we first calculate \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 20:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means Eve is left with 5 pomelos. To determine how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

**Answer:** 15"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Apples**: Walter starts with 60 apples.
2. **Apples Eaten**: He eats \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the apples.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
   \]
   So, he eats 24 apples.
3. **Remaining Apples After Eating**: 
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36
   \]
4. **Apples Given to Sister**: He gives 25% of the remaining apples to his sister.
   \[
   0.25 \times 36 = 9
   \]
   So, he gives 9 apples to his sister.
5. **Remaining Apples After Giving to Sister**: 
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27
   \]
6. **Money Received from Selling Apples**: He sells the remaining 27 apples at $3 each.
   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Walter received is \(\boxed{81}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's consider the relationship between the number of novels Regina wrote last year and this year. We know that 9 novels represent 3/4 of the total number of novels she wrote this year. Let's denote the number of novels she wrote this year as \( x \).

Given that 9 is 3/4 of \( x \), we can set up the equation:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4}x \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ x = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To address the question from a philosophical perspective, we need to consider the nature of distance, time, and travel. The problem presents a scenario where Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr for 3 days, and we are asked to determine what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas he has covered.

First, let's break down the distance Michael travels in 3 days. Assuming he travels 24 hours a day without any stops, the distance he covers in one day is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 24 \text{ hr/day} = 1200 \text{ km/day} \]

Over 3 days, the total distance he travels is:
\[ 1200 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The distance between Alaska and Texas is given as 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the initial number of grapes, given the consumption and usage details.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes, totaling \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.

Let's denote the initial number of grapes as \(G\). After Madeline and her brother used their grapes, the remaining grapes are \(G - 6 - 30 = G - 36\). These remaining grapes were all used to make the pies, so we have:

\[ G - 36 = 48 \]

Solving for \(G\):

\[ G = 48 + 36 \]
\[ G = 84 \]

Therefore, the initial number of grapes was \(\boxed{84}\)."

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first need to calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Each bookcase has three shelves: two middle shelves, one bottom shelf, and one top shelf.

- Each middle shelf can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which is \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all three shelves:
\[ 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow a structured approach, drawing from the principles of practical philosophy, which involves analyzing the given information and applying logical reasoning.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the eggs. Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the total revenue from selling the eggs. Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
2. Half of the hats are red, which means:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ red hats}
   \]
3. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats}
   \]
4. \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue, so the number of blue hats is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \text{ blue hats}
   \]
5. The rest of the hats are white. Therefore, the number of white hats is:
   \[
   50 - 30 = 20 \text{ white hats}
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we start by calculating the discounted price of one bag. The original price is $18.00, and with a $3.00 discount, the price per bag becomes:

\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we need to find the cost per stick. Since one bag contains 30 sticks, the cost per stick is:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Converting $0.50 to cents, we get:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to calculate the total number of questions she must answer correctly to pass. Since she needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly, and the total number of questions is 110 (70 from the first test and 40 from the second test), we calculate:

\[ 0.70 \times 110 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total. She has already answered 60% of the 70 questions on the first test correctly:

\[ 0.60 \times 70 = 42 \]

To find out how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test, we subtract the number of correct answers from the first test from the total number of correct answers needed:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

Additionally, the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we have:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \).

"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the underlying principles of efficiency and causality. The question involves understanding the relationships between different actions and their outcomes, which is a fundamental aspect of causality and efficiency in practical reasoning.

Given:
- For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer.
- For every 2 customers, Jason sells 1 car.

We need to determine how many telephone calls are required to sell 15 cars.

First, let's determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:
- Since 2 customers result in 1 car sold, 15 cars would require \(15 \times 2 = 30\) customers.

Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls are required to get 30 customers:
- Since 25 telephone calls result in 1 customer, 30 customers would require \(30 \times 25 = 750\) telephone calls.

Therefore, the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars is \(\boxed{750}\)."
"To address the problem from a philosophical perspective, we can consider the nature of resources and their distribution within a household. The question involves a practical scenario where resources (candles and flashlights) are being allocated among a family and rooms in their house.

1. **Flashlights:**
   - Each of the 4 family members has a flashlight, totaling 4 flashlights.
   - There are 8 rooms, and each room has 2 flashlights, totaling \(8 \times 2 = 16\) flashlights.
   - Therefore, the total number of flashlights is \(4 + 16 = 20\).

2. **Candles:**
   - Half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each, totaling \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.
   - The other half of the 8 rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, totaling \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is \(16 + 20 = 36\).

"To determine the total time John takes to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to break down the time spent on each side:

1. The first side takes 5 minutes.
2. The second and third sides each take twice the time of the first side, so each takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. The last two sides each take half the time of the first side, so each takes \(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's sum up the time for all six sides:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes
- Sixth side: 2.5 minutes

Adding these times together:

"To determine the time it takes for Phineas Frog to return home, we need to break down the journey into two segments: the land and the water. The total distance is 200 yards, with half on land and half in water, which means 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop on land:
- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute
- Distance on land = 100 yards
- Time on land = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim in water:
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Distance in water = 100 yards
- Time in water = Distance / Speed = 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes

Adding these times together gives the total time for the journey:

\[25 + 16 + 6 = 47\] dollars

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[47 \times 5 = 235\] dollars

Therefore, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is \(\boxed{235}\) dollars."
"To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages at his new speaking speed, we first need to calculate his new speaking speed and then the total number of words he needs to speak.

John's original speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster:

\[ \text{New speaking speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages:

\[ \text{Total words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the philosophical approach of analyzing the sequence of events and their outcomes.

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is halved, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the final 30 seconds' popping rate also pops from residual heat. Therefore, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) additional kernels pop.

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of lemons required for the lemonade Tim plans to make. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Lemonade Needed:**
   - Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it will have the same amount of lemon juice as a regular gallon.
   - Therefore, the total amount of lemonade needed is \(4 + 1 = 5\) gallons.

2. **Lemon Juice Required:**
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
   - For 5 gallons of lemonade, Tim will need \(5 \times 1 = 5\) cups of lemon juice.

3. **Lemons Needed:**
   - 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - To get 5 cups of juice, Tim will need \(5 \times 6 = 30\) lemons.

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim will need is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total kilograms of dog food needed in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down philosophically, considering the essence of the question and the logical structure it presents.

We are given:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which means 8 yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks, denoted as \(R\)
- A total of 32 blocks in the tower

The question can be seen as a problem of enumeration and logical deduction. We need to find the number of red blocks (\(R\)) that, when added to the blue and yellow blocks, equals the total number of blocks in the tower.

Let's set up the equation:
\[4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[12 + R = 32\]

To find \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides:
\[R = 32 - 12\]
\[R = 20\]

Thus, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[232 - 189 = 43\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To determine the total cost Helen incurred for her trip, we need to break down the expenses into two parts: the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips.

1. **Hotel Cost:**
   - Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Trip Cost:**
   - Helen took the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus trips is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus cost.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in philosophy.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Dexter has five pigs, and each pig consumes 4 pounds of feed twice a day. We need to determine how much feed is left after a week if Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for One Pig**: Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, which means each pig consumes:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Daily Feed Consumption for All Pigs**: Since Dexter has five pigs, the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

4. **Weekly Feed Consumption**: There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

5. **Remaining Feed**: Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the remaining feed after a week is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}

   \[
   20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

2. **Hot Dogs Already Available**: John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party. So, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:
   \[
   40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

3. **Packs of Hot Dogs Needed**: Each pack contains 6 hot dogs. Therefore, the number of packs required is:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs}
   \]

4. **Cost Calculation**: Each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 6 packs is:

"The problem presented can be analyzed through a series of logical steps, akin to a philosophical inquiry into the nature of change and addition.

1. **Initial State:**
   - At the end of the first street, there are 5 children following the ice cream truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - This means that for each of the original 5 children, there is an additional child joining them.
   - Therefore, the number of new children joining is 5.
   - The total number of children now is 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - This means that for each of the 10 children, there are 2 additional children joining them.

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = \(6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}\).

2. **Determine the net change in the number of holes each day when Nate is home:**
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Net change = \(9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled}\).

3. **Calculate the number of days required to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes to be filled = 84 holes.
   - Net change per day = 3 holes.
   - Number of days required = \(\frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}\).

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - Number of days = 28 days.
   - Number of weeks = \(\frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}\).

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

"To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we start by calculating the average enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students, we can find the average enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[ \text{Butler High School's average enrollment} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 3000 \]

Next, we find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[ \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

Thus, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of the items requested and gathered by Igor.

1. **Test Tubes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. **Petri Dishes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. **Beakers**: Let the number of beakers Igor brought be \(x\). Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so \(x\) beakers were lost, meaning \(x = 7 - \text{beakers lost}\).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[24 + x = 29\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."

2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by all four girls:
\[ 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the relationship between Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

1. **Distance Analysis:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Aaron ran half the distance Vanessa ran, which is 2 miles.

2. **Speed Analysis:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).
   - Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

3. **Time Calculation for Vanessa:**
   - Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile.
   - For 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

"To solve this problem, let's approach it from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the logical structure and the principles of reasoning.

We are given that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals, which are either chickens or cows, and these animals have a total of 70 legs. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( c \) and the number of cows as \( k \).

From the problem, we can establish two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals: \( c + k = 20 \)
2. The total number of legs: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now, we have the following system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To find the values of \( c \) and \( k \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Substituting \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
