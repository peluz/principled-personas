**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"
"James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. Therefore, in one session, he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

Since he runs 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

Thus, the total meters James runs a week is:
\[ \boxed{540} \]"
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens.
2. Determine the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we calculate the total daily feed requirement for all chickens:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for 16 glasses, where the first glass costs $5 and every second glass costs 60% of $5, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The cost of the first glass is $5.
2. The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = $3\).

This pattern continues, so for every pair of glasses, the total cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many pairs of glasses there are: \(16 \div 2 = 8\) pairs.

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair: \(8 \times 8 = $64\).

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses.

**Final Answer:**
$64"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.

1. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston is \(4 \times 20 = 80\).

3. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse is \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

4. **Total Sheep:**
   - The total number of sheep is the sum of the sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.
   - Total sheep = \(160 + 80 + 20 = 260\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To determine the total time it takes for Carla to download the file, we need to break down the process into several steps.

1. **Calculate the size of the file at 40%:**
   - 40% of 200 GB = \(0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}\)

2. **Calculate the time to download 80 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

3. **Add the 20 minutes for the Windows update restart:**
   - Total time so far = \(40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the remaining size of the file:**
   - Remaining size = \(200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB}\)

5. **Calculate the time to download the remaining 120 GB at 2 GB/minute:**
   - Time = \(\frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)

6. **Calculate the total time to download the entire file:**
   - Total time = \(60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   - He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered during this time.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular earnings and her overtime earnings separately, then sum them up.

1. **Regular Earnings:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Earnings:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are \(\boxed{460}\)."
"In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
\[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]

In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, so the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
\[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

The total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"To find the total cost of the pastries Toula bought, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry and then sum them up.

   - Total cost for donuts = \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - The cost per dozen is $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the total costs for each type of pastry to get the overall total cost:

\[
204 + 160 + 330 = 694
\]

Therefore, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners there. This means she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. According to the problem, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left after the orange house sale. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

So, Melanie started with \(\boxed{18}\) vacuum cleaners."
"To solve this problem, we start by determining the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Given that 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of students remaining after the contemporary dance enrollment:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Now, we calculate the number of students left to enroll in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Thus, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[ \boxed{60\%} \]"

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

The problem states that one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars} \]

It is also given that the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars."
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age now is 162, we can set up the following equations to find their current ages.

Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\). The sum of their ages is given by:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]
\[18x = 162\]
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Gunter's friends made the following guesses:
1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first guess, which is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \).
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \).

To find the average of these guesses, we sum them up and divide by the number of guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.
2. Multiply the daily care hours by the number of days in a week.

Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to walk and take care of their business. John takes care of 10 dogs, so the total daily care hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, using the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we start by finding out how many jewels Aaron has. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. First, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."
"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find the points scored in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game gives us the total points scored:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
2. Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in the total number of yogurts.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts} \]

Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts.
\[ \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts.
Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, so for 15 sets, the total cost is:
\[ 15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"John sells 13 lego sets for $15 each, so the total amount of money he gets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games for $20 each, spending:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total money he had initially minus the cost of the video games and the leftover money is:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let his speed be \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"Given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can determine her running speed as follows:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, we can find her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Dana spends one-third of her 6-hour period running and two-thirds walking:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she covers while running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Adding these distances gives the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Given the relationships between the ages of the iPhones:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we start by calculating the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:
\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and the calories you have already consumed, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories in the bag of chips:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - There are 5 servings in a 300g bag.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

2. **Determine the calorie content per gram:**
   - Total calories = 1250 calories.
   - Total weight = 300g.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

3. **Calculate the remaining calories you can consume:**
   - Daily calorie target = 2000 calories.
   - Calories already consumed = 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

4. **Determine how many grams you can eat with the remaining calories:**
   - Calories per gram = 4.17 calories/g.
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed:**
   - Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, for 20 candles, Charlie needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Next, we calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Since each article takes 4 hours to research and write, the total number of hours spent writing articles is:
\[ 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package.
2. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
3. After purchasing the package, she had \( 80 + x \) Post-it notes.
4. She used 220 Post-it notes at work, so the number of Post-it notes left is \( 80 + x - 220 \).
5. We know that after using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   x - 140 = 23
   \]
7. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 23 + 140

"John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, calculate the number of blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, determine the number of red ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Calculate the cost of each red tie:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}

"Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary starts with 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of potted plants she already has is:

- Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- History textbook: 7 pages
- Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:

39 - 15 = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed, every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On weekends, he has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which equals 6 glasses of water on the weekends.

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together: 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses of water in a week.

**Final Answer: 26**"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by understanding the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up a proportion to find the time \( x \) it takes to cover 42 miles:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
10 \times 42 = 3 \times x
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Solving for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"Poppy starts with 1000 pieces. She places a quarter of them on the board, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \]

After placing 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are:

\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \]

Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \]

After her mom places 250 pieces, the number of pieces left to be placed is:

\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[ \boxed{500} \]"

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to determine the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) gives us the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up an equation based on the total hours of TV he watched throughout the week.

Frankie's TV watching schedule:
- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night, so \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- Wednesday: \(0.5x\) hours, where \(x\) is the number of 30-minute episodes.
- Thursday: 1 hour and 30 minutes, so \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday: 2 hours (two 1-hour episodes).

The total hours of TV watched is 7 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \( x \).

This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \). However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \). According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 50 \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let's denote the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold as \( B \) and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as \( D \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
2. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
3. Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we express the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phone capacities:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Brittany's phone capacity and the number of ducks:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"First, calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha originally bought.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- She bought ten of these boards at $10 each.
- Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $10 = $100.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- She bought five of these boards at $16 each.
- Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $16 = $80.

So, the total cost of all the lumber is:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

Next, calculate the total selling price of the lumber.

For the 2x4x10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $10 * 1.5 = $15.
- Total selling price for 2x4x10 boards = 10 * $15 = $150.

For the 4x4x10 boards:
- The price has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is $16 * 1.5 = $24.
- Total selling price for 4x4x10 boards = 5 * $24 = $120.

So, the total selling price of all the lumber is:
- Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

Finally, calculate the profit:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Given that Katy uses sugar and water in the ratio of 7:13, we can represent the amount of sugar and water she uses as \(7x\) and \(13x\) respectively, where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

The total amount of sugar and water used is given as 120 teaspoons. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, we need to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, which is represented by \(7x\). Substituting the value of \(x\), we get:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used is:

\[\boxed{42}\]"

Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \).
   - Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = 30,769.23 \) (approximately).

2. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - Four years later, his salary increased by 40%.
   - Therefore, Adrien's current salary is \( 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \).

3. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.
   - Assuming Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's (40%), her current salary is \( 30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \) (approximately).

4. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   - Adrien's current salary is $56,000.
   - Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92.

\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]
Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]
Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete is:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Adding the incomplete questions from both tests gives:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Given that there are 12 blue gumballs and the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( B \) be the number of blue gumballs and \( P \) be the number of pink gumballs. We know \( B = 12 \) and the relationship between pink and blue gumballs is given by:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substituting \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. Given that there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is:
20%"
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).
2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

First, substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. To find out how many hours he plays in one week, we calculate:

\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job. Therefore, if he spent those 14 hours working instead of playing video games, his earnings would be:

\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140/\text{week} \]

So, Jordan would earn \(\$140\) in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."
"John buys the following items:
- Milk for $2 (food item)
- Eggs for $3 (food item)
- Light bulbs for $3 (non-food item)
- Cups for $3 (non-food item)
- Roach traps for $4 (non-food item)

First, calculate the total cost of the non-food items:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, apply the 10% tax on the non-food items:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, the total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the food items:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the cost of the food items and the non-food items after tax to get the total cost:
\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses.

First, let's find the total number of clients:
\[ 3 \text{ (existing clients)} + 5 \text{ (potential clients)} = 8 \text{ clients} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of supplies for each client:
\[ 2 \text{ bottles of bleach} \times \$2 \text{ per bottle} + 1 \text{ pack of cloths} \times \$5 \text{ per pack} = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \]

Now, we find the total expenses for all clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times \$9 \text{ per client} = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as \$92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, with 100 pineapples per hectare. He can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we can follow these steps:

   \[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \]

2. Determine the total number of pineapples per hectare harvested in a year:
   \[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

3. Calculate the number of harvests John can make in a year:
   \[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

4. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:
   \[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ \boxed{4000} \]"
"Johnny has three Lego sets to pick up. The first set contains 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, which means it has \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which means it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:

\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

Therefore, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is \(\boxed{2125}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First 6 hours**: 30 bees leave the hive.
2. **Next 6 hours**: \( \frac{1}{2} \) of 30 bees return. So, \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) bees return.
3. **Following 6 hours**: Twice as many bees as left in the first 6 hours leave. So, \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees leave.
4. **Last 6 hours**: All the bees that left in the first 12 hours (30 + 60 = 90) return to the hive.

So, in the last 6 hours, 90 bees return to the hive.

**Final Answer:**

"Let's denote the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \(D\).

Given that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
\[3D = 12\]

Solving for \(D\), we divide both sides by 3:
\[D = \frac{12}{3} = 4\]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has can be calculated as:
\[4D = 4 \times 4 = 16\]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer:

"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

First, convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"To determine how much Shawnda made from her bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then convert that into dollars.

1. **Bicycles**: Each bicycle has 2 tires. Since 5 people came to inflate both tires, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires per bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. **Tricycles**: Each tricycle has 3 tires. Since 3 people came to inflate all their tricycle tires, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires per tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. **Unicycles**: Each unicycle has 1 tire. Since 1 person came to inflate their unicycle tire, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
   \[
   1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire per unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

4. **Total Tires Inflated**: Adding up all the tires inflated:
   \[
   10 \text{ bicycle tires} + 9 \text{ tricycle tires} + 1 \text{ unicycle tire} = 20 \text{ tires}
   \]

5. **Cost per Tire**: Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. Therefore, the total cost in cents is:
   \[
   20 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents per tire} = 500 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Convert to Dollars**: Since 100 cents make 1 dollar, the total cost in dollars is:
   \[
   500 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is:

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Finally, we determine the change Carl receives if he pays with a $10 bill:
\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \$4.00 \]"
"Let's denote the total number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
5. Ants carried off the last remaining fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

We need to work backwards from the end:

- After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left. Before the ants, there were \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) fries.
- Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let \( y \) be the number of fries before the raccoon. The raccoon stole \( \frac{2}{3}y \), leaving \( \frac{1}{3}y = 6 \). So, \( y = 6 \times 3 = 18 \) fries.
- Before the pigeons ate, there were \( 18 + 9 = 27 \) fries.
- Before the seagull ate, there were \( 27 + 7 = 34 \) fries.
- Before Dave ate, there were \( 34 + 14 = 48 \) fries.

Therefore, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \( \boxed{48} \)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate his weekly class hours and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the weekly class hours:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:

1. **Rolls**: 
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Total length of rolls = \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: 
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Total length of croissants = \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes**: 
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches.
   - Total length of baguettes = \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Next, we sum the lengths of all the baked goods in inches:
\[1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}.\]

Finally, we convert the total length from inches to feet:
\[3360 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 280 \text{ feet}.\]

Therefore, the total length of all the baked goods put end to end is \(\boxed{280}\) feet."

"To determine how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we first calculate the total distance each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. The distance for one round trip is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ yards} \]
Thus, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. The distance for one round trip is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ yards} \]
Thus, the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

The difference in the distances they run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner runs \(\boxed{280}\) yards farther than the loser."

"Anakin and Locsin went to the beach today. Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

First, let's calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:
\[ 10 \text{ (starfish)} + 6 \text{ (sea horses)} + 3 \text{ (clownfish)} = 19 \text{ fish} \]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[ 5 \text{ (starfish)} + 3 \text{ (sea horses)} + 5 \text{ (clownfish)} = 13 \text{ fish} \]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin:

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest.

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( \$20 \)
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

2. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

3. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the compound interest formula:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

6. **Multiply the original price by the result:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32
   \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Given:
- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she is purchasing and then subtract this from her budget.

The items and their costs are:
- Computer: €1090
- Screen: €157
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

First, we sum these costs:
\[
1090 + 157 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

Let's break it down step by step:
1. \(1090 + 157 = 1247\)
2. \(1247 + 157 = 1404\)
3. \(1404 + 74 = 1478\)
4. \(1478 + 102 = 1580\)

The total cost of the items is €1580. Elvira's budget is €1500. Since the total cost exceeds her budget, she will not have any money left for clothing. In fact, she will be short by €80.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each flan requires 3 eggs, so for 15 flans, Sandra will need:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Since Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits, we need to find out how many babysitting sessions are required to get 45 eggs. We do this by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:
\[ \frac{45}{9} = 5 \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). This gives us the equation:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   B + S + 4 = 28
   \]
   \[
   B + S = 24
   \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[
B + 2B = 24
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Now, using \( S = 2B \):
\[
S = 2 \times 8 = 16

\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\)."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first calculate her total minimum monthly payment:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find the total amount paid in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12:

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the amount Jessica pays in a year is \(\boxed{18000}\)."

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

First, calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:
\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.05) = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, calculate the annual salary with the raise:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Finally, add the one-time monetary reward to the annual salary:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

**Step 1: Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.**

Josie has 10 acres of land, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

**Step 2: Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.**

Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the cheese consumption for each meal and then sum them up.

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 7 days.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total slices for sandwiches: \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

2. **Omelets:**
   - Carl ate an omelet 3 days a week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.
   - Total slices for omelets: \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Adding these together:
\[14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 31\]

Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\)."

"To find the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 over 6 tests:
   \[
   93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

2. Sum the scores of the first five tests:
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

3. Determine the lowest score among the first five tests:
   \[
   \text{Lowest score} = 71
   \]

4. Calculate the adjusted total score after removing the lowest score:

"To find the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to calculate the distance for each period and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

1. **Weight of Chocolate Bars:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
   - There are 25 chocolate bars.
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = \( 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \).

2. **Weight of Candied Apples:**
   - Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, so each candied apple weighs \( \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \).
   - There are 80 candied apples.
   - Total weight of candied apples = \( 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \).

3. **Total Weight of Joe's Bag of Candy:**
   - Total weight = Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples.
   - Total weight = \( 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \).

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \(\boxed{2600}\) grams."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We do this by adding the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To find the cost of each cup, we start by determining the cost of half a dozen plates. Given that each half dozen plate costs $6000, the total cost for half a dozen plates is $6000.

Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 6000 - 1200 = 4800 \]

Since twenty dozen cups equal 240 cups (20 dozen = 20 * 12 = 240 cups), the cost per cup is:
\[ \frac{4800}{240} = 20 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, with Sara wanting 2 pairs. Therefore, the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars. Adding the cost of the jacket, the total cost is:
\[30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars}\]

Next, we calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are:
\[4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars}\]

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting is:
\[10 + 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}\]

To find out how much more money Sara needs, we subtract the amount she already has from the total cost:
\[70 - 30 = 40 \text{ dollars}\]

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she must mow the lawn to earn the additional $40, we divide the amount needed by the amount earned per mow:
\[40 \div 4 = 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"Let's define the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time \(t\) it takes to walk a certain distance \(d\) at a constant speed \(v\) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Substituting the distance (15 miles) and the speed (3 miles per hour):

\[ t = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Gary spends walking is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers. The total number of customers by the third day was 500. Therefore, the number of customers she counted on the third day is \(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\).

The number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and in the big pool as \( B \) gallons. Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Now, the problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( \boxed{8} \) gallons."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can make her purchase."
"Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. First, we calculate the additional amount:

\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months. The total amount she will pay is:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:

\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"There are 4 roses in the vase. Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are \(4 + 7 = 11\) dahlias. Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

"Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can determine the ages of Adrian and Zack as follows:

1. Harriet's age is half of Zack's age, so Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
2. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

In three years, their ages will be:
- Harriet: \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack: \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian: \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age of the three in three years, we calculate:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Naomi's Points**: Naomi scored 68 points.
2. **Yuri's Points**: Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's points} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. **Brianna's Points**: Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's points} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]
4. **Total Points**: The total points scored by the four students is 251. To find Jojo's points, we subtract the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
   \[
   \text{Jojo's points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54

"To determine the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A, which is 30% of 1000.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after those who went out through exit A.
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C, which is the remaining students after those who went out through exits A and B.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
2. John has twice as many candies as Robert, and we know John has 54 candies. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   2R = 54
   \]
3. Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]
   So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert. Therefore, the number of candies James has is:
   \[
   J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
   \]
5. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we calculate the difference:
   \[
   54 - 33 = 21
   \]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"Mike was a pen pal with 5 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them. They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 6 minutes. We need to find out how many hours he spends writing a week.

1. **Number of pen pals left**: Mike is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.
2. **Letters sent and received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, so the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters. Since he responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.
3. **Total pages written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.
4. **Time spent writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.
5. **Convert minutes to hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

The final answer is \(\boxed{3.6}\) hours."
"Jason has a monthly phone plan of 1000 minutes. He makes a 15-minute call with his boss every day for 30 days, which totals to \(15 \times 30 = 450\) minutes. Additionally, he used 300 extra minutes for other calls. Therefore, the total minutes used this month is \(450 + 300 = 750\) minutes. Subtracting this from his monthly plan, Jason has \(1000 - 750 = 250\) minutes left.

The final answer is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is \(\boxed{20}\)."

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( \boxed{7} \)."
"To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily cost:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours each day.
   - Daily cost = $250/hour * 6 hours = $1500.

2. **Calculate the weekly cost:**
   - The makeup artist needs to do the makeup 4 times a week.
   - Weekly cost = $1500/day * 4 days = $6000.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the 5 weeks:**
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - Total cost before discount = $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000.

4. **Apply the 10% discount:**
   - The makeup artist gives a 10% discount after the movie is done.
   - Discount amount = 10% of $30000 = 0.10 * $30000 = $3000.
   - Total cost after discount = $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

Therefore, Jean paid \(\boxed{27000}\)."

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each ate over the two days and then convert those into calories.

First, let's find out how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Therefore, Sue's sister ate a total of \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.
- Therefore, Sue ate a total of \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them. Since each cookie has 200 calories:
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:
- The difference is \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed \(\boxed{5600}\) more calories than her sister."

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Last Night's Hunting:**
   - Rick killed 10 wolves.
   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today's Hunting:**
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.

From the information given:
- Let the number of cougars killed today be \(C\).
- Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \(3C\).
- Since Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night, \(C = 15 - 3 = 12\).

So, today:
- Rick killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves.
- Rick killed 12 cougars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals killed over the two days:
- Total wolves: \(10 + 36 = 46\)
- Total cougars: \(15 + 12 = 27\)

Total animals killed = \(46 + 27 = 73\).

"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, so we calculate 30% of 30:
   \[
   30 \times 0.30 = 9
   \]
   Therefore, Anne went down the slide:
   \[
   30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times}
   \]

2. Calculate how many times Robert went down the slide. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down the slide 21 times, Robert went down the slide:

"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. Therefore, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. So, the number of new cows added to each stall is:
\[ \frac{40}{20} = 2 \]

After adding the new cows, each stall now has:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \]

We need to find the number of cows in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall now has 22 cows, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[ 8 \times 22 = 176 \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:

"To find the weight of the redwood after termites ate 30% of it, we start by calculating the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it.

The redwood is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. Therefore, the total number of 10-foot sections in the redwood is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections} \]

Since each section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood before the termites ate any of it is:
\[ 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to determine how much of the redwood was eaten by the termites. The termites ate 30% of the redwood, so the remaining percentage of the redwood is:
\[ 100\% - 30\% = 70\% \]

To find the weight of the remaining redwood, we calculate 70% of the original weight:
\[ 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the weight of the redwood after the termites ate 30% of it is:
\[ \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}} \]"

"To find the total number of windows between the houses, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we start by calculating the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette, and then use the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches for the sleeves.

1. Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

2. Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of stitches for the collar and the rosette:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

4. Calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette} = 900 + 270 = 1170
   \]

5. Calculate the total number of stitches for the sleeves:
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for sleeves} = 1800 - 1170 = 630
   \]

6. Since there are two sleeves, the number of stitches for each sleeve is:
   \[
   \text{Stitches for each sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
   \]

The number of stitches each sleeve takes is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost for both the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum these amounts.

First, calculate the cost for the tomato seeds:
- Number of tomato seed packets: 20
- Cost per packet of tomato seeds: $40
- Total cost for tomato seeds = 20 * $40 = $800

Next, calculate the cost for the celery seeds:
- Number of celery seed packets: 80
- Cost per packet of celery seeds: $30
- Total cost for celery seeds = 80 * $30 = $2400

Now, add the total costs for the tomato seeds and the celery seeds:
- Total cost for tomato seeds: $800
- Total cost for celery seeds: $2400
- Overall total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the lines for each part of the production and then sum them up.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines
     - Second scene: 48 lines
   - Total lines = \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\)

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"To determine how many cards had the letter D on them, we start with the total number of cards, which is 80.

1. Calculate the number of cards with the letter A:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]
So, there are \(80 - 32 = 48\) cards remaining.

2. Calculate the number of cards with the letter B from the remaining cards:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]
This leaves \(48 - 24 = 24\) cards.

3. Calculate the number of cards with the letter C from the remaining cards:
\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the total time for digging the small holes:
   - Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   - Total time for 30 small holes = 30 * 3 = 90 minutes

2. Calculate the total time for digging the large holes:
   - Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
   - Total time for 15 large holes = 15 * 10 = 150 minutes

3. Calculate the total time for both small and large holes:
   - Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours:
   - 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

The final answer is \boxed{4} hours."
"Given that the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, we need to determine the sum of their ages in 10 years.

In 10 years, each of their ages will increase by 10 years. Therefore, the total increase in their combined age will be:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

Adding this increase to their current combined age:
\[ 20 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of spots on a mamba. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:

\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots:

\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"

So, Maddy needs 13 pizzas. Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones.
2. Subtract this length from the total length of the necklace to find the length occupied by the sterling silver beads.
3. Determine how many sterling silver beads fit into the remaining length.

Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and there are 8 topaz gemstones per necklace. Therefore, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. Subtracting the length occupied by the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace gives:
\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inch long. To find out how many sterling silver beads fit into 17 inches, we divide 17 by 1/4:

"Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. First, we calculate the total value of her quarters and dimes in cents.

Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these values together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount of money:

"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

First, calculate the stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, calculate the stars in the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Add these together to find the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \]

The flag has a total of 76 stars. Subtract the 36 stars from the 76 stars to find the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

Now, divide the 40 stars by 5 to find the number of rows of 5 stars:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is:

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:
\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the result is a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

"The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, which is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]

To find the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula for time:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 16 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we calculate:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

So, Izzy has 17 medals. Next, we find the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together:

\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]

The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together. Let \( M \) be the total number of medals given out. Then:

\[ M = 10 \times 39 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:

\[ \boxed{390} \]"

"Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a 30-minute break. The total working time is 3 hours minus 30 minutes, which is 2.5 hours. Converting 2.5 hours to minutes gives us 150 minutes. Since she earns $5 for every 10 minutes, we divide 150 minutes by 10 to find the number of 10-minute intervals: \( \frac{150}{10} = 15 \) intervals. Therefore, her total earnings are \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \) dollars.

The final amount Susan earns for the online task is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"After the first three rounds, the points are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have more than 20 points:
- Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

The total points after the extra points are distributed are:
- Mike: 22 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

Adding these together, the total points are \(22 + 18 + 43 = 83\).

"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day for 5 days a week. His daily earnings are calculated as follows:

\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100/\text{day} \]

His weekly earnings without the bonus are:

\[ \$100/\text{day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the whole month, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings with the bonus are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

"First, calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100/\text{suit} = \$600 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50/\text{suitcase} = \$150 \]

The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 + \$700 = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

The total amount Theo wants to save is $2000. Therefore, the total amount he can spend on the trip is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Now, sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$2050 \]

The amount left for buying gifts is:
\[ \$4000 - \$2050 = \$1950 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend \(\boxed{1950}\) on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa."

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.
   - Therefore, the current population of Chile is \(60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

"Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people
- 3 families with 4 people each: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people

So, the total number of people invited is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Next, we need to account for the people who couldn't come due to illness and those with previous commitments:

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 8 people had previous commitments: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\).

Finally, to find out how many people showed up, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Solomon initially had 50 marbles in the store. He then bought 20 more marbles from his friend Johanna, bringing the total to 70 marbles. His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna, which is \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles. Adding these 8 marbles to the 70 marbles he already had, the total number of marbles Solomon now has is \(70 + 8 = 78\).

Since each marble weighs 2 kilograms, the total weight of the marbles is \(78 \times 2 = 156\) kilograms.

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \(\boxed{156}\) kilograms."
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

   \]

2. The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

3. To find the total number of children in the classroom, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\)."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) people. Therefore, \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) people stayed at the party. Given that 22 men stayed, the number of women who stayed is \( 30 - 22 = 8 \).

The number of women left at the party is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"The book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $4 / 2 = $2. The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

The cost of the pen is $1."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has 26 pencils in total, which includes 2 loose pencils and 3 boxes of pencils. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are distributed equally among 3 boxes, each box contains:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To store all 72 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to calculate the weakening effect from both the ice cubes and the cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

   - The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total payment to junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment for senior programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.
   \[
   \text{Total payment to senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers:**
   - Add the total payment to junior programmers and the total payment to senior programmers.
   \[
   \text{Total payment} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000

"Let's calculate the net pay for both jobs step by step.

**Job A:**
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, we compare the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[ H = 2C \]

3. The total number of animals is 60:
   \[ H + C = 60 \]

4. Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the total number of animals equation:
   \[ 2C + C = 60 \]
   \[ 3C = 60 \]
   \[ C = 20 \]

5. Now, find the number of chickens:

"To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total cost for one person to play one round of mini-golf, ride the go-karts twice, and have $5 in arcade tokens. Then, we will subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for the number of friends.

1. **Cost of mini-golf for one person:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of go-karts for one person (2 rides):**
   \[
   \text{Cost of go-karts} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
   \]

3. **Total cost for one person (including mini-golf and go-karts):**
   \[

   \]

4. **Cost for Morgan herself:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for Morgan} = \$25
   \]

5. **Cost for arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$5
   \]

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, we calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Next, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, calculate the distance Cho hiked:

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy savings when the air conditioner usage is reduced.

First, let's determine the daily energy consumption when the air conditioner is used for 8 hours a day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]
Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the daily energy consumption if the usage is reduced by 5 hours a day, meaning the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, we find the daily savings in energy consumption:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

"First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means that for 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound (since 1/2 off of $3 is $1.50).

So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50 and the magnets cost $0.25 each. Since she bought 4 magnets, the total cost for the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

So, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is:
\[ 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items Sally bought:
\[ 4.50 + 2.50 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, the final amount of money Sally has left is:

"To determine the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars. Therefore, the cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
5. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together, we get:

"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cookies into dozens.

Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode. We are given that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, and the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, meaning 1% of the candles will explode. Additionally, 5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is the product of the probability of a candle smelling like wet dog and the probability of a candle exploding:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 5\% \times 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 0.01 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the discount price of one blouse.
2. Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price.

The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price.

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 4 blouses at the discounted price:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Joanne gathers half this amount from the shortest trees, which is \(30 / 2 = 15\) apples.
3. Let the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees be \(x\).

So, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
\[30 + 15 + x = 45 + x\]

Now, let's consider what Joanne's sister gathers:
1. Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) apples.
2. Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, which is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) apples.
3. Joanne's sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

So, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
\[60 + 45 = 105\]

The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[45 + x + 105 = 500\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[150 + x = 500\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[x = 500 - 150\]
\[x = 350\]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[\boxed{350}\]"
"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we have:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we have:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate each segment of the trip.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 km
   - Number of days: 4
   - Total distance: \(200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}\)

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Total distance: 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days
   - Distance: \(800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}\)

3. **Next day (no travel):**
   - Distance: 0 km

4. **Second week:**
   - Distance per day: 300 km
   - Number of days: 7
   - Total distance: \(300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}\)

Now, we sum up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying 5 by 4:
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying 20 by 2:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is \(\boxed{40}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we first find the elevation of the comb. Stanley was at 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, so the comb is at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The answer is 3,000 feet."
"To find out how much capital Mr. Josue has now, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount given by the second bank.
2. Add the amounts from both banks to his initial capital.

The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000. The second bank gave him twice as much, which is:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ dollars} \]

Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital, we get:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:
\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there are 50 cats on a rock. Four boats each carry away 5 cats, so the total number of cats carried away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we get:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats run after a mouse. The number of cats that run after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     28 - 6 = 22
     \]

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is:
     \[
     6 - 2 = 4
     \]

3. **Determine the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22.
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is $2.
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     22 + 2 = 24
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference in original prices:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     28 - 24 = 4

"Lillian has a total of 6 bird feeders in her garden. Out of these, 3 are homemade and each attracts 10 more birds than the 3 store-bought feeders, which attract 20 birds each.

First, calculate the number of birds attracted by each homemade feeder:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds per homemade feeder} \]

Next, calculate the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Then, calculate the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Finally, add the number of birds attracted by both types of feeders to find the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day:

"To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kenny has:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Determine the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 100 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 100 \times \frac{3}{2} = 150 \).

So, Kenny started with 150 cards.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \( 22 \times 1 = 22 \) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is \( 36 + 22 = 58 \) hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \( 58 - 54 = 4 \) hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6.

Then, we add 4 to this result to find the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Finally, we add the number of letters in both names to get the total:
\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To find the final cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.

1. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00.
2. The set of mixing bowls costs $20.00.
3. The 5 separate utensils cost $5.00 each, so 5 utensils cost \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

Adding these together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[ 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. To find 80% of $165, we calculate:
\[ 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \]

Therefore, the final cost of Charlotte's order is:
\[ \boxed{132} \]"
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy:
- Skipping rope: $6

- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Dora has:
- Saved from allowance: $2
- Given by her mother: $16

Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18

Now, we find the difference between the total cost and the total money Dora has:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas are equally divided into 5 containers, we calculate the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey needed. Josey required \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate the amount of gas Josey needed in gallons:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, we convert the amount of gas from gallons to pints. There are 8 pints in a gallon, so we convert \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons to pints:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the amount of gasoline Josey needed is:

\[ \boxed{6 \text{ pints}} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candy bars George bought after purchasing 3 bags of chips and spending a total of $5, with 1% of his money left.

1. Calculate the amount of money George had left:
   \[
   5 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.05 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. Determine the amount of money George spent:
   \[
   5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Calculate the cost of 3 bags of chips:
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find the amount spent on candy bars:
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. Determine the number of candy bars bought by dividing the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
   \[
   \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5

"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions needed.
2. Calculate the cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the cost of the beef stock.
4. Find the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

First, Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are on sale for $2.00 per box. Therefore, the total cost for the beef stock is:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives the total cost of the ingredients:
\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before him.

1. Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes.
2. Bernadette's travel time is four times Wayne's travel time, which is \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.
3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater, Bernadette needs to account for her 16-minute travel time and the additional 5 minutes to arrive early.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we calculate the difference between her travel time and Wayne's travel time, plus the 5-minute buffer:

\[ 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Let's calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Since each pack contains 20 pieces of beads, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \text{ pack} + 2 \text{ packs} = 3 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \text{ packs} + 4 \text{ packs} = 7 \text{ packs} \]
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ pieces per pack} = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
\[ 140 \text{ pieces} - 60 \text{ pieces} = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."

- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of the hay consumed by Michael's horse and then find out how much change Michael receives.

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance is:
     \[
     32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   - The horse eats \(\frac{1}{2}\) a bail of hay per mile.
   - For 16 miles, the horse eats:
     \[
     16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - For 8 bails, the total cost is:
     \[
     8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the change Michael receives:**
   - Michael has six $5 bills, which is:
     \[
     6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The change after buying the hay is:
     \[
     30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.**

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:
\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.**

Since there are 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.**

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day. Given that the total walking time required is 240 minutes, we divide this by the total number of days:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Therefore, Jason has to spend \(\boxed{20}\) minutes walking each day."
"To determine how many books each of Sarah's 4 kids received, we first need to find out the total number of books she bought. Given that each book costs $15 and she spent $300, we can calculate the total number of books as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
\]

Now that we know Sarah bought 20 books, we need to divide these books equally among her 4 kids:

\[
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Therefore, each child received 5 books. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

Given:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.
- There are 32 kids in total.

First, we calculate the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the substances (dairy or peanuts):
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to at least one of the substances. Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay, then sum these amounts.

1. **Plane Tickets:**
   - Each plane ticket costs $5000.
   - Since there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Stay:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - During the busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. Therefore, the increased price per day is:
     \[
     1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay gives:
     \[
     10000 + 5400 = 15400
     \]

Thus, the total cost of the trip is \(\boxed{15400}\)."

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we can set up equations for the total cost at each venue and then solve for the number of guests.

Let \( x \) be the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) for which the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total yards of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by calculating the amount each used individually.

"Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( x \) dollars.

Suzie bought:
- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and stick yield of the available wood types. 

- A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4 and provides 200 sticks.
- A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6 and provides 400 sticks.

Frederick has $24 to spend. First, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 4 piece provides 200 sticks, so 6 pieces will provide:
\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Next, we check if buying 2 x 8 pieces would yield more sticks. With $24, the maximum number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy is:
\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

Each 2 x 8 piece provides 400 sticks, so 4 pieces will provide:
\[ 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} \]

Comparing the two options, buying 2 x 8 pieces yields more sticks. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:
\[ \boxed{1600} \]"
"To determine the total cost for the snowshoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total cost for the snowshoes is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass.

Each bus trip costs $2.20, and she takes two trips each day. Therefore, the cost per day is:
\[ 2 \times 2.20 = 4.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she takes these trips five days a week, the total cost for the week is:
\[ 4.40 \times 5 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The weekly bus pass costs $20. The savings from buying the weekly bus pass would be the difference between the total cost of individual trips and the cost of the pass:
\[ 22 - 20 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.

First, let's determine the number of cows in the zoo:
- Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

Next, let's determine the number of sheep on the farm:
- Since the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep, the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

**Final Answer:**

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."
"Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each for $4 per pack. First, calculate the total number of canvas bags she bought:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ canvas bags} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the canvas bags:

"Given the problem, we need to determine how many cookies Kelsie made based on the information provided.

1. Suzanne made 36 cookies.
2. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]
3. Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies that Josh made:
   \[
   \text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"First, let's calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially. Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount is:
\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:
\[ 80 - 48 = 32 \]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying the dinner is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Given that Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, we first convert this time into minutes. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, Rob takes \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. Double Rob's time is \(2 \times 120 = 240\) minutes. Adding 40 minutes to this gives \(240 + 40 = 280\) minutes.

Therefore, the time Royce takes to shingle a house is \(\boxed{280}\) minutes."
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs, we first calculate the number of skeins required for one set of winter wear and then multiply by the number of grandchildren.

For one set of winter wear:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the strawberry-picking rate for each individual and then sum these rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour.

1. **Tony's Rate**: Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby's Rate**: Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby's rate is \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy's Rate**: Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy's rate is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky's Rate**: Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky's rate is \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:
\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

"To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to calculate her weekly consumption and cost in both scenarios.

First, let's calculate her current weekly consumption and cost:
- Daily consumption: \(12 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 288 \, \text{kWh}\)
- Weekly consumption: \(288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2016 \, \text{kWh}\)
- Weekly cost: \(2016 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3024 \, \text{\$}\)

Next, let's calculate her weekly consumption and cost after adding the new device:
- Additional daily consumption from the new device: \(2 \, \text{kWh} \times 24 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{kWh}\)
- New daily consumption: \(288 \, \text{kWh} + 48 \, \text{kWh} = 336 \, \text{kWh}\)
- New weekly consumption: \(336 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2352 \, \text{kWh}\)
- New weekly cost: \(2352 \, \text{kWh} \times 1.50 \, \text{\$/kWh} = 3528 \, \text{\$}\)

Finally, the difference between her weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is:

Therefore, the difference is \(\boxed{504}\)."
"To solve this problem, we start by determining the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house. This means the rate for one person is:
\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:
\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. Converting days into hours, we get:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   59 + 7 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve this problem, we start by determining Jame's current age. Since Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

Next, we calculate Jame's age in 8 years, which will be \(22 + 8 = 30\).

According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be \(2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55\).

To find Jame's cousin's current age, we subtract 8 years from 55, giving us \(55 - 8 = 47\).

The current age difference between Jame and his cousin is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of the two now is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Given:
- Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To determine how many vlogs Emma should make in the fourth week to meet her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we first calculate the total number of vlogs she has already made in the first three weeks.

For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

Adding these together:
\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

2. Calculate the total bill including the tip:
   - Total bill = Original bill + Tip = $50 + $10 = $60.

3. Split the total bill evenly:
   - Each person pays half of the total bill.
   - Amount each person pays = $60 / 2 = $30.

Therefore, you end up paying $30."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we start by breaking down the month into two halves and setting up the necessary equations.

1. **Determine the number of days in each half of April:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April has 15 days.
   - The second half of April has 15 days.

2. **Define the daily savings for the first half:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April.

3. **Define the daily savings for the second half:**
   - According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much each day in the second half as he does in the first half.
   - Therefore, he saves \( 2x \) each day in the second half of April.

4. **Calculate the total savings for the first half:**
   - Total savings in the first half = \( 15x \).

5. **Calculate the total savings for the second half:**
   - Total savings in the second half = \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \).

6. **Set up the equation for the total monthly savings:**
   - Total monthly savings = Savings in the first half + Savings in the second half.
   - \( 15x + 30x = 45x \).

7. **Equate the total monthly savings to the target:**
   - \( 45x = 1125 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

9. **Determine the daily savings for the second half:**
   - Daily savings in the second half = \( 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).

Therefore, Elvis has to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of the month."

"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we start by calculating the total number of toys needed for his sorted play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys and Jonathan's play set needs to be five times larger, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this total. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Thus, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"To find out how much Daniel has to spend, we first calculate the total cost of the items before any discount is applied.

- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply a 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{27.00}\) on all the items he wants to buy."

"To calculate Antonella's earnings, we need to break down her sales into two parts: the first $1000 and the amount over $1000.

1. For the first $1000 in sales, she earns a 30% commission:
   \[
   1000 \times 0.30 = 300
   \]

2. For the sales over $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500, she earns an additional 10% commission:
   \[
   1500 \times 0.10 = 150
   \]

3. Adding these two amounts together gives her total earnings:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"Bill starts with 2 cases of water, with each case containing 24 bottles. Therefore, the total number of bottles he initially has is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is \(\boxed{180}\) pounds."
"The problem involves determining the angle of the sun from the ground after it has moved for a certain period of time. Initially, the sun is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward. Over a period of 10 hours, the sun will move an additional 50 degrees.

To find the final angle of the sun from the ground, we add the initial angle to the total movement:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is \(\boxed{82}\) degrees."
"James has two sons. One is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, making him 8 years old. Therefore, James needs 12 candles for the first son and 8 candles for the second son, totaling 20 candles.

Each pack of candles contains 5 candles and costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles per pack: \(20 \div 5 = 4\). So, James needs to buy 4 packs of candles.

The cost for 4 packs is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the pages read in each week and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the reading time in the first week:
- Judy reads 15 minutes each night.
- There are 7 nights in a week.
So, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to determine how many pages she reads in the first week. Given that she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can find out how many pages she reads per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

Let's express the nephew's age in 7 years as \( N + 7 \).

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be three times his nephew's age:
\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to find the percentage by which her oven is off. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( T \). The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

So, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."
"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the durations of both movies:

Next, calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, calculate the earnings for both:
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, find the difference in earnings:
Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill.

The final answer is:
\boxed{40}"
"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories she burns from both activities.

1. Calculate the calories burned from aerobics:
   \[
   2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}
   \]

2. Calculate the calories burned from running:
   \[
   1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

3. Add the calories burned from both activities to get the total:
   \[
   1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

4. Determine the amount of water needed based on the total calories burned. Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned:
   \[
   \frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}
   \]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water."
"Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
Subtract \( 2J \) from both sides:
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the dental work.

1. The base price for 2 implants is \(2 \times \$2000 = \$4000\).
2. The additional cost for the porcelain crown is \$500.
3. Therefore, the total cost is \( \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500 \).

George has already put down a deposit of \$600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is \( \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900 \).

George makes \$15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn \$3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:

\[ \frac{\$3900}{\$15 \text{ per hour}} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

"Let's denote the smallest angle in the triangle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \(3x\).

The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

Now, we know the smallest angle is \(30\) degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. The largest angle is \(90\) degrees.

Thus, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to convert all his coins into nickels.

- Colby has 8 quarters. Since 1 quarter is equivalent to 5 nickels, 8 quarters are equivalent to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) nickels.
- Colby has 6 dimes. Since 1 dime is equivalent to 2 nickels, 6 dimes are equivalent to \(6 \times 2 = 12\) nickels.
- Colby has 14 nickels, which is already in nickels, so 14 nickels remain as 14 nickels.
- Colby has 15 pennies. Since 1 nickel is equivalent to 5 pennies, 15 pennies are equivalent to \(15 \div 5 = 3\) nickels.

Now, we add up all the nickels:
\[40 + 12 + 14 + 3 = 69\] nickels.

Since each gumball costs 1 nickel, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.

**Final Answer:**

"To find the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of washings per bottle:**
   - The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.

2. **Calculate the number of washings per pump:**
   - Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
     \[
     \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per washing:**
   - The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per pump:**
   - Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents:**

"To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of meat in the bull, which is 750 kg.
2. Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day. Since he sells 15 kg of meat every hour and works 10 hours a day, the amount of meat he sells in one day is:
   \[
   15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]
3. Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat by dividing the total amount of meat by the amount he sells per day:
   \[
   \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Prince \(\boxed{5}\) days to sell the meat from Bill's bull."
"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of seats in the auditorium. Given that there are 4 rows with 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is:
\[ 4 \times 18 = 72 \]

Next, we determine the number of seats occupied by the administrators. Since one-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, we have:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \]

Subtracting the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats gives us the remaining seats:
\[ 72 - 18 = 54 \]

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. Therefore, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \]

The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Subtracting the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats gives us the number of seats occupied by the students:
\[ 54 - 18 = 36 \]

Thus, the number of students in the school auditorium is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find the total number of functioning street lights, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.**
Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection.
\[ 4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of street lights at all intersections.**

"To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
2. Multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour.

First, let's find the total number of hours:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week, he went twice, and each session lasted 2 hours.
- Therefore, each week he spent \(2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 4 \text{ hours/week}\).
- Over 6 weeks, he spent \(6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}\).

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- The cost per hour is $125.
- Therefore, the total cost is \(24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour} = 3000 \text{ dollars}\).

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed. Therefore, we calculate:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

Thus, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
2. Convert the speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.

**Step 1: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert 20 kb/s to Mb/s by dividing by 1000:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb/s} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

**Step 2: Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/h:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(\boxed{72}\) Mb per hour."
"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck in a week, we can break it down as follows:

1. **First Three Days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Total cars for the first three days: \(10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}\).

2. **Remaining Four Days:**
   - The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day for the remaining four days.
   - Therefore, the number of cars towed each of these days is \(10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day}\).
   - Total cars for the remaining four days: \(6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}\).

3. **Total for the Week:**
   - Adding the cars towed in the first three days and the remaining four days: \(30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}\).

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[
\text{Cost per car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[
\text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
\]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

\[ 100 \times 0.25 = 25 \]

Out of these 25 surfers, 60% are women, which means 40% are men. Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given:
- The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
- The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
\]

The total price for all three jewels is:
\[
\boxed{4800}

   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

This means Tom is closing the gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, the time it takes for Tom to catch up is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

5 hours"

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by calculating the cost per class if he misses a certain number of classes.

Given:
- Total cost for Karate classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, reversing the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as her less-experienced colleague Jewel. Daily, Jewel processes 50 customers. To find the total weekly production for the two, we first determine how many customers Julie processes daily. Since Julie is twice as fast, she processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:
\[
\boxed{1050}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total cost Clara paid for her pomegranates on Tuesday:
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
- Initial cost: \(20 \times 20 = 400\) dollars.
- She got a $2 discount.
- Final cost: \(400 - 2 = 398\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost Sheila paid for her pomegranates on Wednesday:
- The price per pomegranate on Wednesday is $30.
- Initial cost for 20 pomegranates: \(20 \times 30 = 600\) dollars.
- The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost.
- Discount amount: \(600 \times 0.10 = 60\) dollars.
- Final cost: \(600 - 60 = 540\) dollars.

Now, find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
- Difference: \(540 - 398 = 142\) dollars.

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \(\boxed{142}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings in the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the earnings in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the two months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2100}

"James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. He gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, so each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost for the first hour: $15
- Cost for the next two hours: $30 * 2 = $60

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 15 + 60 = 75 \]

So, James paid \(\boxed{75}\)."

"Given the problem, we need to determine the total cooking time for rice, pork, and beans.

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - It is given that it took 30 minutes to cook the rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - It took 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for pork is \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - The beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - The combined cooking time of pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the cooking time for beans is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

4. **Total Cooking Time:**
   - To find the total cooking time, we add the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans.
   - Total cooking time = \(30 + 50 + 40 = 120\) minutes.

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) be the number of geese.

We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.

From the problem, we have two equations based on the total number of heads and legs:
1. The total number of heads is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Roger buys a week's worth of coffee at a more expensive brand that costs 20% more than the normal brand, which originally costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand thus costs:
\[ 5 + (5 \times 0.20) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound} \]

Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for 7 days, he buys:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds of coffee} \]

The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine how much money each person would have if Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia decided to share their total money equally.

First, let's find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine how much money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add together the money that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

\[
\text{Total money} = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they decide to share the money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

2. Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
4. Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

From the problem, we know:
- Katarina has 68 cookies, so \( K = 68 \).
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so \( K = M - 5 \). Substituting \( K = 68 \), we get \( 68 = M - 5 \). Solving for \( M \), we find \( M = 73 \).
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so \( M = C + 12 \). Substituting \( M = 73 \), we get \( 73 = C + 12 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 61 \).
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so \( S = M + 23 \). Substituting \( M = 73 \), we get \( S = 73 + 23 \). Solving for \( S \), we find \( S = 96 \).

Now, we sum the number of cookies each person has:

"Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn by using ""turtle"" mode for half and ""rabbit"" mode for the other half, we first need to find the mowing rates for both modes.

- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

"Let's define the variables for the ages of the individuals:
- Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- Let \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as equations:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, find the age of one of the twins:
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies given the cost of individual items.

First, we find the cost of one candy. We know that 4 candies cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
Thus, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month, which means Neil saves \(20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28\) coins every month.

Over ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months. Therefore, the total number of coins Rong saves is \(20 \times 120 = 2400\), and the total number of coins Neil saves is \(28 \times 120 = 3360\).

Adding these together, the total number of coins they have saved together is \(2400 + 3360 = 5760\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{5760}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of the vet visit and then find out how much money John has left after paying for the services.

1. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - The dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

2. Let the total bill be \(x\) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is \(0.6x\) dollars.

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[
   x = 40 + 0.6x
   \]

4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4x = 40
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
   \]

5. John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then sum them up.

1. **Red squares**: There are 14 red squares.
2. **Blue squares**: There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so:
   \[
   14 + 4 = 18
   \]
3. **Green squares**: There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so:
   \[
   18 + 6 = 24
   \]
4. **White squares**: There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Now, we sum the number of all the squares:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the comforter is 68 square feet.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get for the function.

First, we know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Next, we find the total number of chairs currently available at the restaurant:
\[ \text{Total current chairs} = \text{Number of regular chairs} + \text{Number of high chairs} = 40 + 8 = 48 \]

For the function, there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending, so the total number of chairs needed is:
\[ \text{Total chairs needed} = 42 + 15 = 57 \]

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of chairs needed:
\[ \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total chairs needed} - \text{Total current chairs} = 57 - 48 = 9 \]

"To find the combined total number of times Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of taps for each foot separately and then sum them up.

First, let's determine the time spent with her arms down and raised:
- Arms down: \(5 \text{ minutes} - 2 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ minutes}\)
- Arms raised: \(2 \text{ minutes}\)

Next, we calculate the number of taps for each foot:
- Right foot:
  - Arms down: \(300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}\)
  - Arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
  - Total: \(900 + 400 = 1300 \text{ taps}\)

- Left foot:
  - Arms down: \(250 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ taps}\)
  - Arms raised: \(200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}\)
  - Total: \(750 + 400 = 1150 \text{ taps}\)

"First, let's calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

Next, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his two friends. Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
So, the three friends together ate:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to determine how many slices were eaten by the other two friends. Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
So, the two friends together ate:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

"To find the average time it takes for a cat and a dog to eat nine sausages, we start by determining the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages. Given that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that time:

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time by finding the mean of the two times:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, we start by converting the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Converting this to inches:

\[ 8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches} \]

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The equation based on the given information is:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:

"At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station. By midday (12:00), \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the people had voted. This means:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \text{ people had voted by midday.}
\]

The remaining people after midday are:

\[
5000 - 2000 = 3000 \text{ people.}
\]

By 16:00, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining people had voted. This means:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \text{ people had voted by 16:00.}
\]

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is:

\[
3000 - 2000 = 1000 \text{ people.}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of ice cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water Peter has.

1. **Giant cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water. Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   \[
   3 \text{ giant cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Medium cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water. Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   \[
   7 \text{ medium cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces per cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}

   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total for one 4-week month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total for two 4-week months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is \(\boxed{4000}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gunther initially had 48 bananas.
2. Arnold stole half of the bananas:
   \[
   \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, Gunther was left with:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
   \]
3. The next day, Gunther added 25 more bananas:
   \[
   24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
   \]
4. Arnold then stole 12 bananas:
   \[
   49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
   \]
5. On the third day, Gunther added another 6 bananas:
   \[
   37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
   \]

So, the final number of bananas in the pile is:

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the monthly share for each roommate.
2. Determine the annual share for each roommate.

**Step 1: Calculate the monthly share for each roommate.**

The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 5 people sharing the bill equally. Therefore, the monthly share for each person is:
\[ \text{Monthly share} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the annual share for each roommate.**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual share for each person is:
\[ \text{Annual share} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each roommate will pay \(\boxed{240}\) dollars per year for electricity."

86 glasses and 42 plates"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

6. **Total Number of Buttons:**

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of people on the council is 33, which means the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against is 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, let's break down the problem step by step:

"To determine how many people think horse #12 will win, we start by calculating the number of people who think horse #2 will win:

20% of 50 people = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

Next, we find the number of remaining people after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win:

50 people - 10 people = 40 people

Then, we calculate how many of these remaining people think horse #7 will win:

60% of 40 people = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

Finally, we determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total number of people:

50 people - 10 people - 24 people = 16 people

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish he bought is 17, so \(O + W = 17\).
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is \(3 + O\) and the number of white fish is \(4 + W\). According to the problem, \(3 + O = 2(4 + W)\).

We can simplify the second equation:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(O + W = 17\)
2. \(O - 2W = 5\)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \(W\):
\[2O + 2W = 34\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now, add these two equations:
\[2O + 2W + O - 2W = 34 + 5\]
\[3O = 39\]
\[O = 13\]

Now substitute \(O = 13\) back into the first equation:
\[13 + W = 17\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. The correct answer is:
\[\boxed{4}\]"

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of all her stuffed animals, we start by calculating the current total number of stuffed animals she has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is \(\boxed{17}\) dollars."
"Let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"John buys 3 goats at $500 each and 2 cows at $1500 each. To find the total amount spent, we calculate the cost for the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

The cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent is:
\[
\boxed{4500}

"Joe initially has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars} \]

Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is:

\[ 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars} \]

After selling 8 cars, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. So, the number of cars he gives away is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

The number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving some away is:

\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \text{ cars} \]

Therefore, the final number of cars Joe remains with is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how much each student raised, we start by finding the total amount of money raised by the students. The charity raised a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount equally among the 20 students. So, the amount raised by each student is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised \(\boxed{6250}\)."

"In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which means Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points. However, we need to focus on Sasha's performance in the second game. The problem states that in the second game, which was played at Julie's home court, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. Since Julie scored 10 points in the first game, Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.

To find the total points Sasha scored during both games, we add the points from both games together:
\[14 + 4 = 18\]

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:
\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:
\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

And Becca has:
\[3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\]

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

For the second part:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is \(\boxed{80}\) miles."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross a highway, given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to do so.

First, let's find the total distance \(D\) the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos, each traveling at speed \(v\), take 18 hours to cross the highway, the distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:

"To determine how many students are good at math, we need to consider the given categories of students and use basic set theory.

1. There are 20 students in total.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students perform well in English only.
4. The rest are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. We know the total number of students and the number of students who are good at only one subject:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
2. Divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs of shoes to find the average cost per pair.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

James spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"Let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"Let \( x \) represent the usual length of Elaina's concerts in minutes. According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. This can be expressed with the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."
"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives away 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. The total number of toys given away is \(40 + 80 + 30 = 150\). Therefore, the number of toys Argo has now is \(200 - 150 = 50\).

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"Given that the singer has 50 microphones and 20% of them won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs, we first calculate the number of microphones that won't fit:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means 10 microphones won't fit, leaving us with:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since the microphones are arranged in pairs, the number of pairs is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we first calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the orchids is \(5 \times 5 = 25\).

For the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
- Therefore, the total number of petals on the daisies is \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

Next, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
- The total number of petals on the daisies is 40.
- The total number of petals on the orchids is 25.
- The difference is \(40 - 25 = 15\).

Thus, the daisies have 15 more petals compared to the orchids.

The final answer is:
15"
"To determine the percentage of flowering plants in Mrs. Smith's garden, we start by calculating the number of indoor plants. Since one-fourth of the 100 plants are indoor plants, we have:

\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

Next, we find the number of remaining plants after accounting for the indoor plants:

\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. Therefore, the number of outdoor plants is:

\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

The rest of the plants are flowering plants. Thus, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 100 - 25 - 50 = 25 \]

To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the plants that are flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can determine the speed of the thingamabob first. Let the speed of the thingamabob be \( v \) meters per second. Therefore, the speed of the whatchamacallit is \( 11v \). We know that:

\[ 11v = 121 \]

Solving for \( v \):

\[ v = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ meters per second} \]

Now, since a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ 5v = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ meters per second} \]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is \(\boxed{55}\) meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot, let's break down the total cost Ellen incurs each day.

1. The cost of the salad is $6.
2. The cost of the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which is $6 / 2 = $3.
3. The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.
4. Ellen pays $11 in total for her goods, so the cost of the carrots is $11 - $9 = $2.
5. Since Ellen eats 2 carrots a day, the cost of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

Therefore, the cost of one carrot is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, which totals to \(8 \times 5 = 40\) hours per week. His new hourly wage, after a raise of $2 from his previous $10 per hour, is \(10 + 2 = 12\) dollars per hour. Therefore, his weekly earnings are \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, define the variables:
- Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
- Let \( K \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
- Let \( A \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( K = 3J \) (Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's).
2. \( A = 5J \) (Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's).

Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time he mowed his lawn. Therefore, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6K + 6A \]

Substituting \( K \) and \( A \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let \( L \) be the amount she made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ L + 54J = 80 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

To find a feasible value for \( J \), we need \( L \) to be a non-negative amount. The simplest and most logical assumption is that \( J \) is an integer. Let's test the smallest possible value for \( J \):

If \( J = 1 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 1 = 80 - 54 = 26 \]

If \( J = 2 \):
\[ L = 80 - 54 \times 2 = 80 - 108 = -28 \] (which is not possible since \( L \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), and the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is \(55 + 16 = 71\) kg. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is \(71 + 8 = 79\) kg. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is \(79 - 5 = 74\) kg.

Therefore, the weight of Harry is \(\boxed{74}\) kg."

"To determine the total amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Material for Small Masks:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 small mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - For 20 small masks, the material required is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Material for Large Masks:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for 1 large mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]
   - For 8 large masks, the material required is:
     \[
     8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Total Material:**

"Given that Duncan's current age is 60, we need to determine Adam's age in 8 years based on the information that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

First, let's express the given information in an equation. If \( D \) is Duncan's current age and \( A \) is Adam's current age, then:
- Duncan's age eight years ago is \( D - 8 \).
- Adam's age four years ago is \( A - 4 \).

According to the problem, we have:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Adding 4 to both sides to solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total number of lollipops sold = \(30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}\).

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5.
   - Total cost = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:**
   - Profit = \(240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

2. She will have been collecting shells for \(10 - 5 = 5\) years by her 10th birthday.
3. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months she has been collecting shells is \(5 \times 12 = 60\).

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected \(\boxed{60}\) shells."
"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total and divides them into 3 rows. This means each row contains:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]

cups. In each row, the chamomile and mint tea cups are equal in number. Therefore, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

So, the number of mint tea cups in each row is:

\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down the tree and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool has 10,000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of water that will be emptied from the tank over 6 days. Given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, the total amount of water emptied in 6 days is:

\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Subtracting the total amount of water emptied from the initial amount in the tank gives:

\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget and then figure out how many tickets he can afford with that budget.

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To find the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories for both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately and then sum them up.

1. **Mini Cinnamon Rolls:**
   - A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   - A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

2. **Mini Blueberry Muffins:**
   - A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   - A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
   - Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

3. **Total Calories:**
   - The total calories from all the pastries are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Next, we find the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."
"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we need to sum the quantities of the other toys and subtract this sum from the total number of toys.

The quantities of the other toys are:
- Building blocks: 31
- Stuffed animals: 8
- Stacking rings: 9

First, we add these quantities together:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find the number of bouncy balls, we subtract the sum of the other toys from the total number of toys:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as \( P \), \( Pa \), and \( J \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

First, substitute \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Next, substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, the total number of balloons given to her friends is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons.
2. Maria also had 1 water balloon for herself.
3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (including Maria) 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people in total (4 friends + Maria), the total number of additional balloons given is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Now, let's calculate the total number of balloons:
- Balloons given to friends: 8
- Balloons Maria had: 1
- Additional balloons given by mom: 15

Adding these together, we get:
\[8 + 1 + 15 = 24\]

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"To determine how many new tables the charity group needs, we start by calculating the total number of boxes available. 

10 people donate 5 boxes each, so the total number of donated boxes is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

Adding the 10 boxes they already have:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can fit 2 boxes of stuff. To find out how many tables are needed in total, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

The charity group already owns 15 tables. To find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

Therefore, the number of new tables they need is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines:**

   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
   - Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make \(\boxed{64800}\) more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both options and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The cost for the first 12 hours is 1000 pesos.
- Cameron stays for an additional 5 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning is 17 hours total, so 17 - 12 = 5 hours).
- The cost for each additional hour is 70 pesos, so for 5 additional hours, the cost is \(5 \times 70 = 350\) pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay is \(1000 + 350 = 1350\) pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the 24-hour stay option:
- The cost for a 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first calculate the hay required for the goats and then for the sheep.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Since each goat needs 5 pounds, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

"James buys 10 CDs at $15 each, but he gets them for 40% off. The total cost before the discount is:

\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

With a 40% discount, the cost is reduced by 40% of $150:

\[ 0.40 \times 150 = 60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs for $40 each:

\[ 5 \times 40 = 200 \]

Since he only spent $90 and sold the CDs for $200, the net amount he was out is:

"Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he staples is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince staples is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - From 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total time awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 24 measuring cups since he has two dozen cups. He has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons}
\]

After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has:

\[
16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons remaining}
\]

Adding the remaining measuring spoons to the measuring cups, the total number of utensils Jonathan has is:

\[
24 + 10 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, with initially 1/5 of the beds occupied. This means:
\[ \text{Initially occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]
Thus, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions is:
\[ 50 \times 14 = 700 \]

Adding these new admissions to the initially occupied beds gives the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:
\[ 200 + 700 = 900 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
\[ 1000 - 900 = 100 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. The remaining emails are:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Two-thirds of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means the remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are sent to her boyfriend:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"Given that Aliya is 3 years old and Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we calculate his age as:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

\[
\boxed{45}

"Given that Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert and Kelly stated that this number was 20% higher than the actual number, we can set up the equation to find the actual number of attendees.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \).

According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now, substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
2. Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.
3. Use the information that the number of holes by the end of the fourth day is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

First, let's calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Next, we know that at the end of the first day, they had 10 holes. By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of corn chips each person received:**
   - Amora received 70 corn chips.
   - Lainey received 70 corn chips.
   - Collins received 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, which is \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.

2. **Calculate the total number of corn chips:**
   - Add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
     \[
     70 + 70 + 85 = 225
     \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To find the total cost of travel, we start by identifying the cost of supplies and the additional cost for the tickets.

The cost of supplies is $400. The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. Therefore, we calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of supplies gives us the total cost of the tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Each episode of the show is 20 minutes long. We are told that the total number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

Thus, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}
\]"
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction.

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies. When she got home, her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

First, we calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 - 18 = 48 \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is \(8 \times 2 = 16\) years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. Therefore, his sister is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old.

The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of string and then sum these times.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:

   \]

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \[
   5 \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set (half synthetic gut, half polyester string):
   \[
   4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Adding these times together:
\[
45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes."

The first two phones are at full price:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away. This leaves her with \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes. She then kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) boxes. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is \(6 \times 20 = 120\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \).

According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, the number of states in India can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is \( x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the books:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work is:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books."
"Given that Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries, and Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard, we can determine the number of cherries each person has as follows:

1. Since Robert has 30 cherries and this is 10 more than Richard, Richard has:
   \[
   30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries}
   \]

2. The total number of cherries is 60. Subtracting the cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total gives the number of cherries Jerry has:
   \[
   60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries}

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, he will be 5 years from now. At that time:
- Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

To find their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his dad's current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his brother's current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

"To determine how many students are leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we have:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

Next, we find out how many students remain after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the number of cheerleaders and band members is:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of petunias needed.
2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

First, let's find the total number of petunias needed:
- Each basket needs 3 petunias.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

Next, let's find the total number of sweet potato vines needed:
- Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines.
- Katherine has 5 baskets.
- Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

Now, let's calculate the cost of the petunias:
- Each petunia costs $3.00.
- Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
- Total cost for sweet potato vines = \(10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00\).

Finally, let's add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
- Total cost = \$45.00 + \$25.00 = \$70.00.

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is:
\[

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil. Since they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. Since they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for sunflowers and carnations gives:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with a 30-pound bag of soil. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \div 1 = 3 \]

Thus, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for shoes. 

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes. To find out how much she can spend on shoes in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by 12 (the number of months in a year):

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000.00, we divide her annual savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.

6"
"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes separately and then combine the times.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since these tasks need to be done sequentially, we add the times together:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

**Final Answer:**
45 minutes"
"Let's break down the temperature changes step by step:

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

"To determine how old Bill was when he saw Comet Halley for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet. According to the problem, Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet.
2. Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time. The problem states that Bill was three times his dad's age when his dad saw the comet. Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
3. Calculate the time interval between the two sightings. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.
4. Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time. If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the frequency of each type of check and then sum them up.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: Buford writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:
   \[
   1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ checks}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[
12 \text{ (electric)} + 12 \text{ (gas)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:

"Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day as \( F \).

According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).

The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write:
\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

So, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"

1. Identify the total cost of the trousers, which is $30.
2. Determine the amount given by Adam's mother, which is $6.
3. Calculate the amount given by Adam's father, which is twice the amount given by his mother, so \(2 \times 6 = 12\) dollars.
4. Add the amounts given by his parents: \(6 + 12 = 18\) dollars.
5. Subtract the total amount given by his parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute: \(30 - 18 = 12\) dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Given the information:
- Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
- Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
- Total age of the children is 20, so \(A + B + H + W = 20\)
- Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group, so \(H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4}\)

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[3 + 4 + H + W = 20\]
\[7 + H + W = 20\]
\[H + W = 13\]

Next, use the equation for Helene's age:
\[H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4}\] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4}\]
\[H = 2 \times 5\]
\[H = 10\]

Now, find Wilfred's age \(W\) using \(H + W = 13\):
\[10 + W = 13\]
\[W = 3\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of cookies brought to the reception. With 100 guests and each bringing 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

If each person in the church next door received 15 cookies, the number of people in the church can be found by dividing the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is equivalent to \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

Therefore, each adult gets \(\boxed{25\%}\) of the watermelon."
"Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic on Monday. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds and has 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes.

First, calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the total time spent on appointments:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Add the time spent on rounds and appointments:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert the total time spent on rounds and appointments to hours:
\[ 480 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Subtract the time spent on rounds and appointments from the total time at the clinic:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining variables for the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter and Martha. Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes, and \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes.

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can write the equation:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

Next, we solve these equations for \( p \) and \( m \):
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Calculate \( 1400 \times 5.9 \):
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

Calculate \( 8260 \times 0.10 \):
\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for a down payment on a $10,000 car, we first calculate her total earnings per hour from both wages and tips:

\[ \text{Total hourly earnings} = \$10 + \$15 = \$25 \]

Next, we calculate the amount she needs to save for the down payment, which is 20% of $10,000:

\[ \text{Down payment} = 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

Janet works 40 hours a week, so her weekly earnings are:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

"First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased.

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."
"Anne purchased a box of sweets containing 15 packs, with each pack having 60 pieces. She kept 2 packs for herself and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally.

"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

\[ \boxed{139} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining how many pictures are in each album. Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and distributed them evenly into 8 albums. Therefore, the number of pictures per album is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 24:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so the number of guests decreases by 15:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the final number of guests in the hotel is:
\[

"In a 60-item quiz, 40% of the questions are easy, and the rest are equally divided as average and difficult questions. We need to determine how many points Aries is sure to get if she answers 75% of the easy questions correctly and half of the average and difficult questions correctly.

First, calculate the number of easy questions:
\[ 40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Next, calculate the number of remaining questions:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Since the remaining questions are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ (average questions)} \]
\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ (difficult questions)} \]

Now, calculate the number of easy questions Aries is sure to get correct:

"Let's denote the price of a small stuffed animal as \(S\) and the price of a large stuffed animal as \(L\). According to the problem, \(L = 3S\). Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \(S = 4\). Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is \(L = 3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.

Let \(x\) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x\).

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12) \]
\[ 120 = 8x + 12x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Since \(x\) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \(2x = 2 \times 6 = 12\).

Therefore, Teresa sold \(\boxed{12}\) small stuffed animals."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ore mining capacity of one dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up for 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the ore mining capacity with a steel pickaxe:**
   - One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the capacity doubles: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the capacity is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - Each dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total ore mined is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

The final answer is:

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\(\boxed{89.8\%}\)"

"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit, which we will do in inches.

Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert Xavier's height to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
Xavier then grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"
"Given that there are 50 books in a library, with half of them written in English and 10% in German, we can calculate the number of books written in each language as follows:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days."
"Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 120 people on the train.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (which is 100) board the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
4. At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train. So, the number of people on the train becomes:
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required and then find the total cost based on the price per tile.

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year after the accident, we first need to calculate the new monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month, and the insurance cost increased by 60% due to the accident.

First, calculate the increase in cost:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Next, add this increase to the normal cost to find the new monthly cost:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Now, to find the annual cost, multiply the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses and then figure out how many loads are required based on the machine's capacity.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = 6 \(\times\) 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"Given that Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas, and each pizza had 8 slices, the total number of slices available is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

We know that:
- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

Adding up the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
\[10 + 7 + 14 = 31\]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[2D = 80\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**

"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the daily consumption of the first two monkeys and then find the remaining amount for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Over a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   Over a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. The total number of bananas bought is 315. Therefore, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. Since the third monkey eats the same number of bananas each day, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is:

"First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, the cost of one rose is:

\[ \text{Cost of one rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved, we calculate:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."

"To determine the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create \(14400\) jellyfish.

4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{72000}

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost for both methods and then find the difference.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from 10 bunches:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, calculate the total cost if Jenny bought these bananas individually:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, calculate the total cost for buying the bananas in bunches:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"The farmer produces 5 bales of hay per hour, while the truck picks up 3 bales per hour. Therefore, the net increase in the number of hay bales in the field each hour is \(5 - 3 = 2\) bales.

Over a 6-hour day, the total number of bales added to the field is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) bales.

Assuming the field starts with 0 bales, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"John has 8 classes each day, with each class lasting 40 minutes. He attends these classes for 5 days a week, so the total time spent in classes during the weekdays is:

\[ 8 \text{ classes/day} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

On the weekends, he spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each day. Therefore, the time spent on each day of the weekend is:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 100 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is:

\[ 100 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time gives the total weekly learning time:

\[ 1600 \text{ minutes} + 200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 30 hours a week learning.

"Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, so \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were eaten, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.

The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so the total area for these two walls is:
\[2 \times (10 \times 8) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet}\]

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so the total area for these two walls is:
\[2 \times (5 \times 8) = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ square feet}\]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[12 \times 12 = 144 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[
\boxed{144}

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the total capacity of the vehicles that could have transported people to the event. However, the problem does not provide the number of people in each car or bus that actually attended the ceremony. Therefore, we can only calculate the maximum possible number of people that could have been transported.

Given:
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- Each car carried 3 people.
- There were 12 buses.
- There were 20 cars.

First, calculate the total number of people that the buses could carry:

\[ 32 - 24 = 8 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Raymond has left is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Anna started with a budget of $16 and had already spent $4. She has $2 left after buying 2 books today. To find out how much she spent on the books, we subtract the remaining budget from the initial budget and then subtract the amount already spent:

\[ 16 - 2 = 14 \]
\[ 14 - 4 = 10 \]

Anna spent $10 on the 2 books. Since both books cost the same amount, we divide the total spent on books by 2:

\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, each book cost Anna $5.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we start with the number of students last year, which is 50. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

\[ 50 \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

Next, add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for the light to blink 459 times, we first need to find the rate at which the light blinks. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the rate as follows:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute} \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for the light to blink 459 times. Using the rate we just calculated, we can find the time by dividing the total number of blinks by the rate:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of male and female guppies and goldfishes after Tate buys additional fish.

Initially:
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

After buying more fish:
- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppies: 1
- Additional male goldfishes: 2
- Additional female goldfishes: 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of each type of fish:
- Total male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Total female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Total male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Total female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Next, we find the total number of male and female fishes:
- Total male fishes: \(6 \text{ (male guppies)} + 5 \text{ (male goldfishes)} = 11\)
- Total female fishes: \(8 \text{ (female guppies)} + 8 \text{ (female goldfishes)} = 16\)

Finally, we calculate the difference between the number of female and male fishes:
- Difference: \(16 - 11 = 5\)

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior spent on their chores, we need to calculate the time each person spent and then sum these times.

1. Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.
2. Megan spent 2 hours longer than Amalia walking the dog, so Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior spent more than 4 hours longer than Amalia doing laundry, so Dior spent at least \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" means at least 5 hours, but we can use 9 as a clear example of ""well over"").

Now, we add up the time spent by each person:
\[4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19\]

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 × One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 × 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits × Round trip distance
   - Total distance = 2 × 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Over 7 days, she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

According to the problem, in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, the distance Brian will walk in 7 days is:
\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers in 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed to complete the order:**
   - The order requires 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, 20 toys are still needed. This means the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the hourly production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Given that Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds, we can determine the weights of Elijah’s dogs as follows:

1. Elijah’s first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Elijah’s second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total weight of all three dogs, we sum their weights:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's work through the problem step by step:

1. **Kris's Stickers:**
   - Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob.
   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Luis's Stickers:**
   - Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris.
   - Since Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half.
   - Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Seth's Stickers:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Since Luis originally had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Thus, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

\[

"John starts with 3 large bags of M&M, each weighing 10 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of M&M is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 30 M&M per ounce, the total number of M&M he has is:
\[ 30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&M} \]

If he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the number of small bags he can make is:
\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we start by calculating half of the earth's circumference. The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, so half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies per day:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."
"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we need to follow these steps:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
2. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
4. Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we know:
- Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

We can substitute \( C \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

We also know the total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Now, we need to find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Nik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8, placing each group into a box. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, given that there are 16 ounces in a pound.

First, calculate the number of groups of crayons:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons is placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, calculate the total weight of the boxes:
\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

1. **Time spent on the beach:**
   - Given: 40 minutes.

2. **Distance on the beach:**
   - Given: 2 miles.

3. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \), we find the speed on the beach:
     \[
     v_{\text{beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Given that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach:
     \[
     v_{\text{sidewalk}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Distance on the sidewalk:**
   - Given: 1 mile.

6. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \), we find the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     t_{\text{sidewalk}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Total time for the entire walk:**
   - Total time = Time on the beach + Time on the sidewalk:
     \[
     t_{\text{total}} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for the past 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Her goal is to save a total of $60. Therefore, the amount she still needs to save is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Jane \(\boxed{7}\) more weeks to save a total of $60."

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle. The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to be able to drink it:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"To determine the number of potatoes Gomer ate, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of scoops Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.
   - This can be calculated as: \( 23 - 5 = 18 \) scoops.

2. **Determine the relationship between scoops and potatoes:**
   - It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.
   - This simplifies to: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) potatoes for \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) scoops.
   - Therefore, the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is: \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes per scoop.

3. **Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   - If 1 scoop requires \( \frac{3}{2} \) potatoes, then 18 scoops will require: \( 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18 \times 1.5 = 27 \) potatoes.

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester needs for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:

"To find the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we start by determining the probability of winning for each ticket.

1. The probability of winning for the first ticket, \( P_1 \), is given as 20%, or 0.20.
2. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so the probability of winning for the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
2. Determine the total number of apartments across all three complexes.
3. Calculate the total number of collections per week.
4. Compute the total earnings based on the payment per collection.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.**

The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. Therefore, the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes is:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

The third complex is 60% bigger than the combined number of apartments in the first two complexes. So, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
\[ 400 + 0.60 \times 400 = 400 + 240 = 640 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of apartments across all three complexes.**

Adding the number of apartments in all three complexes gives:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of collections per week.**

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each apartment. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \]

**Step 4: Compute the total earnings based on the payment per collection.**

He gets paid $0.40 per collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the production for each year based on the given information.

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let \(x\) be the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits. Since a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, \(x = 20 \times 50 = 1000\). So, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

Therefore, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1650}\)."

"Let's define the lengths of the ropes with variables:
- Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes was 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28, \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Substitute these expressions into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the initial amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Set up the equation for Rissa:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister.
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(15 - x\) dollars.
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount for Ronnie:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his little sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]

The final amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total and half of it is yellow, we can determine that 6 pints are yellow. The remaining paint is equally divided among red, white, and purple. Therefore, the total amount of paint used for red, white, and purple is \(12 - 6 = 6\) pints. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3:

\[6 \div 3 = 2\]

Thus, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 using the special size box of dishwasher pods.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods.
   - Therefore, the number of pods in the special size box is:
     \[
     100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:**
   - The special size box costs $12.
   - The cost per pod is:
     \[

- After the third day, \(C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches.
- After the fourth day, \(C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches.
- After the fifth day, \(C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since \(C_5 = 0.90112\) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class consists of 12 boys and 12 girls. To find the number of students not on varsity, we first calculate the number of girls and boys on varsity.

- One-third of the girls are on varsity: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\) girls.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\) boys.

Adding these together, the total number of students on varsity is \(4 + 3 = 7\).

The total number of students in the class is \(12 + 12 = 24\).

Subtracting the number of students on varsity from the total number of students gives us the number of students not on varsity: \(24 - 7 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of face masks that Mike bought. Since Mike bought 5 face masks, we calculate thrice this amount as \(3 \times 5 = 15\). Adding 2 more gives \(15 + 2 = 17\).

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Determine the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

The dentist drills 4 teeth. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so the number of teeth capped is \(4 + 7 = 11\). The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100. The total number of teeth is 30. So, the percentage is:
\[
\left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To determine the refund amount, we first calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we find out how much of the milk had passed the expiry date. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk was sour, we calculate:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is based on the cost of the sour milk. Therefore, we calculate the refund as follows:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To find the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to determine the number of 50 kg bags required and then multiply by the cost per bag.

1. Calculate the number of 50 kg bags needed:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags} \]

2. Calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is:
\[ \boxed{306} \]"
"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat.

Each of Kate's 6 friends eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

So, the total number of cheese pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

And the total number of pepperoni pizza slices eaten by all friends is:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we determine how many whole cheese and pepperoni pizza pies are required to provide these slices.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- To find out how many cheese pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of cheese slices by the number of slices per pie:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- To find out how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed, we divide the total number of pepperoni slices by the number of slices per pie:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to calculate the net gain of snowballs per 15-minute interval and then find out how many such intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.

1. **Calculate the net gain of snowballs per 15 minutes:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Determine the number of 15-minute intervals needed to reach 60 snowballs:**
   - Since Jay gains 3 snowballs every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are required to reach 60 snowballs.
   - The number of 15-minute intervals needed is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert the time into hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

"Given that Digimon had its 20th anniversary and John is currently 28 years old, we need to determine Jim's current age.

1. Calculate John's age when Digimon came out:
   \[
   28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim's age at that time was:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. To find Jim's current age, add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out:
   \[
   4 + 20 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

Thus, Jim is currently 24 years old."
"Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister. To find the total number of slices they all ate, we can calculate as follows:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices they all ate is:
\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

Therefore, the total number of slices they all ate is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: Half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(109 - 31 = 34\).

The number of bandages they started with on the first day is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her daily earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Calculate her total earnings for the month.
4. Add the additional amount for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her daily earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate her total earnings for the month.**
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Add the additional amount for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:
\[ 270 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 280 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of fish with red stripes. Given that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we calculate the number of remaining fish after removing those with red stripes:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

From the remaining 44 fish, \( \frac{5}{11} \) have blue stripes:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes. Adding the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes gives:

"Let's calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy initially had:

1. Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each, so the total from the palettes is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors}
   \]

2. She also had three makeup sets with six colors each, so the total from the makeup sets is:
   \[
   3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors}
   \]

3. Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is:
   \[
   8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
   \]

Next, we account for the colors stolen and used:

4. Her sister steals one of the palettes, which has 4 colors, so the number of colors left is:
   \[
   26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors}
   \]

5. Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which has 6 colors. Half of 6 is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors}
   \]
   So, the number of colors left from that set is:
   \[
   6 - 3 = 3 \text{ colors}

"Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, we can determine the height of his two-story house, which is 7 times his height. Therefore, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The height from the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice Mattison's height, so:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Let \( h \) be the height of the second floor. Then:

\[ 180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for \( h \):

\[ h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine how many shells team Gogetters found, we start by calculating the number of shells found by team Alphas. Since team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

This means team Alphas found 280 shells. The remaining shells are:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Next, we calculate how many shells team The finders found. They found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. The remaining shells, which were found by team Gogetters, are:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by calculating the total miles all four dogs need to walk per day based on the average. Given that the average is 3 miles per day for 4 dogs, the total miles needed is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the miles needed for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[ 1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that value. First, we calculate the loan amount:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, he uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We calculate the amount used to pay off the debts:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we find the leftover amount after paying off the debts:

\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

"To determine how much Deandre will earn from selling the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. The weights are as follows:

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."

   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
   \]
   Simplifying the multiplication:
   \[
   72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
   \]
   So, the selling price is $99.

2. **Calculate the Profit:**
   The profit is the difference between the selling price and the buying price:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier over a period of time at different settings.

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

3. **High Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on high setting: \(4 \, \text{liters/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 20 \, \text{liters}\).

Summing the water removed at each setting:
\[3 \, \text{liters} + 6 \, \text{liters} + 20 \, \text{liters} = 29 \, \text{liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"To determine how many balloons were thrown, we start by calculating the total number of balloons filled. Given that there are 10 packs of balloons with 30 balloons per pack, the total number of balloons is:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left. Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is the total number of balloons minus the number of balloons left:
\[ 300 - 12 = 288 \]

Thus, the number of balloons thrown is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we first need to calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose.

For one dose:
- Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine.
- She combines 3 times that amount of the second medicine, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

So, the total amount of medicine in one dose is:
\[ 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:
\[ 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \, \text{doses} = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[ \boxed{448} \]"
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we first need to determine the capacity of John's classes. Given that each of John's classes has \(\frac{1}{8}\) the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity for John's school is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's school} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

The capacity of Ali's school is simply the capacity of his one class, which is 120 students.

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

\[

"Pauline visits the museum three times a year. Initially, the cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. The new cost of one visit is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increase} = 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \]
\[ \text{New cost} = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Pauline continues to visit the museum for 3 more years at the new cost. Over the 5 initial years, she makes:

\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ visits} \]

Over the next 3 years, she makes:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ visits} \]

The total number of visits over 8 years is:

\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \text{ visits} \]

"Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \(x\) feet. The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it is \(4x\) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is given as 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[x + 4x = 40\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[5x = 40\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 5:

\[x = \frac{40}{5} = 8\]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The longer piece, being 4 times the length of the shorter piece, is:

\[4 \times 8 = 32\]

"Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly makes as \( c \).

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. So, the number of brownies she makes can be expressed as \( 3c - 2 \).

Each person in the class gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class. Therefore, the total number of treats is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \).

The total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies, so we can write the equation:
\[ c + (3c - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 4c - 2 = 10 \]

To isolate \( c \), we first add 2 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 4c = 12 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ c = 3 \]

"To determine the total cost Karen would pay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure.
2. Calculate the cost of the nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.
3. Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted cost of the manicure and pedicure.**

- The original cost of a manicure is $35.
- The original cost of a pedicure is $40.
- The discount offered is 20%.

The discount amount for the manicure is:
\[ 35 \times 0.20 = 7 \]

So, the discounted cost of the manicure is:
\[ 35 - 7 = 28 \]

The discount amount for the pedicure is:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]

So, the discounted cost of the pedicure is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \]

The total cost for both the manicure and pedicure after the discount is:
\[ 28 + 32 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the nail art for both the manicure and pedicure.**

- The cost of nail art per nail is $3.
- A manicure involves 10 nails, and a pedicure involves 10 nails.

The total number of nails for both the manicure and pedicure is:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

The total cost for the nail art is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

**Step 3: Add the discounted costs of the manicure and pedicure to the cost of the nail art.**

The total cost Karen would pay is:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Price in November**: The toy was priced at $40.

2. **Price Increase in December**: The price increased by 80%. To find the new price, we calculate 80% of $40 and add it to the original price.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price in December} = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

3. **Price Decrease in January**: The price decreased by 50%. To find the new price, we calculate 50% of $72 and subtract it from the December price.

"To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we first calculate the capacity of one bookcase.

Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold:
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ books} \]

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books} \]

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books} \]

Adding the capacities of all the shelves in one bookcase, we get:
\[ 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

"Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to push the car. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

"Given that Mia is 40 years old and she is 16 years younger than Emma, we can determine Emma's age by adding 16 years to Mia's age. Therefore, Emma is \(40 + 16 = 56\) years old.

To find the average of their ages, we use the formula for the average of two numbers:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Mia's age} + \text{Emma's age}}{2} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
\]

Thus, the average of their ages is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To find the total number of good seashells that Tom, Nancy, and Benny found together, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells they found and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found:
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.
   - Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86

\[
214 + 432 = 646
\]
\[
646 + 86 = 732
\]

So, the total number of seashells found is 732.

2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:
   - Number of cracked seashells = 67
   - Total good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells

\[
732 - 67 = 665
\]

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is \(\boxed{665}\)."

"To determine how many pounds of feed are left after a week, we need to calculate the total feed consumption for Dexter's pigs over that period.

1. **Daily Feed Consumption for One Pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for All Five Pigs:**
   Dexter has five pigs, so the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption for All Five Pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Remaining Feed After a Week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the remaining feed after a week is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. So, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. Therefore, the number of packs John needs to buy is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack costs $2, so the total cost for 6 packs is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"First, calculate the total earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies.

  \[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \]
  So, she earns $40 from cookies.

Adding these amounts together gives her total earnings:
\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the five trays she buys:
- Each tray costs $4, and she buys five trays:
  \[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Subtract the total cost of the trays from her total earnings:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Frances has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Street:**
   - Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - Number of new children joining = 5 (one for each of the original 5 children).
   - Total number of children now = 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - Number of new children joining = 10 (original 10 children) × 2 = 20.
   - Total number of children now = 10 (original) + 20 (new) = 30.

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children leave the group.
   - Total number of children now = 30 (current total) - 5 (original 5 children who left) = 25.

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
3. Let the number of beakers Igor actually brought be \( x \). Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so \( x \) beakers were lost, meaning \( x \) is the number of beakers Igor brought.

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is the sum of the test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, which is given as 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 8 + x + 16 = 29 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 24 + x = 29 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 29 - 24 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract this from the total number of screws James has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we start by calculating the total amount of line required based on the length of the dock. Given that the caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed. He has 6 feet of new line, so the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."
"To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of meals and wine for one reservation.
2. Calculate the total cost for one night.
3. Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of meals and wine for one reservation.**
- Cost of 2 meals: \(2 \times \$5 = \$10\)

- Number of reservations per night: 6
- Total cost per night: \(6 \times \$15 = \$90\)

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the number of nights the restaurant is open in a week.**
- Number of nights the restaurant is open per week: 2
- Total cost per week: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the total amount made in a week is \(\$180\)."
"To find the selling price per watermelon, we first need to determine the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to calculate the selling price per watermelon, given a profit of 25%. The selling price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of the individuals involved and then find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's current age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is now 18, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - The youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is now 37, the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the age of the youngest son in 3 years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of John's youngest son in 3 years will be \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

1. **Calculate the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour:**
   - Ana spends 3 minutes peeling one orange.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour:**
   - Jane spends 4 minutes peeling one orange.
   - Therefore, the number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

3. **Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:**
   - The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) oranges.

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To find the total amount Mark paid, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount and the cost of the mechanic's labor, then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the discounted cost of the radiator:
   - Original cost of the radiator: $400
   - Discount: 80%
   - Discounted cost: \( 400 \times (1 - 0.80) = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \)

2. Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor:
   - Labor rate: $50 per hour
   - Hours worked: 3
   - Total labor cost: \( 50 \times 3 = 150 \)

3. Calculate the total amount paid:
   - Total cost: \( 80 + 150 = 230 \)

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

2. Set up the equations based on the given information:
   - The total number of animals is 20: \( c + k = 20 \)
   - The total number of legs is 70: \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

3. Simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

4. We now have the system of equations:
   - \( c + k = 20 \)
   - \( c + 2k = 35 \)

5. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
   - \( (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \)
   - \( c + 2k - c - k = 15 \)
   - \( k = 15 \)

6. Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
   - \( c + 15 = 20 \)
   - \( c = 20 - 15 \)
   - \( c = 5 \)

Therefore, the number of chickens is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To solve the problem, we first calculate the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to divide these slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. Therefore, each person will get:
\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices each person can have is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
