"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The increase in value is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[ \boxed{70000} \]"

"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the flock:**
   - Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day.
   - Wendi has 20 chickens.
   - Therefore, the total daily feed requirement is \( 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \).

2. **Calculate the amount of feed already given:**
   - In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed.
   - In the afternoon, Wendi gives 25 cups of feed.
   - Therefore, the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon is \( 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \).

3. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement.
   - Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is \( 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \).

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Given this, each pair of glasses (one at full price and one at 60% of the full price) costs:
\[ \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can calculate the total cost by determining how many pairs of glasses there are:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
\[ 8 \times \$8 = \$64 \]

"To determine how far John is from home at the end of his 4-hour return trip, let's break down the journey step by step.

1. **Initial Drive:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles.
   - Next, he drives for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) at 30 mph.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.
   - He then drives the remaining time at 80 mph.
     - Total time left = 4 hours - 2 hours (standstill) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours.
     - Distance covered = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

3. **Total Distance Covered on Return Trip:**
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.
   - Distance covered at 30 mph = 15 miles.
   - Distance covered at 80 mph = 120 miles.
   - Total distance covered on return trip = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

4. **Distance from Home:**
   - Initial distance from home = 180 miles.
   - Distance covered on return trip = 135 miles.
   - Distance remaining from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her regular and overtime pay separately and then sum them up.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering Melanie's sales pattern and the final number of vacuum cleaners she has left.

1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
2. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \). Therefore, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
3. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). After this sale, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left.

We can set up the equation based on the information given:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]

Solving this equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]
Add 2 to both sides:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} = 12
\]

"To find the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first determine each friend's guess:

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so adding 20 gives 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so adding 20 to 80 gives 100.

Now, we calculate the average of these guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily care hours for all dogs.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

To find the number of gold coins, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplify and solve for \( S \):

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, using the second equation to find \( G \):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."

"To determine John's running speed, we need to break down the information given and calculate the distance he runs each day.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**

\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent running and walking:
- Total time: 6 hours
- Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}\)

Next, we calculate the distance traveled while running and walking:
- Distance running: \(6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance walking: \(1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}\)

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

2. **Fraction of Boys**: \( \frac{2}{5} \)
3. **Fraction of Girls in Girl Scout**: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

First, calculate the number of boys:
\[ \text{Number of Boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Next, calculate the number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of Girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Now, calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:
\[ \text{Number of Girls in Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

Finally, calculate the number of girls not in the girl scout:

"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the volume loss**: Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume when turned into sauce. Therefore, the 16 ounces of tomatoes in each can produce 8 ounces of sauce.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used**: Since each can produces 8 ounces of sauce, we can find out how many cans are needed to make 32 ounces of sauce by dividing the total volume of sauce by the volume produced per can:
   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces per can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can**: Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes**: Multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes per can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Thus, Freda used \(\boxed{12}\) tomatoes."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Exiting**: 5 cars take an exit, so they do not drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Cars After Exits**: After the 5 cars exit, the number of cars remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).
4. **Cars Driving Through**: In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
5. **Cars Driving Through First 15 Minutes**: Let \(x\) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \(x + 20\).

Since the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is equal to the number of cars remaining after the 5 cars exited, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary is an avid gardener who received 18 new potted plants from her plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

First, let's calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we determine how many plants she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total she currently has:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery:
\[ 40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To determine the total number of doorbell rings, let's analyze the information provided:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion. The fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pieces**: The total number of pieces in the jigsaw puzzle is 1000.

2. **Pieces Placed by Poppy**: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy.

3. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy from the total.
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   Therefore, 750 pieces are left.

4. **Pieces Placed by Poppy's Mom**: Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, 250 pieces are placed by Poppy's mom.

5. **Remaining Pieces After Poppy's Mom**: Subtract the pieces placed by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces.
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   Therefore, 500 pieces are left to be placed.

The final number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is \(\boxed{500}\)."

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) gives us the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate the total hours Frankie spent watching TV each day.

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering Henry's baking process and the final count of cookies.

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he intended to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies.
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]

"To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

   - From \( J = 6B \) and \( J = 1800 \), we can find \( B \):
     \[
     1800 = 6B \implies B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - Now, using \( B = 50D \), we can find \( D \):
     \[
     300 = 50D \implies D = \frac{300}{50} = 6

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate both her total cost and total selling price.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- Sasha bought ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each, so the cost for these is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).
- She also bought five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each, so the cost for these is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).
- Therefore, the total cost is \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

Next, let's calculate the total selling price:
- The price of the 2x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is \(10 \times 1.5 = \$15\). Thus, the total selling price for these boards is \(10 \times 15 = \$150\).
- The price of the 4x4x10 boards has also increased by 50%, so the new price per board is \(16 \times 1.5 = \$24\). Thus, the total selling price for these boards is \(5 \times 24 = \$120\).
- Therefore, the total selling price is \(150 + 120 = \$270\).

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = \(270 - 180 = \$90\).

Thus, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{90}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves remaining is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the remaining 40 elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we start by calculating his expenditure for June. Given that his expenditure in May was $500 and it was $60 less in June, we can find his June expenditure as follows:

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = 500 - 60 = 440 \]

Next, we add the expenditures of both months to find the total expenditure:

\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = 500 + 440 = 940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June is $940."
"To determine the total number of tickets Pam and Fred used, we need to calculate the total number of rides they took and then multiply by the cost per ride.

First, let's calculate the number of roller coaster rides:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
- Total roller coaster rides = 2 (Pam) + 4 (Fred) = 6 rides.

Next, let's calculate the number of luge rides:
- Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each.
- Total luge rides = 2 (Pam) + 2 (Fred) = 4 rides.

Now, let's find the total number of rides:
- Total rides = 6 (roller coaster) + 4 (luge) = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets used is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using the relationships provided and basic algebra.

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queen bees.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).

The total number of bees in the hive is the sum of queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + B + W = 700 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest. The original price is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months. 

First, convert the percentage increase to a decimal:
\[ 20\% = 0.20 \]

Next, determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods} \]

Now, use the compound interest formula to find the price after 18 periods:
\[ P_{18} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n \]
where \( P_{0} = 20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \).

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366 \]

Finally, multiply the original price by this result:
\[ P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{787.32}\)."
"Given the scenario, we need to determine the total value of the toys in the room. Here are the details:

- 5 red cars, each costing $4.
- 3 action figures, each costing $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ 5 \text{ red cars} \times \$4 \text{ per red car} = \$20 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ 3 \text{ action figures} \times \$5 \text{ per action figure} = \$15 \]

Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times \$5 = \$15 \]

Now, add up the total cost of all the toys:
\[ \$20 \text{ (red cars)} + \$15 \text{ (action figures)} + \$15 \text{ (doll)} = \$50 \]

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we first calculate the total number of eggs required for 15 Spanish flans. Each flan requires 3 eggs, so:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Sandra's neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs received per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions} \]

Therefore, Sandra has to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age and \( S \) represent Seth's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The equation for their ages in 2 years is \( (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \]
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Using \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total cost of each uniform, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The cost of the jacket is three times the cost of the hat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jacket} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her total minimum monthly payment across all her debts. 

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we calculate 50% of the total minimum monthly payment and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:

50% of $1000 = 0.50 * $1000 = $500

Total monthly payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):

$1500 * 12 = $18000

Therefore, the amount Jessica pays in a year is $18000."

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

   - So, they took back 6 pink flamingos.
   - The remaining pink flamingos are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).
   - These 6 pink flamingos were then painted white and put back out.
   - Now, Sue's front yard has 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.

3. **Additional Placement on Sunday:**
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - The total number of pink flamingos is now \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).
   - The number of white flamingos remains 6.

4. **Finding the Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos is \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer:**

"Mark is a copy-editor who edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers. Publisher B pays him twice as much per sentence as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and the total is 1000 sentences, he edits:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B}
   \]

2. **Calculate the payment from Publisher A:**
   Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the payment from Publisher B:**
   Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so Publisher B pays:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence}
   \]
   For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   Adding the earnings from both publishers gives:
   \[
   2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, given her earnings and savings.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the total cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, let's determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting:
- She babysits 4 times and earns $5 each time, so her total earnings from babysitting are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars.

Sara already has $10 saved. Therefore, the total amount of money she will have after babysitting and mowing the lawn is:
\[10 + 20 + 4x = 30 + 4x\]

We need this total to be at least $70 to afford the jacket and shoes:
\[30 + 4x \geq 70\]

To find \(x\), we solve the inequality:
\[4x \geq 70 - 30\]
\[4x \geq 40\]
\[x \geq 10\]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to determine the number of red chickens Jerry has. Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens and \( w \) represent the number of white chickens. According to the problem:

1. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day.
2. Each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so \( w = r + 2 \).

We can set up the following equation based on the total number of eggs collected:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Given the problem, we need to determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, based on their current ages and the relationships between their ages.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

In three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age and \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

First, substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

3. **Understand the relationship between the medals they have and the total medals given out:**
   - The problem states that the total number of medals they have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out.
   - This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals they have together.
   - Therefore, the total number of medals given out is \(10 \times 39 = 390\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{390}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars each child will receive after the adults have been allocated their share.

First, calculate the total number of chocolate bars available:
\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will get:
\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children:
\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, distribute these 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much money Susan earns, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Working Time Calculation:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours.
   - She takes a 30-minute break, so her actual working time is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Convert Working Time to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Number of 10-Minute Intervals:**
   - Each 10-minute interval earns her $5, so the number of intervals in 150 minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals}
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Since she earns $5 per interval, her total earnings are:
     \[
     15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money Susan earns for the online task is \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."

- Total pushups: \(100 + 120 = 220\)
- Total squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Total dumbbell presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Adding these totals together gives us the overall count of activities:
\[220 + 90 + 60 = 370\]

Therefore, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is \(\boxed{370}\)."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.
2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.
3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.
4. Finally, determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household.**

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members in the household, the total consumption per meal is:
\[ 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day.**

Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week.**

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly consumption is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

To find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for \(\boxed{3}\) weeks."
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare it to his target of 120 crates.

First, let's list the number of crates sold each day:
- Over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday): 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Now, we sum up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday and add the weekend sales:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was off by \(\boxed{55}\) crates from his target for the week."

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

"To determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to consider the trade ratio and the number of new records they received. The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. If each person leaves with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records traded as follows:

Since the trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record, for 7 new records, the number of old records traded would be:

\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees.
   - Therefore, the number of junior programmers is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is:
     \[
     100 - 40 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment for junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment to junior programmers is:
     \[
     40 \times 2000 = 80000
     \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment for senior programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid:
     \[
     2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total payment to senior programmers is:
     \[
     60 \times 2400 = 144000
     \]

5. **Calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers:**
   - The total payment is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
     \[
     80000 + 144000 = 224000
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the psychological aspect of tracking changes in the number of people on the bus.

1. Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. So, the number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).

3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. So, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).

4. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \)."

     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Deduction:**
   - The total amount deducted from the $43 purchase is the sum of the reward and the coupon:
     \[
     4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Final Amount Paid:**
   - Subtract the total deduction from the amount spent:
     \[
     43 - 12 = 31 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes and other deductions.

For Job A:
- Annual pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- Tax: 20% of $30,000 = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual pay: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Remaining pay after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on remaining pay: 10% of $36,000 = 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net pay of both jobs:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

The difference in net pay between the two jobs is:
$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to represent the situation described. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Consequently, the smallest group would have \( x - 10 \) students. Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 70 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of students in each of the two larger groups, the smallest group would have:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."

6. **Total cost for Morgan and her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Morgan} + \text{Cost for arcade tokens} = \$25 + \$5 = \$30
   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4
   \]

Since Morgan cannot invite a fraction of a friend, she can invite 2 friends.

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance for one trip between the three cities.
2. Determine the daily distance traveled by the train.
3. Calculate how many days it takes for the train to accumulate 18,000 miles.

First, let's calculate the total distance for one trip:
- Distance from the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- Distance from the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- Distance from the third city back to the first city: \(75 + 100 - 50 = 125\) miles

So, the total distance for one trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the daily distance traveled is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles/day}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the service interval by the daily distance:
\[\frac{18000}{900} = 20\]

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had before selling a portion of it. Let's denote the total amount of land he originally had as \( x \) hectares.

According to the problem, after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, Mr. Ruther had \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land left, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. This can be represented by the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Therefore, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally had is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty given the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Now, add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
\[ 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Finally, subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the original cable package cost to find the savings:
\[ 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the percentage of time Carol spent editing her song, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on all activities. 

1. Writing a song: 4 hours
2. Recording: half the time spent writing, which is \(4 \div 2 = 2\) hours
3. Editing: 90 minutes, which is \(90 \div 60 = 1.5\) hours

Adding these times together gives the total work time:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
\[ \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we need to consider the given probabilities and the total number of candles produced.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and will explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability of both defects} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Apples Gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: \( x \) apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
   \[
   30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
   \]

2. **Apples Gathered by Joanne's Sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
   \[
   60 + 45 = 105
   \]

3. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   Subtract 150 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."

"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which totals to:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we get:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of the question and applying logical reasoning.

1. **Identify the sale prices and savings:**
   - Tattered jeans cost $28.
   - Jogger jeans cost $6 less than tattered jeans, so the sale price of jogger jeans is $28 - $6 = $22.
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

2. **Determine the savings from each type of jeans:**
   - Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6 / 3 = $2.
   - The rest of the savings, which is $6 - $2 = $4, came from the tattered jeans.

3. **Calculate the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - Since the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, the original price of the jogger jeans must be $22 (sale price) + $2 (savings) = $24.

4. **Find the difference between the original price of the tattered jeans and the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.
   - The difference is $28 - $24 = $4.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in psychology.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for a ticket to an amusement park.
   - He sells his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
   - After selling, he has $150 in total (including the $100 for the ticket and $50 in spending cash).
   - He keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.

2. **Calculating the Number of Cards Sold:**
   - The total amount of money from selling the cards is $150 - $100 = $50.
   - Each card is sold for $1.5, so the number of cards sold is $50 / $1.5 = 100/1.5 = 100 * (2/3) = 100 * 0.6667 ≈ 100 cards.

3. **Determining the Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells 2/3 of them.
   - If 2/3 of the cards equals 100, then 1/3 of the cards equals 100 / 2 = 50.
   - Therefore, the total number of cards he started with is 50 * 3 = 150.

**Final Answer:**
150"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the psychological aspects of guest expectations and catering logistics.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests.
   - He prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 guests is 18 guests.
   - So, 18 guests were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each, which means 18 guests × 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - The remaining 18 guests were supposed to have 1 hotdog each, which means 18 guests × 1 hotdog = 18 hotdogs were prepared for these guests.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs.

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - Each of the first 18 guests got 2 hotdogs, so they consumed 18 guests × 2 hotdogs = 36 hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests (40 total guests - 18 guests who already had their hotdogs) each want 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need 22 guests × 1 hotdog = 22 hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs consumed is 36 + 22 = 58 hotdogs.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is 58 - 54 = 4 hotdogs.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"

2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Add the costs of the onions and beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's go through each step:

1. Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
   \[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

2. The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
   \[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

3. He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

"To solve this problem, we need to first convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Given that 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time James took for each segment of the triathlon and then determine the time for the run.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. So, the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon. So, the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. Each raised bed has dimensions of 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( A \) represent Angela's current age.

In four years, Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, three times his current age is \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \).

In four years, Angela's age will be \( A + 4 \). We can set up the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Angela's current age is 38.**"
"To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over 14 days, we need to calculate the total cost for both his morning and afternoon rides.

First, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- Paul drives in the morning every day for 14 days.
- Therefore, the total cost for morning rides is \(6 \times 14 = 84\) dollars.

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally cost-effective, we can set up an equation based on the given costs.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) where the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) represent the number of insects David found. According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to calculate the amount each used and then sum these amounts.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn. Since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to understand the percentage error in her oven's performance. When set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is 18 degrees, and the percentage error is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the given information and applying basic algebra.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jelly beans.
   - The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( R = 0.99B \).
   - The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, so \( G = 1.01B \).

2. **Total Jelly Beans:**
   - The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     R + B + G = 4500
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \):
     \[
     0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3B = 4500
     \]
   - Solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
     \]

3. **Calculate Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   - Number of red jelly beans:
     \[
     R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
     \]
   - Number of green jelly beans:
     \[

"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Given that one angle is twice the smallest angle and another is three times the smallest angle, we can set up the following equation to find the measure of the angles:

Let the smallest angle be \(x\). Then the other two angles are \(2x\) and \(3x\). The sum of these angles is:

\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[6x = 180\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are:

\[2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\]
\[3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine the cost per pump of shampoo, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total number of washings per bottle**: The bottle provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash.
2. **Washings per pump**: Since 2 pumps give 120 washings, 1 pump will give half of that:
   \[
   \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
   \]
3. **Cost per washing**: The bottle costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings:
   \[
   \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing}
   \]
4. **Cost per pump**: Since 1 pump gives 60 washings, the cost for 60 washings is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump}
   \]
5. **Convert the cost per pump to cents**: Since 1 dollar = 100 cents:
   \[

"Given the scenario, let's analyze the situation from a psychological perspective. Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out cost $35. 

First, we calculate the discounted price of the shirt:
\[ \text{Discount on shirt} = 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price of shirt} = 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts do not have a discount, so they remain at $35.

Next, we add the discounted price of the shirt and the price of the shorts to find the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 17.50 + 35 = 52.50 \]

Since Joe only has $50, he does not have enough money to make the purchase. Therefore, he will not be able to buy both items.

The final amount of money Joe will have left is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]

This scenario highlights the importance of budgeting and financial planning, which are crucial skills for managing resources effectively. Joe's situation also underscores the potential for disappointment and the need for realistic financial expectations."

"To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step, considering the total number of seats and the distribution among administrators, parents, and students.

1. **Total Number of Seats**: The auditorium has 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. Therefore, the total number of seats is:
   \[
   4 \times 18 = 72
   \]

2. **Seats Occupied by Administrators**: One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators. So, the number of seats occupied by the administrators is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
   \]

3. **Remaining Seats**: Subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find the remaining seats:
   \[
   72 - 18 = 54
   \]

4. **Seats Occupied by Parents**: One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents. So, the number of seats occupied by the parents is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
   \]

5. **Seats Occupied by Students**: The rest of the seats were occupied by the students. Subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find the number of seats occupied by the students:
   \[
   54 - 18 = 36
   \]

"To determine the total number of functioning street lights, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Calculate the number of street lights per intersection:**
   Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection.
   \[
   4 \text{ street lights/pole} \times 6 \text{ poles} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections:**
   There are 4 intersections.
   \[
   24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights}
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights:**
   There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
   \[
   96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is \(\boxed{76}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pack of Gum**: Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.
2. **Gum Chewing at School**: He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since the school day lasts 8 hours, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after school, he has:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. **Gum Chewing on the Way Home and After Dinner**: He chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After these, he has:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
4. **Giving Half to His Sister**: He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   After giving half to his sister, he has:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{7}\) pieces of gum left."

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, it will take Adam \(\boxed{4}\) years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster."
"To determine how much James made, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
2. Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.
3. Calculate the profit.
4. Calculate James's commission on the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**

James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost to acquire the cars.**

The company paid 30% of the price to acquire each car.
\[

\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

**Step 4: Calculate James's commission on the profit.**

James gets a 10% commission on the profit.
\[
\text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
\]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[
\boxed{17500}

     \]
   - So, 25 riders can stay upright.

2. **Determine the number of men who can stay upright:**
   - We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means 40% are men.
   - Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is:
     \[
     25 \times 0.40 = 10
     \]

Thus, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
2. The price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel.
3. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[
\text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
\]

Next, calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[
\text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
\]

Now, find the total price for all three jewels:
\[

   \]

3. **Rose Stamps:**
   Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

4. **Total Stamps:**
   To find the total number of stamps, we add the number of each type of stamp:
   \[
   16 + 19 + 10 = 45
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the maximum number of missed classes based on the total cost and the number of classes.

Given:
- Total cost for Karate classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

"To determine the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider the number of people who will receive cupcakes and the number of cupcakes each person will get.

First, let's calculate the total number of people:
- Howie himself: 1
- His teacher: 1
- His 25 classmates: 25

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 \text{ people} \]

Next, since each person will receive 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate), we multiply the number of people by 2:
\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, Howie should buy \(\boxed{54}\) cupcakes."

"To address the question from a psychological perspective, we need to consider the cognitive processes and decision-making involved in the purchases made by Clara and Sheila.

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on Tuesday, totaling $400. She received a $2 discount, making her final payment $398. This scenario involves a straightforward calculation and a minor discount, which can be processed quickly and efficiently by most individuals.

Sheila, on the other hand, bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each on Wednesday, totaling $600. She received a 10% discount on the total cost, which is a more complex calculation. The 10% discount on $600 is $60, making her final payment $540.

To find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila, we subtract Clara's final payment from Sheila's final payment:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in psychology.

1. **Understanding the Sales Data:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculating Total Earnings for the First Month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determining Earnings for the Second Month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculating Total Earnings Over Two Months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2100}

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture and then find the difference between the two costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the first mixture is \(5 + 5 = 10\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \(\frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2\) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of the second mixture is \(2 + 5 = 7\) dollars.

Now, we need to find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \(10 - 7 = 3\) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs $3 more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of heads (which is the same as the total number of animals) is 20:
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]
2. The total number of legs is 70. Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs:
   \[
   4S + 2G = 70
   \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[
2S + G = 35
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
S = 15
\]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[
15 + G = 20
\]
\[
G = 5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

This means there are 90 history teachers. The remaining teachers are math teachers, so we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Thus, there are 60 math teachers. Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money each person has and then find out how much they would each have if they shared the total amount equally.

First, let's establish the amount of money Aurelia has:
- Aurelia has $120.

Next, we calculate Kassidy's money:
- Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Aurelia has.
- Therefore, Kassidy's money = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\) dollars.

Then, we find out how much Rayna has:
- Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy.
- Therefore, Rayna's money = \(90 + 60 = 150\) dollars.

Now, we add up the total amount of money:
- Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money
- Total money = \(120 + 90 + 150 = 360\) dollars.

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original length of the dress before any extensions or additions were made. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's establish the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets.
- \( W \) be the age of one of the twins.

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are 44.

We can express these as:
1. \( W = T + 7 \)
2. \( W + T = 44 \)

Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, using the value of \( T \) to find \( W \):
\[ W = T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

First, let's determine Neil's monthly savings. Rong saves 20 coins per month, and Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:

\[ 20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years are:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years are:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

   - Initial cost to go picking: $20
   - Cost per pound: $1.5
   - Pounds of blueberries picked: 30

   Total cost of picking = Initial cost + (Cost per pound × Pounds picked)
   \[
   \text{Total cost of picking} = 20 + (1.5 \times 30) = 20 + 45 = 65
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
   - Cost per pound at the store: $2.5
   - Pounds of blueberries: 30

   Total cost at the store = Cost per pound × Pounds picked
   \[
   \text{Total cost at the store} = 2.5 \times 30 = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - Total cost of picking: $65
   - Total cost at the store: $75

   Savings = Total cost at the store - Total cost of picking
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 65 = 10
   \]

James saved \(\boxed{10}\) dollars compared to buying at the store."
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 500 computers at a new price that is 10% higher than the original planned price of $700 per computer.

First, let's determine the new price per computer:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + (\text{Original Price} \times 10\%) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + (700 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + 70 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 770 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Computers} \times \text{New Price} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 500 \times 770 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 385000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:
\[ \boxed{385000} \]"
"To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calorie contribution from each ingredient and then sum them up.

1. **Eggs**: John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg is 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

2. **Cheese**: John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

3. **Ham**: John uses 2 oz of ham.
   - Ham is 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Adding these together gives the total calories in the omelet:

- Total calories = \(450 + 240 + 80 = 770\) calories.

Therefore, the total number of calories in the omelet is:
770 calories."
"To determine the change you would receive, let's break down the costs step by step.

First, calculate the total cost of the pencils:
- Each pencil costs $0.50.
- You bought 6 pencils.
- Therefore, the total cost for pencils is \(6 \times 0.50 = 3.00\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost of the erasers:
- Each eraser costs $0.25.
- You bought 8 erasers.
- Therefore, the total cost for erasers is \(8 \times 0.25 = 2.00\) dollars.

Now, add the costs of the pencils and erasers to find the total expenditure:
- Total cost = cost of pencils + cost of erasers
- Total cost = \(3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00\) dollars.

You paid $10, so the change you would receive is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of Slices**: Each of the 5 friends ordered one pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Slices Eaten by Bryce and His Two Friends**: Each of these three friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a pizza is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Therefore, the three friends together ate:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices Eaten by the Other Two Friends**: Each of these two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizza. Since each pizza has 12 slices, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a pizza is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices}
   \]
   Therefore, the two friends together ate:
   \[
   2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Total Slices Eaten**: Adding the slices eaten by all five friends, we get:
   \[
   24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Slices Left**: Subtracting the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices, we get:
   \[
   60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then calculate the average time.

First, we know that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog, on the other hand, can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, let's convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Then, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the number of windows smashed for both students' cars and teachers' cars separately, and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the students' cars:
- There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"

So, the vendor saves $350 a week."
"Given the problem, we can approach it from a psychological perspective by breaking down the relationships and calculations step-by-step.

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of marbles Sean has.
   - Let \( C_a \) represent the number of marbles Carl has.
   - Let \( C_l \) represent the number of marbles Cal has.

2. **Establish Relationships:**
   - According to the problem, Sean has 56 marbles, so \( S = 56 \).
   - Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so \( C_a = 4 \times S = 4 \times 56 = 224 \).
   - Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times C_l \). Solving for \( C_l \), we get \( C_l = 2 \times S = 2 \times 56 = 112 \).

3. **Calculate Combined Marbles:**
   - The total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is \( C_a + C_l = 224 + 112 = 336 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional groups are required to form a total of 12 groups from the initial 6 groups of equal size.

First, we calculate the number of students per group in the initial setup:
\[ \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group} \]

Next, we need to find out how many students would be in each of the 12 groups if the total number of students remains the same:
\[ \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group} \]

Since the total number of students (54) is constant, we need to determine how many more groups are required to reach a total of 12 groups from the initial 6 groups:
\[ 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ additional groups} \]

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is:

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the problem into the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays.
   - Each weekday, 60 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekdays is \(60 \times 20 = 1200\).

2. **Weekends:**
   - There are 2 weekend days in a week.
   - In one 4-week month, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.
   - Each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented.
   - Therefore, in one 4-week month, the number of chairs rented during weekends is \(100 \times 8 = 800\).

3. **Total for One 4-Week Month:**
   - The total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is the sum of the chairs rented during weekdays and weekends.
   - This is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

4. **Total for Two 4-Week Months:**
   - Since the pattern repeats, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is \(2000 \times 2 = 4000\).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is **4000**."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the value equivalences and the trades Lorraine makes.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth one small button, so 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons.

3. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth a large button, so 20 large stickers = 20 large buttons.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left.
   - Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 20 large stickers = \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons Calculation:**
   - Small buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60

6. **Total Number of Buttons:**

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( x \) represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house. According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the first house, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \) cases.
- The third house will need double the first house, which is \( 2x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), first combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7x = 500 \]

Then divide both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

Now, we need to find the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house, which is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the exact number of cases, we use the exact fraction:
\[ 2x = \frac{1000}{7} \]

Therefore, the third house will need \(\boxed{\frac{1000}{7}}\) cases of shingles."

"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we can break down the points they earn from enemies, berries, and time.

Let's denote:
- \( E_e \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \) as the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

For Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \) (Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \) (Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \) (Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma)

The points for each player are calculated as follows:
- Points for enemies: \( 10 \times \text{number of enemies} \)
- Points for berries: \( 5 \times \text{number of berries} \)
- Points for time: \( 30 \times \text{seconds left on the timer} \)

So, the total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

And the total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas after accounting for the known costs. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The total cost of all four pizzas is $64.
2. Two of the pizzas cost $30 in total.
3. Subtract the cost of the two known pizzas from the total cost to find the combined cost of the other two pizzas:

"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in psychology.

1. **Initial Condition**: Bob starts with 7 fish, 3 of which are orange and 4 are white.
2. **New Fish Added**: Bob buys 17 more fish from a mixed tank, which includes both orange and white fish.
3. **Final Condition**: After adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote:
- \( O \) as the number of orange fish Bob bought.
- \( W \) as the number of white fish Bob bought.

From the problem, we know:
\[ O + W = 17 \]
\[ 3 + O = 2(4 + W) \]

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ 3 + O = 8 + 2W \]
\[ O - 2W = 5 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( O + W = 17 \)
2. \( O - 2W = 5 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:
From the first equation:
\[ O = 17 - W \]

Substitute \( O \) in the second equation:
\[ 17 - W - 2W = 5 \]
\[ 17 - 3W = 5 \]
\[ -3W = 5 - 17 \]
\[ -3W = -12 \]
\[ W = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish:
\[ O = 17 - W = 17 - 4 = 13 \]

Let's verify:
- Initial orange fish: 3
- Initial white fish: 4
- After buying: 3 + 13 = 16 (orange)
- After buying: 4 + 4 = 8 (white)

Since 16 is twice 8, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party by accounting for the tea consumed and the tea remaining.

First, let's calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
  \[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea:
  \[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon = 4 quarts:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \text{ gallons} \]"
"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. After that, he ordered 100 more candies. To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we need to calculate the total number of candies he now has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold.

1. Calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relationships between the quantities of each ingredient.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   - Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
   - Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
   - The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   z + z + s + s + 2s = 10
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   2z + 4s = 10
   \]
   Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
   \[
   z + 2s = 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( z \):**
   From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
   \[
   z = 5 - 2s
   \]

4. **Determine the Amount of Oil:**
   The amount of oil is \( 2s \). To find the specific value, we need to ensure that \( z \) is a positive quantity. If \( s = 1 \), then:
   \[
   z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3
   \]
   This satisfies the equation, and the amount of oil is:
   \[
   2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has. According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:

\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

   - Money from her mom: $80
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money in her purse.

   Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has is:
   \[
   x + 150 + 80 = x + 230
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the information that she still needs $50 to buy the laptop:**
   \[
   x + 230 = 400 - 50
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   x + 230 = 350
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 350 - 230
   \]
   \[
   x = 120
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10000 + \$800 = \$10800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5000 + \$200 = \$5200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10800 - \$5200 = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is \(\$5600\)."

"To determine how many students are good at math, we can break down the information provided:

- Total number of students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. This can be found by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, we find the total number of students who are good at math by adding those who are good at math only and those who are good at both:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and relationships step by step:

1. Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
2. Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).
3. Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
- You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
- The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of Tasha's earnings from mowing lawns and selling lemonade.

1. **Identify the total earnings and the breakdown of earnings:**
   - Tasha made a total of $80 from both mowing lawns and selling lemonade.
   - Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from selling lemonade.
   - Let \( E \) be the amount Tasha made from mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.
   - Let \( J \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Kamala's lawn was mowed thrice as many times as Joe's, so \( K = 3J \).
   - Alba's lawn was mowed five times as many times as Joe's, so \( A = 5J \).
   - The total earnings from mowing lawns can be expressed as:
     \[
     E = 6J + 6K + 6A = 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from both activities is $80:
     \[
     L + E = 80
     \]
   - Substitute \( E \) with \( 54J \):
     \[
     L + 54J = 80
     \]

4. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - To find \( L \), we need to determine \( J \). Since \( J \) must be a positive integer, let's test the smallest possible value:
     - If \( J = 1 \):
       \[
       L + 54 \times 1 = 80 \implies L + 54 = 80 \implies L = 26
       \]
     - If \( J = 2 \):
       \[
       L + 54 \times 2 = 80 \implies L + 108 = 80 \implies L = -28 \quad (\text{not possible})
       \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only feasible solution is \( J = 1 \), which gives \( L = 26 \).

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from selling lemonade is \(\boxed{26}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the information given and applying logical reasoning.

1. **Identify the current ages:**
   - Duncan's current age is given as 60 years.

2. **Formulate the relationship between Duncan's and Adam's ages:**
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\) years.
   - Four years ago, Adam's age was \(A - 4\) years, where \(A\) is Adam's current age.
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     52 = 2(A - 4)
     \]

3. **Solve for Adam's current age:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     52 = 2A - 8
     \]
   - Add 8 to both sides:
     \[
     60 = 2A
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     A = 30
     \]
   - So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

4. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years:**
   - Add 8 years to Adam's current age:
     \[
     30 + 8 = 38
     \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}

First, calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, add the sizes of both farms to find the total:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of packages Colby completes per hour:**
   - Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
   - Therefore, the number of packages per hour is \(50 - 10 = 40\).

2. **Calculate the total number of packages completed in an eight-hour workday:**
   - Colby works for 8 hours a day.
   - So, the total number of packages completed in a day is \(40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages}\).

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for the day are \(320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars}\).

"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.
2. Determine how many bottles of water John drinks in that time.

First, we know that a normal sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes. An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 4 times as long as a normal one:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in 180 minutes. Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes), we divide the total time by 30 minutes:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes per bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of water John drinks in the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use algebra to determine the number of yellow balloons Benny threw bologna at. Let's denote the number of red balloons as \( R \) and the number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). According to the problem, \( R = 20 \).

Benny throws 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Substituting \( R = 20 \) into the equation, we get:

\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):

\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by the interval for a tune-up:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tuesday:**
   Bruce works for 5 hours.

2. **Wednesday:**
   Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Wednesday is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Thursday:**
   Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. Therefore, the number of hours he works on Thursday is:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total hours worked over the three days:**
   Summing the hours worked on each day:
   \[
   5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}

"To determine how much allowance Julia and Nadine each received, let's break down the expenses and solve the problem step-by-step.

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover these expenses, and they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, given the initial amount and the rate of water being used.

1. **Initial Amount of Water in the Tank:**
   - The pool has 10,000 gallons of water.
   - The tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool.
   - Therefore, the tank is filled with \( \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \) gallons of water.

2. **Rate of Water Usage:**
   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
   - Over 6 days, the total amount of water used is \( 500 \times 6 = 3,000 \) gallons.

3. **Remaining Water in the Tank:**
   - Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank.
   - Remaining water = \( 5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \) gallons.

Thus, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to calculate his remaining budget and then figure out how many tickets he can afford with that budget.

First, let's calculate the total amount Colby has spent so far:
- He has seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays, and each ticket costs $10. So, the cost for these tickets is \(5 \times 10 = 50\) dollars.
- He has seen 8 movies on other days, and each ticket costs $7. So, the cost for these tickets is \(8 \times 7 = 56\) dollars.
- He has had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub costs $8. So, the cost for the popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
- He has had 4 boxes of candy, and each box costs $2. So, the cost for the candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount spent so far:
\[50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130\]

Colby's parents give him $150 each month, so his remaining budget is:
\[150 - 130 = 20\]

On the last day of the month, it is a Friday, so he wants to buy a ticket for that day, a tub of popcorn, and a box of candy. The cost for these items is:
\[10 + 8 + 2 = 20\]

Since his remaining budget is exactly $20, he can afford to buy the ticket, the popcorn, and the candy. Therefore, he can see one more movie on Friday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85000."
"To determine the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

1. **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
2. **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
3. **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
4. **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
5. **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine Peter's age based on the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean, which is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( Pa \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the information provided, we can write the following equations:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substituting \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Dividing by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Peter's age is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

   - Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much money Cameron would save, let's break down the costs step by step.

First, calculate the total time Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

Next, consider the cost structure:
- The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.
- For every additional hour after the 12-hour mark, the cost is 70 pesos.

Cameron will stay for 5 additional hours (17 hours total - 12 hours). The cost for these additional hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

Now, compare this to the cost of a 24-hour stay, which is 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother after ten rounds.

First, let's determine the total number of letters Craig has spelled. Craig has spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we need to find out how many letters Craig's brother has spelled. According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, we can find the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds by adding the number of letters Craig and his brother have spelled:

\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[ \boxed{650} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles from coupons:**
   - Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles.
   - The teacher has 9 coupons.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles from coupons is:
     \[
     9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of bottles given to the students:**
   - There are 29 students.
   - Each student gets 2 bottles.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
     \[
     29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of bottles left for the teacher:**
   - Subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles:
     \[
     900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:
\[
\boxed{842}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount:**
   - James buys 10 CDs at $15 each.
   - Total cost = \(10 \times 15 = \$150\).

2. **Apply the 40% discount:**
   - The discount amount = \(40\% \times 150 = 0.40 \times 150 = \$60\).
   - Total cost after discount = \(150 - 60 = \$90\).

3. **Calculate the money James gets from selling 5 CDs:**
   - He sells each of the 5 CDs for $40.
   - Total money from selling = \(5 \times 40 = \$200\).

4. **Determine the net amount James is out:**
   - Since he sold the CDs for more than he paid for them, the net amount he is out is the initial cost minus the money he got from selling the CDs.
   - Net amount = \(90 - 200 = -110\).

Since the question asks how much money James was out, and the negative value indicates a profit, the correct interpretation is that he did not spend any additional money but rather made a profit of $110. However, the question specifically asks for the money he was out, which in this context means the initial expenditure.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{\$90} \]"

Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the contributions of Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar to the team's total score of 45 points.

Given:
1. Bahati scored the most points.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the points scored by Bahati.
- \( A \) as the points scored by Azibo.
- \( D \) as the points scored by Dinar.

From the information provided, we can write the following equations:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

First, express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

\]

Therefore, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling in minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes:

\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:

\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports."

"Given the scenario, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, 700 more beds are occupied.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is **100**."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Emails Sent Daily**: Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.

2. **Work Emails**: Out of these, 7 are work emails.

3. **Non-Work Emails**: The remaining emails are not work emails. So, we subtract the work emails from the total:
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]
   Therefore, there are 9 non-work emails.

4. **Emails to Family**: Two-thirds of the non-work emails are sent to family. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, 6 emails are sent to family.

5. **Emails to Boyfriend**: The remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. We subtract the emails sent to family from the non-work emails:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]
   Therefore, there are 3 emails that are not sent to family.

6. **Emails to Boyfriend**: One-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]
   Therefore, 1 email is sent to her boyfriend each day.

The final answer is:
\[

"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we need to account for the 20% overstatement by Courtney. If Courtney reported 48 people, and this number is 20% higher than the actual number, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to the problem, Courtney's number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step using the information provided.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
   - Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
   - Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

2. **Total Balls Calculation:**
   - The total number of balls carried by the three boys is the sum of the balls each carried:
     \[
     J + 2J + 4J = 7J
     \]

3. **Given Information:**
   - Jason carried 2 balls, so \( 2J = 2 \).

4. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - From \( 2J = 2 \), we get:
     \[
     J = 1
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Balls:**
   - Substitute \( J = 1 \) into the total number of balls equation:
     \[
     7J = 7 \times 1 = 7
     \]

"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of holes by the end of the third day:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

We know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."

1. **First Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg of the Journey:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Now, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"To determine the number of brownies Greta had left over, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. When she got home, her friends gave her 4 dozen brownies, which is 48 brownies.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

First, we calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, making his brother 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age, so she is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old. 

The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time Andy will spend restringing the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of string and then sum these times.

"To determine the total number of players in both teams combined, we start by identifying the number of players on each team. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, we add the number of players on both teams to find the total number of players:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Boxes Purchased**: Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. **Boxes Given Away**: She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, totaling 4 boxes.
3. **Remaining Boxes**: Subtract the given boxes from the total:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]
4. **Boxes Kept**: She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining boxes:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ boxes}
   \]
5. **Boxes Sold**: Subtract the boxes she kept from the remaining boxes:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ boxes}
   \]
6. **Oranges Sold**: Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges sold is:
   \[
   6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( x \). According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. This can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India, which is:
\[ x + \left( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{3x}{2} + 4 \]

We know that the USA has 50 states, so \( x = 50 \).

Substituting \( x = 50 \) into the expression, we get:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

**Answer: 5 hours**"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cherries each person has and then find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries.

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"Given the information:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

To find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Thursday's Catch**: Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. **Friday's Catch**: He caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday.
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. **Saturday's Catch**: He caught half the amount of his Friday's catch.
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings:
\[

"To determine the number of students leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we find the number of students remaining after accounting for the football players:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Adding the number of football players, cheerleaders, and band members gives us the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

2. Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed.
3. Determine the cost of the petunias.
4. Determine the cost of the sweet potato vines.
5. Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.

Let's break it down:

1. Each basket needs 3 petunias, and Katherine has 5 baskets. Therefore, the total number of petunias needed is:
   \[
   3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}
   \]

2. Each basket needs 2 sweet potato vines, and Katherine has 5 baskets. Therefore, the total number of sweet potato vines needed is:
   \[
   2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}
   \]

3. Each petunia costs $3.00. Therefore, the total cost for the petunias is:
   \[
   15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00
   \]

4. Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50. Therefore, the total cost for the sweet potato vines is:
   \[
   10 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50/\text{vine} = \$25.00
   \]

5. Adding the costs together gives the total amount spent:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many roses can be planted given the soil requirements for other flowers and the total amount of soil available.

First, let's calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil. With 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. With 10 carnations, the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Adding these amounts together gives the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

The total amount of soil available is 30 pounds. Therefore, the amount of soil left for planting roses is:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider the time required for each task separately and then sum them up.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be completed sequentially, the total time required is the sum of the time for peeling and sautering:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

"Given the information, we need to determine Wilfred's age. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. We know the total age of the four children is 20.
2. Akbar is 3 years old.
3. Alessandro is 4 years old.
4. Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.
5. Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the information provided:
\[ A = 3 \]
\[ B = 4 \]
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

We also know that Helene's age \(H\) is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \(H = 2 \times \text{Average age}\), we can substitute the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ H = 10 \]

Now, substituting \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):

3. **Number of People in the Church**:
   - Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
   - Therefore, the number of people in the church is \(\frac{750}{15} = 50\).

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"In this scenario, we have a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) dividing a watermelon. Each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

Given that there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is equivalent to \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is represented by \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

"To solve this problem, we can use basic algebra to determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes as \( p \) and the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes as \( m \).

From the problem, we know:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars. Therefore, the equation for Peter is:
  \[
  4p = 64
  \]
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars. Therefore, the equation for Martha is:
  \[
  7m = 56
  \]

Solving these equations:
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

Now, calculate \( 1400 \times 5.9 \):
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge. Let's denote the initial charge as \( x \).

After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the psychological aspects of guest behavior and hotel management:

1. **Initial State**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Early Checkouts**: 24 guests leave early. This reduces the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Late Checkouts**: 15 guests decide to stay late. This further reduces the number of guests to:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Afternoon Checkins**: The number of checkins is twice the number of late checkouts. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of checkins is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario where he does not get an extension.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - Probability = 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - Probability = 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% (100% - 40%) or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

To find the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework, we subtract this total from 1 (or 100%):

\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

Converting this to a percentage:

\[ 0.898 \times 100 = 89.8\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

89.8%"

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, given that it depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

First, we calculate the retention rate:
\[ 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \]

Next, we raise this retention rate to the power of 3:
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of tiles required.
2. Calculate the total cost based on the number of tiles and their cost per tile.

Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is 1 square foot (1 ft × 1 ft = 1 SqFt).

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is:

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the daily consumption first. Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so each cat consumes:

\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

With 3 cats, the total daily consumption is:

\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Given that Imma has 720 grams of cat food, the number of days this will last is:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\) days."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the psychological aspects of understanding and interpreting the given information.

1. **Total Slices of Pizza**: There are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

2. **Slices Eaten by Each Person**:
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 3 fewer slices than Becky, so Jake ate \(10 - 3 = 7\) slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

3. **Total Slices Eaten**: Adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we get \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information provided.

Let \( D \) represent the time Donovan's part took in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part can be represented as \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning each week, we need to calculate the time spent in classes and the additional time spent on extra learning.

First, let's calculate the time spent in classes:
- John has 8 classes each day (6 normal periods + 2 extra classes).
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- Therefore, the total time spent in classes each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.
- Since he goes to class 5 days a week, the total time spent in classes during the week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the additional time spent on extra learning:
- He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of Saturday and Sunday.
- The weekday class time is 1600 minutes.
- Therefore, the time spent on extra learning each day is \(\frac{1600}{16} = 100\) minutes.
- Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday, the total extra learning time for the weekend is \(100 \times 2 = 200\) minutes.

Now, let's add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
- Total weekly learning time = \(1600 + 200 = 1800\) minutes.

Finally, convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:
- \(1800 \div 60 = 30\) hours.

1. Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.
2. Determine the height after the first bounce.
3. Determine the height after the second bounce.

The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. Therefore, the initial height is:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Then, the ball bounces again to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall, which converts to 72 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:
\[72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}\]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:
\[74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}\]

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:
\[69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}\]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."
"To determine the earnings from the sale of apples, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bags sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

Given that each bag contains 10 apples and the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, the number of bags sold is:
\[ \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples/bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Since each bag is sold for $5, the total earnings are:
\[ 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we can work backwards from the information given. Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

1. After the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were left.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, so they ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \( 1080 \) kilograms.

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted. The room has four walls: two north and south walls, and two east and west walls.

1. Calculate the area of the north and south walls:
   - Each wall is 10 feet by 8 feet.
   - Area of one wall = 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.
   - Total area for both walls = 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

2. Calculate the area of the east and west walls:
   - Each wall is 5 feet by 8 feet.
   - Area of one wall = 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.
   - Total area for both walls = 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

3. Add the areas of all four walls to get the total area to be painted:
   - Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

4. Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:
   - One gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.
   - Number of gallons needed = 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   - Each gallon of paint costs $12.
   - Total cost = 12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144.

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

Initially, there are 12 sodas:
- 3 are shaken
- 9 are unshaken

Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda:
- 3 shaken
- 8 unshaken

Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken and 2 unshaken sodas:
- 2 shaken
- 6 unshaken

Now, there are 8 sodas left, with 2 of them being shaken. The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the ratio of the number of shaken sodas to the total number of sodas left.

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Converting this probability to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is:

\[ \boxed{25\%} \]"
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled and then sum these distances.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is 30 miles per hour.

Calculating the distance each train has traveled in 3 hours:
- Distance traveled by the first train: \(60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\)
- Distance traveled by the second train: \(30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}\)

Adding these distances together gives the total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the two trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

**Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy works.**

- Billy takes 20% of the days off.
- 20% of 50 days = 0.20 * 50 = 10 days.
- Therefore, Billy works on 50 - 10 = 40 days.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.**

- Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day.
- People helped per day = 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.
- Total people helped = 6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"The problem at hand involves determining the number of people inside the church after a wedding ceremony. The information provided includes the number of private cars and buses parked outside the church, as well as the capacity of each type of vehicle. However, the problem does not specify the number of people in each vehicle that attended the ceremony.

Given:
- 12 buses, each carrying 35 people.
- 20 cars, each carrying 3 people.

To find the maximum number of people that could have been transported, we calculate the total capacity of the buses and cars:

\[ 12 \text{ buses} \times 35 \text{ people per bus} = 420 \text{ people} \]
\[ 20 \text{ cars} \times 3 \text{ people per car} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Adding these together gives the maximum number of people that could have been transported:

\[ 420 \text{ people} + 60 \text{ people} = 480 \text{ people} \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of people who attended the ceremony, the maximum possible number of people inside the church is:

"Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks each day at the office. To find out how many hours his lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we first calculate the total time spent on breaks and lunch each day.

Each day, Bobby spends:
- 30 minutes on lunch.
- 2 breaks of 15 minutes each, totaling 30 minutes.

So, each day, Bobby spends \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes on lunch and breaks.

Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, over 5 days, the total time spent on lunch and breaks is:
- \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}\).

Converting 300 minutes into hours:
- \(300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the psychological aspects of problem-solving and logical reasoning.

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

2. **Establish Relationships:**
   - Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
   - Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
   - Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

3. **Solve for \( S \) and \( C \):**
   - Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
     \[
     (S + 12) + S = 30
     \]
     \[
     2S + 12 = 30
     \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of them. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles.

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to ensure that the mixture of water from both mugs is at least 40 degrees for Donny to be able to drink it. Let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces. The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 132 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 68
\]

"To determine the probability that both of Mark's lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the probability of winning for each ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

The probability of winning for the first ticket is given as 20%, or 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning for the second ticket is:
\[ 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[ \boxed{12\%} \]"

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Number of Octuplets**: 8
2. **Number Dressed in Purple**: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6\)
3. **Number Dressed in Blue**: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\)

Next, we calculate the number of octuplets wearing bows:
- All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
- \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\).

So, the total number of bow-wearers is:
\[ 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \]

Now, we need to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. The number of purple-wearers wearing bows is 2, and the total number of bow-wearers is 4. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Converting this probability to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\% \]

Thus, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Land and First Sale:**
   - Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.
   - He sells half of it for $50.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 40 square meters for $50.

2. **Second Sale:**
   - After the first sale, he has \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters left.
   - He then sells another \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining land for $30.
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 40 square meters is \( \frac{40}{4} = 10 \) square meters.
   - So, he sold 10 square meters for $30.

3. **Remaining Land and Final Sale:**
   - After the second sale, he has \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters left.
   - He sells the remaining 30 square meters for $3 per square meter.
   - The money from the final sale is \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

4. **Total Earnings:**
   - The total money earned from all sales is the sum of the money from each sale.
   - Total earnings = $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years of life, let's break down the production by age:

1. **5-year-old tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
2. **6-year-old tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

We know that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree. So, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = 1650\]

"To solve this problem, let's define the lengths of the ropes using variables and then use the given relationships to find the length of the red rope.

Let:
- \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

   - Rissa was given three times as much as Ronnie, which is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **Equal Amount Given to Sister:**
   - Let's denote the amount given to their little sister as \(x\).
   - After giving \(x\) dollars, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original money.

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Rissa's remaining money is \(15 - x\).
   - According to the problem, \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - Simplify the right side: \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\).
   - Therefore, \(15 - x = 12\).
   - Solving for \(x\): \(x = 15 - 12 = 3\).

5. **Calculating Ronnie's Remaining Money:**
   - Ronnie initially had $5 and gave $3 to his sister.
   - Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is \(5 - 3 = 2\).

The final amount of money left with Ronnie is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the problem, we can approach it from a psychological perspective by breaking down the components of the mural and understanding the distribution of colors. The mural uses a total of 12 pints of paint, with half of it being yellow. This means 6 pints are yellow, leaving 6 pints to be distributed among red, white, and purple.

Since the problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can divide the remaining 6 pints equally among these three colors. Therefore, each color (red, white, and purple) uses:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ pints}}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, the mural used 2 pints of red paint.

"To determine how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it needs to be recycled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday:**
   - The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - He used 45% of it on Monday.
   - Therefore, the remaining chalk is \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Determine the number of days the teacher can use 20% of the remaining chalk:**
   - Each day, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's denote the remaining chalk after \(n\) days as \(C_n\). We start with \(C_0 = 2.75\) inches.

- After the first day, \(C_1 = 2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20\) inches.
- After the second day, \(C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76\) inches.
- After the third day, \(C_3 = 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408\) inches.
- After the fourth day, \(C_4 = 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264\) inches.
- After the fifth day, \(C_5 = 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112\) inches.

Since \(C_5 = 0.90112\) inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we find out how much of the milk was sour:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we calculate the refund amount based on the cost of the sour milk:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus got in refunds is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and translate the given information into equations.

Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can express these statements as equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up both apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so he now has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so he now has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, determine how many cheese pizza pies are needed. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Then, determine how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies together:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pies} = 6 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 fifteen-minute intervals.
   - In each fifteen-minute interval, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every fifteen minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every fifteen minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many fifteen-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.
   - Converting 300 minutes into hours, we get \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**
5 hours"
"To determine Jim's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many years ago Digimon came out. Since it is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.
2. Calculate John's age when Digimon came out. John is currently 28 years old, so 20 years ago, he was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old at that time.
4. To find Jim's current age, add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is now 24 years old."
"Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister. To find out how many slices they all ate, we can break it down as follows:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 1 more than Doxa, so she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so he ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices they all ate is:
1 (Doxa) + 2 (sister) + 3 (brother) = 6 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices they all ate is 6."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the usage and replenishment of bandages over the three days.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is: \(12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\)

The correct answer is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information provided about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

Given:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

The miles needed for the first three dogs are:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought them for $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27

- Five dozens equal \(5 \times 12 = 60\) eggs.

Now, calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs:
- Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs.
- The number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is \(\frac{60}{3} = 20\) sets.
- Therefore, the total revenue is \(20 \times 1 = 20\) dollars.

Finally, calculate the profit:
- Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
- Thus, the profit is \(20 - 12 = 8\) dollars.

Therefore, Rose's profit is \(\boxed{8}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
2. Half of the hats are red, so the number of red hats is:
   \[
   \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
3. After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is:
   \[
   100 - 50 = 50
   \]
4. \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue. So, the number of blue hats is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
5. The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is:
   \[
   50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the psychological aspect of problem-solving and logical reasoning.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

2. **Formulate Equations:**
   - According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
     \[ B = 5S - 4 \]
   - The total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
     \[ S + B = 116 \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
   - Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
     \[ 6S = 120 \]
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):
     \[ S = 20 \]

4. **Find the Number of Blueberry Cubes:**
   - Substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
     \[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
     \[ B = 100 - 4 \]
     \[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Test Tubes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is \(16 / 2 = 8\) test tubes.
2. **Petri Dishes**: Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.
3. **Beakers**: Let \(x\) be the number of beakers Igor brought. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so Igor brought \(x\) beakers, and some were lost.

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[24 + x = 29\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of legs per table**: Each table has 4 legs.
2. **Calculate the number of screws needed per table**: Each leg requires 2 screws, so for 4 legs, the number of screws needed per table is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) screws.
3. **Calculate the total number of screws needed for 4 tables**: Since each table needs 8 screws, for 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is \(4 \times 8 = 32\) screws.
4. **Determine the number of screws left over**: James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is \(40 - 32 = 8\) screws.

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"The first basket contains 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it contains \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs. Adding the eggs from both baskets together, we get \(10 + 20 = 30\) eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls, we can break down the contributions as follows:

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, which means Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raised $300.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, which means Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each girl:

Total = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Sarah's amount + Maryam's amount
Total = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700
Total = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is $2180."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the psychological aspects of performance and pacing.

1. **Understanding the Distances:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Aaron ran half the distance, which is 2 miles.

2. **Aaron's Speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Vanessa's Speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - This means Vanessa runs each mile in \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Calculating Vanessa's Time:**
   - Since Vanessa runs at 16 minutes per mile and she ran 4 miles, the total time is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes."
"To determine how much line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of line needed based on the length of the dock.
2. Subtract the amount of line he already has from the total amount needed.

Given that the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there are 200 feet of dock, the total line needed is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Since he already has 6 feet of new line, the amount of line he needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy \(\boxed{594}\) feet of line."

- Total cost per week: \(2 \times \$90 = \$180\)

Therefore, the total amount made in a week is \(\$180\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price per watermelon after a 25% profit has been added to the cost price. 

First, let's calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given a 25% profit. The selling price is calculated by adding 25% to the cost price:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To solve this problem, let's use a system of equations based on the given information. We know that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals, which are either chickens or cows, and these animals have a total of 70 legs.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens.
- \( k \) as the number of cows.

From the problem, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (total number of legs, since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Given that there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices} \]
