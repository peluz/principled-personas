**Total bolts needed: 3**"
"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The value increased by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. An increase of 150% means the value increased by \(1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000\).

So, the new value of the house is:
\[80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000\]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000\]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\[\boxed{70000}\]"

3. Since James runs 3 times a week, the total distance for the week is: \(180 \times 3 = 540\) meters.

Therefore, the total meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily feed requirement for Wendi's flock.
2. Determine the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon.
3. Subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement to find the amount needed for the final meal.

First, we know that each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed per day. With 20 chickens, the total daily feed requirement is:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we know the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, we subtract the amount already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to account for the discount on every second glass. Each first glass costs $5, and each second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

Therefore, the total time to download the file is \(\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}\)."
"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering a distance of \(60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

On his return trip, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, covering 0 miles. He then drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph, covering \(30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}\). Finally, he drives for the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering \(80 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

The total distance covered on the return trip is \(0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \text{ miles}\).

Since he was initially 180 miles away from home and has covered 135 miles on his return trip, the distance remaining from home is \(180 - 135 = 45 \text{ miles}\).

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 45 miles from home."
"Eliza's earnings for the week can be calculated by breaking down her hours into regular and overtime hours and applying the appropriate rates.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate of $10 per hour.
   - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked a total of 45 hours, so the overtime hours are 45 - 40 = 5 hours.
   - Her overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so the overtime rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
   - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"The problem involves calculating the total number of downloads for a program over three months. Here's the breakdown:

1. In the first month, the program had 60 downloads.
2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which is:
   \[ 60 \times 3 = 180 \]
3. In the third month, the downloads reduced by 30%, meaning the program had 70% of the second month's downloads. Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[ 180 \times 0.70 = 126 \]

To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}

"To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is \( \frac{x}{3} \). Therefore, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). After this sale, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18

"To determine the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance, we start by calculating the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance. Given that 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we have:

\[ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Next, we subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students to find the remaining students:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Of these remaining 16 students, 25% enrolled in jazz dance. Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance is:

\[ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

Subtracting the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students gives us the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

To find the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the following calculation:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.60 \times 100\% = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after mixing the orange and pineapple drinks, accounting for the spill.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink before any is spilled. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \text{ liters} \]

After spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, the remaining volume of the orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water is:

"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. Henry's first stop was after 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

First, calculate the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end, we subtract 15 miles from the 40 miles:
\[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots. The cost of the first pair of high heels is $33, and the cost of the second pair is twice that, which is $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This can be expressed as:
\[ B - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

Therefore, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages, which is 7:11. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To determine the average guess of the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to first identify each friend's guess and then calculate the average.

1. The first friend guesses 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guesses 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so 20 more than 40 is 60.
3. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so 25% more than 80 is 100.

Now, we add these guesses together and divide by the number of guesses to find the average:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly care hours are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these as the following equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many jewels Siobhan has based on the information provided about Aaron and Raymond's jewels.

1. First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Therefore, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has \(\boxed{23}\) jewels."

"John initially has 13 lego sets, each sold for $15. Therefore, the total amount of money he gets from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20, which totals:

\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After purchasing the video games, he has $5 left. This means the total amount spent on video games and the leftover money is:

\[ 160 + 5 = 165 \text{ dollars} \]

The amount of money he has left after these transactions is:

\[ 195 - 165 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Since each lego set was sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:

\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs each day and then find his average speed over the week.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's walking and running speeds based on her skipping speed and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.
- Her running speed is four times her walking speed.

First, calculate Dana's running speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, calculate her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, determine the time spent running and walking:
- Total time: 6 hours
- Time spent running: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Time spent walking: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}\)

Calculate the distance traveled while running:
\[ \text{Distance running} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Calculate the distance traveled while walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to consider the participants and the coaches separately.

1. **Participants:**
   - Each school has a girls' basketball team with 5 players and a boys' basketball team with 5 players.
   - There are 4 schools.
   - Therefore, the total number of girls' basketball players is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Similarly, the total number of boys' basketball players is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

2. **Coaches:**
   - Each school sends 1 coach for the girls' team and 1 coach for the boys' team.
   - Therefore, each school sends 2 coaches.
   - There are 4 schools.
   - Thus, the total number of coaches is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 20 \text{ (girls' players)} + 20 \text{ (boys' players)} + 8 \text{ (coaches)} = 48 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David based on the given relationships and then find the difference.

Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 4D = 400 \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
Thus, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:
\[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
Therefore, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:
\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \]

"The problem can be approached by setting up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

According to the problem, in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam. Additionally, 5 cars took an exit, so they did not have to drive through the traffic jam. The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \). Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is also equal to the original number of cars minus the 5 cars that took an exit. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."

2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which means the second friend pressed the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, summing up all the doorbell rings:

\[
20 \text{ (first friend)} + 25 \text{ (second friend)} + 70 \text{ (third friend)} + 60 \text{ (fourth friend)} = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."

"John drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed, every weekday. That's 4 glasses of water per day for 5 days, which equals 20 glasses of water from Monday to Friday.

On weekends, he has water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed, but not with dinner. That's 3 glasses of water per day for 2 days, which equals 6 glasses of water on the weekends.

Adding the water consumption from weekdays and weekends together: 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses of water in a week.

**Final Answer: 26**"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information to set up a proportion.

We know that the fog bank takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ minutes}}{42 \text{ miles}}
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[
10 \text{ minutes} \times 42 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles} \times x \text{ minutes}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
420 = 3x
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = \frac{420}{3} = 140
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps methodically:

1. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy places on the board:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

2. Determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy places her pieces:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750
   \]
   Therefore, 750 pieces are left.

3. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy's mom places:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]
   So, Poppy's mom places 250 pieces.

4. Determine the number of pieces left after Poppy's mom places her pieces:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   Therefore, 500 pieces are left to be placed.

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box to find the inner dimensions.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) from each dimension, the inner dimensions become:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length Ã— width Ã— height:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate the total hours Frankie watched TV each day.

- On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is \(1 + 0.5 = 1.5\) hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \(x\) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is \(0.5\) hours, so the total time for Wednesday is \(0.5x\) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:
\[2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Combine like terms:
\[5.5 + 0.5x = 7\]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
\[0.5x = 1.5\]

Divide both sides by 0.5:
\[x = 3\]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he intended to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies.
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
7. Next, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."

"The problem presented involves calculating the amount of water that entered Julia's boat while she was rowing back to the shore. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the total distance to the shore:**
   - Julia takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - The shore is 64 seconds away.
   - Therefore, the total distance to the shore is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the rate of water intake:**
   - The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
   - Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
     \[
     \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water taken on:**
   - Multiply the total distance by the rate of water intake:
     \[
     \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve this problem, we need to establish the relationships between the capacities of the phones and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

1. Let \( B \) represent the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
2. Let \( D \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

From the problem, we know:
- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
- Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

First, we express the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phone capacities:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Brittany's phone capacity and the number of ducks:
\[ B = 50D \]

Substituting the value of \( B \) we found:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate both her total cost and total selling price for the lumber she has.

First, let's calculate the total cost:
- Sasha bought ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each, so the cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).
- She also bought five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each, so the cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).
- Therefore, the total cost is \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

Next, let's calculate the total selling price:
- The price of the 2x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is \(10 \times 1.5 = \$15\). The total selling price for these boards is \(10 \times 15 = \$150\).
- The price of the 4x4x10 boards has increased by 50%, so the new price per board is \(16 \times 1.5 = \$24\). The total selling price for these boards is \(5 \times 24 = \$120\).
- Therefore, the total selling price is \(150 + 120 = \$270\).

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
- Profit = Total selling price - Total cost = \(270 - 180 = \$90\).

Thus, Sasha's profit is \(\boxed{90}\)."

\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Next, we need to find out how many of these unicorns are female. Since two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is \(\boxed{6}\)."

"Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions and another test today that consisted of 100 questions. He completed both tests at a rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one.

First, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the first test:
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time: 8 hours
- Questions completed: \(5 \times 8 = 40\) questions

Since the first test had 75 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the first test is:
- Total questions: 75
- Questions completed: 40
- Questions left incomplete: \(75 - 40 = 35\)

Next, let's calculate the number of questions Mark completed in the second test:
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time: 6 hours
- Questions completed: \(5 \times 6 = 30\) questions

Since the second test had 100 questions, the number of questions he left incomplete in the second test is:
- Total questions: 100
- Questions completed: 30
- Questions left incomplete: \(100 - 30 = 70\)

To find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
- Incomplete questions from the first test: 35
- Incomplete questions from the second test: 70
- Total incomplete questions: \(35 + 70 = 105\)

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs in a candy machine based on the relationship provided and the number of blue gumballs.

The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs as \( P \).

The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

We are given that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( B = 12 \). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Performing the multiplication and addition:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we start by identifying the number of each type of car available for rent. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total cars) Ã— 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) Ã— 100 = 0.2 Ã— 100 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and relationships given:

- Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( B = 2Q \) (twice as many baby bees as queens).
2. \( W = 2B \) (twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
3. The total number of bees is 700: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).

Substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q. \]

Now substitute \( B = 2Q \) and \( W = 4Q \) into the total number of bees equation:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700. \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7Q = 700. \]
Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100. \]

Now that we know \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200, \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400. \]

So, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. There is a 10% tax on all non-food items. 

First, we identify the food and non-food items:
- Food items: Milk ($2), Eggs ($3)
- Non-food items: Light bulbs ($3), Cups ($3), Roach traps ($4)

The total cost of the non-food items before tax is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

The tax on the non-food items is 10%, so the tax amount is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

The total cost of the non-food items after tax is:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

The total cost of the food items is:

"To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate both his total income and his total expenses, then find the difference between the two.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients:
- Kim currently has 3 clients.
- He is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Therefore, the total number of clients is \(3 + 5 = 8\).

Next, we calculate the expenses for each client:
- Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each and 1 pack of cloths at $5 each.
- The cost per client is \(2 \times 2 + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9\) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total expenses for all clients:
- With 8 clients, the total expenses are \(8 \times 9 = 72\) dollars.

Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

Finally, we calculate the profit:

So, the profit Kim will make each week is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars."
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare that John can harvest in one harvest.
2. Determine how many harvests John can make in a year.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Therefore, the total number of pineapples per harvest is:
\[ 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, the number of harvests per year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests} \]

The total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we start by defining the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has as \(D\).

Given that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can write the equation:
\[3D = 12\]

Solving for \(D\), we divide both sides by 3:
\[D = \frac{12}{3} = 4\]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has can be calculated as:
\[4D = 4 \times 4 = 16\]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends.

Final answer: 16"
"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school and then find the difference between these times.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The difference in time between Tim and Steve is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

"Shawnda provides a bike inflation service based on the number of tires inflated. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. 

- For bicycles: 5 people each with 2 tires, so \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires.
- For tricycles: 3 people each with 3 tires, so \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires.
- For unicycles: 1 person with 1 tire, so \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire.

Adding these together, the total number of tires inflated is \(10 + 9 + 1 = 20\) tires. 

Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost is \(20 \times 25 = 500\) cents. Converting cents to dollars, we get \(500 \div 100 = 5\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Shawnda made that day is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."

"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, we need to work through the sequence of events step by step, starting from the end and moving backward.

1. After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left.
2. Before the ants, there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. Before the raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, let \(y\) be the number of fries before the raccoon. The raccoon stole \(\frac{2}{3}y\), leaving \(\frac{1}{3}y = 6\). Therefore, \(y = 6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. Before the pigeons ate, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. Before the seagull ate, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. Before Dave ate, there were \(34 + 14 = 48\) fries.

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can use the formula for compound interest.

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( \$20 \)
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

2. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}
   \]

3. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the compound interest formula:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366
   \]

6. **Multiply the original price by the result:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times 39.366 \approx 787.32

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age and \( S \) represent Seth's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, in 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The equation for their ages in 2 years is:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her total minimum monthly payment for all her debts. The minimum payments are as follows:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we need to calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the amount Jessica pays in a year is:
\[ \boxed{18000} \]"

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities
To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we calculate the ratio of the two probabilities and then convert it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

Therefore, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"To determine the daily insect consumption for a flock of ten ducks, we start by calculating the total weekly consumption for the entire flock. Each duck requires 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly consumption is:

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly consumption into a daily consumption by dividing the total weekly consumption by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Number of Trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net Increase in Trees Per Year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of Trees After 10 Years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:

To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the number of sentences he edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits:

\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A} \]
\[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B} \]

Next, we calculate the payment from Publisher A. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so Publisher B pays:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For 500 sentences from Publisher B, Mark earns:

\[ 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us Mark's total weekly earnings:

\[ 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{7500} \]"
"Baldur collects water from a well, getting 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. Each pail contains 5 liters of water. To find the total amount of water he collects daily, we first calculate the total number of pails:

\[ 5 \text{ pails (morning)} + 6 \text{ pails (afternoon)} = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Next, we multiply the total number of pails by the amount of water each pail contains:

\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is \(\boxed{55}\) liters."
"John wins an award at work, which includes a one-time monetary reward of $5000 and a 5% raise in his salary. His original weekly salary is $2000. 

First, calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = 2000 + (2000 \times 0.05) = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the annual salary with the raise:
\[ \text{Annual Salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, add the one-time monetary reward to the annual salary:
\[ \text{Total Annual Earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money John made that year is:
\[ \boxed{114200} \]"
"To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.
2. Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.

**Step 1: Calculate the total tons of grapes produced per year.**

Josie has 10 acres of land, and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year. Therefore, the total tons of grapes produced per year is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

**Step 2: Convert the tons of grapes into barrels of wine.**

Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, the total barrels of wine produced per year is:
\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which is 7 days in a week.
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) slices.

2. **Cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet used 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet used \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices.

3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish.

Adding up all the slices of cheese used:
\[14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 31\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has, we need to account for all the pens she originally had and the pens she bought.

1. Janet initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens.
2. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens. Therefore, the total number of blue pens is:
   \[
   6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ blue pens}
   \]
3. She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ red pens}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the pens:
\[
22 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (yellow)} + 54 \text{ (blue)} + 12 \text{ (red)} = 98 \text{ pens}
\]

Thus, the total number of pens Janet has now is \(\boxed{98}\)."

"To determine the total kilometers Micheal rode, we need to break down the problem into two parts and then sum the distances.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode 5 times a week.
- Each ride was 25 kilometers.
- He did this for 4 weeks.

The total distance for the first four weeks is:
\[ 5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance for the following three weeks:
- Micheal rode 2 times a week.
- Each ride was 60 kilometers.
- He did this for 3 weeks.

The total distance for the next three weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km} \]

Now, we sum the distances from both periods to get the total distance:
\[ 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Micheal rode is:
\[ \boxed{860} \]"
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then sum them up.

Given:
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40g.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- There are 80 candied apples.

First, we calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we need to find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days. We add the number of cakes bought each day:

\[
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76
\]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per cup given the relationship between the cost of cups and plates.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens and \( w \) be the number of white chickens. According to the problem, each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, and each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which can be expressed as \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be represented by the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which totals 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the total number of customers counted on the first and second days from the overall total:

\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool in gallons, and \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool in gallons.

From the problem, we know that both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.

The problem states that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

The problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B = 4S \]

We can substitute \( B = 4S \) into the first equation:
\[ 4S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ 4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S = 8 \) gallons.

The final answer is:

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to calculate the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and agreed to return it with an additional 10%.

The additional amount is:
\[ 2000 \times 0.10 = 200 \]

So, the total amount to be returned is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months, so the total payment is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount paid from the total amount to be returned:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then will be:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years based on their current ages.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

In three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there are 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest is:
   \[
   120 \times 0.30 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took the 36 ready ones home is:
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84
   \]
3. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons are ready for harvest. So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:
   \[
   84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 63
   \]
   Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after harvesting these 63 is:

"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Consumption:**
   - Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
   - His girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, so she eats \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) cherry tomatoes per day.

2. **Total Daily Consumption:**
   - Combined, they eat \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) cherry tomatoes per day.

3. **Weekly Consumption:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, they eat \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \) cherry tomatoes per week.

4. **Vine Production:**
   - Each vine produces 3 cherry tomatoes per week.

5. **Number of Vines Needed:**
   - To find the number of vines required, divide the total weekly consumption by the weekly production of one vine: \( \frac{63}{3} = 21 \).

Therefore, Steve needs \(\boxed{21}\) vines."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
2. Determine how many pizzas are required based on the number of slices per pizza.

"To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of converting empty pens into full pens and how it affects the total number of pens Ram has.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **Conversion Process**: For every 5 empty pens, Ram can make 1 new pen. This means that from the initial 25 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]
3. **Total Pens After First Cycle**: After using the 25 pens to make 5 new pens, Ram now has:
   \[
   25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \text{ pens}
   \]
4. **Second Conversion**: Now, Ram has 5 pens. He can use these 5 pens to make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]
5. **Total Pens After Second Cycle**: After using the 5 pens to make 1 new pen, Ram now has:
   \[
   5 - 5 + 1 = 1 \text{ pen}
   \]
6. **Final Check**: With 1 pen left, he cannot make any more new pens since he needs 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is:
\[
25 + 5 + 1 = 31
\]

**Final Answer**:
\[
\boxed{31}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of Pen Pals Left**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. Therefore, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Letters Sent and Received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters. Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

3. **Total Pages Written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.

4. **Time Spent Writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.

5. **Convert Minutes to Hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. The correct answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since there are two aquariums, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).

The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and in the second aquarium, it is 32. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is \( 32 - 4 = 28 \).

According to the problem, this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Thus, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days and then convert that into calories.

First, let's calculate the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.
- Therefore, Sue's sister ate a total of \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so she ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.
- Therefore, Sue ate a total of \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies.

Next, we calculate the total calories consumed by each of them:
- Each cookie has 200 calories.
- Sue's sister consumed \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories.
- Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Finally, we find the difference in calories consumed:

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to break down the process into three steps:

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:** This takes 20 minutes.
2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:** This takes 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. 
   - 40% of 20 minutes is \(0.40 \times 20 = 8\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.
3. **Cooking the chicken:** This takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Adding these times together gives the total time:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag contains 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it contains \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag contains half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it contains \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we sum the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

The total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines

"Given that the sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20, we need to determine the sum of their ages in 10 years.

In 10 years, each of their ages will increase by 10 years. Therefore, the total increase in their combined age will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years.

Adding this to their current combined age:
\[ 20 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age and \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam: \( R = 6S \).
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam: \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \).

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:

\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas combined and then find half of that total.

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:
\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:
\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:
\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding and printing process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, produces four pages: two on the front and two on the back.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages produced per piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books sold over the three years.
2. Determine the number of books sold in the first and third years.
3. Use this information to find the number of books sold in the second year.
4. Calculate the earnings from the second year's sales.

First, we know the total number of books in the collection is 250, and there are currently 50 unsold books. Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Next, we know that Elise sold 45 books this year and 90 books in the first year (since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year):
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ (incorrect, should be 90)} \]

So, the number of books sold in the second year is:
\[ 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Each book sells for $20, so the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
\[ 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:
\[ \boxed{1300} \]"
"Watson works a 10-hour shift each day for five days a week, which totals 50 hours per week. He earns $10 per hour, so his weekly earnings from his hourly wage are:

\[ 50 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500/\text{week} \]

Since the company performed well for the entire month of April, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week. Therefore, his total weekly earnings including the bonus are:

\[ \$500 + \$300 = \$800/\text{week} \]

April typically has 4 weeks, so his total earnings for the month are:

\[ \$800/\text{week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = \$3200 \]

Thus, Watson made \(\$3200\) in April."

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannonâ€™s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

     \[
     100 - 40 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the monthly payment to junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment to junior programmers is:
     \[
     40 \times 2000 = 80000
     \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment to senior programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid:
     \[
     2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total payment to senior programmers is:
     \[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students in the smallest group when a class of 200 students is divided into three groups, with two groups being equal in number and the third group being 10 students smaller than each of the other two.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group would be \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups, which can be expressed as:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) be the number of chickens.

2. According to the problem, Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[ H = 2C \]

3. The total number of animals is 60:
   \[ H + C = 60 \]

4. Substitute \( H = 2C \) into the total number of animals equation:
   \[ 2C + C = 60 \]
   \[ 3C = 60 \]
   \[ C = 20 \]

5. Calculate the number of chickens:
   \[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

6. Calculate the total number of legs:
   - Cows have 4 legs each.
   - Chickens have 2 legs each.
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
   \[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Given the problem, we need to determine the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. We are provided with the weight of the pink frog, which is 50 pounds, and relationships between the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so:
   - Blue beetle = 50 pounds
   - Green toad = 50 pounds

2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so:
   - Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, we calculate the total weight of the container and the animals:
- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 30 pounds
- Container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

"To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on his vacation. We know that the time spent boating and swimming, along with watching shows, accounts for 30% of his total vacation time.

John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which is 3 hours. So, the total time spent on boating and swimming is:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so the total time spent watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then we have:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
To find \( T \), we solve for \( T \) by dividing both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:

   \]

7. **Remaining budget after accounting for Morgan and arcade tokens:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60
   \]

8. **Cost for each friend (excluding arcade tokens, as Morgan already has $5 for herself):**
   \[
   \text{Cost for each friend} = \$25
   \]

9. **Number of friends Morgan can invite:**
   \[
   \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost for each friend}} = \frac{\$60}{\$25} = 2.4

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"To determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally had, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the total amount of land he originally had. According to the problem, he sold \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, leaving him with \( \frac{2}{5} \) of his land, which is equal to 12.8 hectares. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{2}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{2} \):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty given the ratio and the total number of popsicles.

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles. Together, they have 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has \( 5 \) parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has \( 6 \) parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total steps taken before the jog:
   - Steps taken to and from school: 5,000
   - Steps taken with his friend: 1,000
   - Total steps before the jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000

2. Determine the total steps taken including the jog:
   - Total steps needed: 10,000
   - Steps left after the jog: 2,000
   - Total steps taken including the jog: 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000

3. Calculate the steps taken during the jog:
   - Steps taken before the jog: 6,000
   - Total steps taken including the jog: 8,000
   - Steps taken during the jog: 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time required for him to read the book and then account for the time it takes to get to the airport.

1. Calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

2. Determine the time it takes for Toby to read the book at his reading rate of 300 words per minute:

"Sally went to the seashore for vacation and was given $10 by her parents to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- The seashells cost $1.50.
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- The total cost is $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
- $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final amount of money Sally has left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total amount Tim spent on fireworks, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cookies into dozens.

Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we need to consider the given probabilities and the total number of candles produced.

Given:
- Total number of candles = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 1%
- Percentage of candles that smell like wet dog = 5%

First, calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that will explode} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

Assuming the defects are independent, the probability that a candle both smells like wet dog and will explode is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ \text{Probability of both defects} = 5\% \times 1\% = 0.05 \times 0.01 = 0.0005 \]

Now, calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ \text{Number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode} = 0.0005 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discount price of one blouse.
2. Multiply the discount price by the number of blouses Misha picked.

The original price of each blouse is $20, and they are on sale at 30% off. This means each blouse is now 70% of the original price.

The discount price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Misha picked 4 blouses, so the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Apples Gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: \( x \) apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathers is:
   \[
   30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
   \]

2. **Apples Gathered by Joanne's Sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathers is:
   \[
   60 + 45 = 105
   \]

3. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   Subtract 150 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

Thus, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( c \) be the number of camels.
- \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each camel and each dromedary has one head, we can write:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]
2. The total number of humps is 304. Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, we can write:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To solve for \( c \) and \( d \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Subtracting 124 from both sides gives:
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the distances for each segment of his trip and then sum them up.

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Distance per day: 200 km
   - Total distance: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \)

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Distance: 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days
   - Total distance: \( 800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km} \)

3. **Next Day (Day 7):**
   - Distance: 0 km (he was not traveling)

4. **Second Week (Days 8 to 14):**
   - Distance per day: 300 km
   - Total distance: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \)

Now, summing up all the distances:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

   \]

Thus, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"To determine how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we first need to calculate the elevation of the comb. Stanley was initially at 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, so the comb is now at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver is at 3,000 feet. Therefore, Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

The correct answer is 3,000 feet."

"Initially, there were 50 cats on a rock. Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each, which totals to:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Subtracting these 20 cats from the initial 50, we get:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 that were left, we get the number of cats remaining on the rock:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"

"The problem involves calculating the original cost difference between two types of jeans based on sale prices and savings. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \(28 - 6 = 22\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

3. **Determine the savings from each type of jeans:**
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) dollars.
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Find the original price of the jogger jeans:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cards Kenny started with. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Money Needed and Spent:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Number of Cards Sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

3. **Total Number of Cards:**
   - Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the rest.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards he started with.
   - He keeps 1/3 of them, so he sells 2/3 of them.
   - The number of cards he sold is 2/3 of \( x \), which we know is 100.

"The problem presented involves a scenario where a food caterer prepared hotdogs for 36 guests but ended up with 40 guests, and the caterer needs to determine how many guests did not get a second hotdog.

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hotdogs each.
   - Half of 36 is 18 guests, so 18 guests were to have 2 hotdogs each, totaling \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 18 guests were to have 1 hotdog each, totaling \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \(36 + 18 = 54\).

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - The 18 guests who were supposed to have 2 hotdogs each consumed \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests each want 1 hotdog, so they need \(22 \times 1 = 22\) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \(36 + 22 = 58\).

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \(58 - 54 = 4\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gasoline in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers, we find the amount of gas per container as follows:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container} \]

Next, we need to find out how much gasoline Josey required. Josey needed \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a container, and since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

To convert gallons to pints, we use the conversion factor that 1 gallon equals 8 pints. Therefore, we multiply \(\frac{3}{4}\) gallons by 8 pints per gallon:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Thus, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.

The final answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candy bars George bought after purchasing 3 bags of chips and spending a total of $4.95.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 3 bags of chips:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 0.40 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars:
\[ 4.95 \text{ dollars} - 1.20 \text{ dollars} = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to determine how many candy bars were bought. Each candy bar costs 0.75 dollars, so we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost per candy bar:
\[ \frac{3.75 \text{ dollars}}{0.75 \text{ dollars per candy bar}} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought \(\boxed{5}\) candy bars."

Next, we need to determine how many people will be sharing these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends, so the total number of people is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Therefore, each person will get \(\boxed{7}\) oranges."
"To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of onions Antoine will use.
2. Calculate the total cost of the onions.
3. Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
4. Add the costs of the onions and beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients.
5. Divide the total cost by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.

Let's go through each step:

1. Antoine doubles the recipe, which originally calls for 2 pounds of onions. Therefore, he will use:
   \[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

2. The cost of the onions is $2.00 per pound, so the total cost for the onions is:
   \[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 \]

3. He needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:
   \[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00 \]

4. The total cost of the ingredients is:
   \[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

5. The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:
   \[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

Therefore, the cost per serving is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the total time each person takes to reach the theater and then account for the 5-minute difference Bernadette wants to maintain.

Wayne's travel time to the theater is 4 minutes. Bernadette's travel time is four times that of Wayne, which is:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater, Bernadette needs to leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to account for her 16-minute travel time and the 5-minute lead she wants to maintain:
\[ 16 - 4 + 5 = 17 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start by converting the given length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle, which is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
Given that the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has than the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ (1 + 2) \times 20 = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ pieces} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

The total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ (3 + 4) \times 20 = 7 \times 20 = 140 \text{ pieces} \]

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
\[ 140 - 60 = 80 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final answer is:

"The problem presented involves a series of temperature changes in Marcus's house. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.

2. **Baking for 3 Hours**: The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Over 3 hours, the temperature increase is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after baking is:
   \[
   40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Opening the Window for 30 Minutes**: The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. Over 30 minutes, the cooling effect is:
   \[
   \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]
   So, the temperature after opening the window is:
   \[
   55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
   \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"Given the scenario, we need to determine how long it took James to complete the run in the triathlon, based on the information provided.

First, let's calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, so the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

Therefore, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer: \(\boxed{59}\)"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Converting this to minutes:
   \[
   1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:
   \[
   75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the length of Movie A is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the hay consumed by Michael's horse and then calculate the change Michael receives after making the purchase.

First, let's calculate the distance the horse runs. The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes, which is half an hour. Therefore, the distance covered is:
\[ 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse consumes. The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs. So, for 16 miles, the horse consumes:
\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has six $5 bills, which means he has:
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael receives after buying the hay is:
\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine the cost of the potting soil, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.
2. Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.
3. Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.
4. Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed.**

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed, the dimensions are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:
\[ V = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume of soil required for all 10 raised beds.**

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:
\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of bags of potting soil needed.**

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.**

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of carrot sticks Matt must eat to be able to have five cookies, given the conditions set by his dad.

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \( x \).

According to the conditions:
- Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats.
- Additionally, he gets two extra cookies for cleaning his room.

This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's define the sets as follows:
- \( D \) is the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( P \) is the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

We are given:
- \( |D| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |P| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |D \cap P| = 3 \) (number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion, the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) is:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player compared to Gabriel. 

First, we calculate the number of songs Luri has:
- Gabriel has 20 songs.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has \(3 \times 20 = 60\) songs.

Next, we determine the capacity of each player:
- Each player can store up to 100 songs.

Now, we calculate how many more songs each can add:
- Gabriel can add \(100 - 20 = 80\) songs.
- Luri can add \(100 - 60 = 40\) songs.

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:

"To determine the cost per individual razor after the discounts, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - For 2 packs, the total number of razors is 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors.

4. **Cost per Razor:**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00.
   - The cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25 per razor.
   - Converting this to cents, $0.25 = 25 cents.

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we can set up an equation based on the given costs.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) where the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."

- 2 packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- 1 pack of grape gum, which costs $2.
- 1 pack of green apple gum, which costs half as much as the grape gum, so it costs \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

The total cost for all the gum is $7. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2.
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total cost for the snowshoes is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we need to calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass and then compare it to the cost of the pass.

First, calculate the daily cost of her bus trips:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40/\text{day} \]

Next, calculate the weekly cost of her bus trips:

The cost of the weekly bus pass is \$20.00. Therefore, the savings from buying the weekly bus pass is:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.

First, let's determine the number of cows in the zoo:
- The farm has 30 cows.
- The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.

Next, let's determine the number of sheep on the farm:
- The zoo has 20 sheep.
- The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) sheep.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
- The farm has \(30\) cows + \(10\) sheep = \(40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60\) cows + \(20\) sheep = \(80\) animals.

Therefore, the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

**Final Answer:**

"To solve the problem, let's define the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can express these as the following equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the value of \( L \) to find \( H \):
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

"To determine the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the weeks where he worked out for 4 hours, and the specific weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours.

First, we calculate the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours. Since he worked out for 4 hours every week except for the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours, and there are 8 weeks in total, we subtract the weeks where he worked out for 5 or 6 hours from the total weeks:

- He worked out for 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks.
- He worked out for 6 hours for 1 week.

So, the number of weeks he worked out for 4 hours is:
\[ 8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Next, we calculate the total hours for these 5 weeks:
\[ 5 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the total hours for the weeks where he worked out for 5 hours:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

And for the week where he worked out for 6 hours:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together gives us the total number of hours he spent working out over the 8 weeks:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"The problem involves tracking the number of passengers on a bus after a series of stops. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, leaving:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers}
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, leaving:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers}
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers}
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[

"To determine the total thickness of the four books, we need to calculate the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - $18 is shared among 3 boys, so each boy initially gets:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He then spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Tripling the Amount:**
   - He triples the amount he has left after spending the $8:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to meet his target, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total Days in April**: 30 days.
2. **First Half of April**: 15 days.
3. **Second Half of April**: 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of April. According to the problem, he saves twice as much each day in the second half, which is \( 2x \).

The total savings for the first half of April is:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings for the second half of April is:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

Since \( x \) is the amount saved each day in the first half, the amount saved each day in the second half is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save \(\boxed{50}\) dollars each day in the second half of April."

"To solve the problem where Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars with Jeff getting 4 times as much as Brad, we can set up an equation to represent the distribution of the money.

Let \( B \) be the amount of money Brad receives. Then, Jeff receives \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jeff gets is \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"To determine how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's sorted play set.
2. Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information given.

James's play set has 80 toys. Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set is:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"To determine how much Daniel has to spend on the items he wants to buy, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before applying the discount and then apply the discount to find the final amount.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12 each: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set at $10 each: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the amount Daniel has to spend is \(\boxed{27.00}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be Shiloh's current age, and \( N \) be his nephew's current age. We know that Shiloh is currently 44 years old, so \( S = 44 \).

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \). At that time, his nephew's age will be \( N + 7 \). According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(N + 7) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Distribute the 3 on the right side of the equation:
\[ 51 = 3N + 21 \]

2. Subtract 21 from both sides to isolate the term with \( N \):
\[ 51 - 21 = 3N \]
\[ 30 = 3N \]

3. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{30}{3} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to calculate the percentage error in her oven's temperature. The oven is set to 450 degrees but actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 468 - 450 = 18 degrees. The percentage error is:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let \( T \) be the temperature Maggie should set. The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
\]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to \(\boxed{500}\) degrees."

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

We can express these relationships as:
\[ R = 0.99B \]
\[ G = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the production rates of Ruiz and Marissa and then calculate their total production over 12 hours.

First, let's find Ruiz's hourly production rate. Ruiz can produce 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours, so his hourly rate is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we calculate Marissa's hourly production rate. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, Marissa's hourly rate is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the total production for each over 12 hours. Ruiz's total production in 12 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

Marissa's total production in 12 hours is:
\[ 90 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together:

"To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to break down the earnings into two periods and then sum them up.

1. For the first four hours:
   - Patrick sold 15 cups per hour.
   - Each cup was sold for $0.50.
   - Earnings per hour = 15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour.
   - Total earnings for 4 hours = $7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30.

2. For the next two hours:
   - Patrick sold 10 cups per hour.
   - Each cup was sold for $0.60.
   - Earnings per hour = 10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6.00/hour.
   - Total earnings for 2 hours = $6.00/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Adding the earnings from both periods:
- Total earnings = $30 + $12 = $42.

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours."
"To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - For every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 400 miles, the number of rotations is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/rotation cycle}} \times 725 \text{ rotations/cycle} = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \text{ rotations/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of rotations per year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of rotations per year is:
     \[
     145,000 \text{ rotations/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations/year}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of years before the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.
   - The number of years before the tire needs to be replaced is:
     \[

"The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washings when using 2 pumps per wash. If Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, we need to determine the cost per pump in cents.

First, calculate the number of washings per pump:
\[ \text{Washings per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump} \]

Next, calculate the cost per washing:
\[ \text{Cost per washing} = \frac{24 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washings}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} \]

Then, calculate the cost per pump:
\[ \text{Cost per pump} = 60 \text{ washings} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars per washing} = 12 \text{ dollars per pump} \]

Finally, convert the cost per pump to cents:
\[ \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 12 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 1200 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the cost per pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Given the scenario, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Initial Budget**: Joe has $50.
2. **Discounted Price of Shirt**: The shirt originally costs $25 with a 30% discount.
   - Discount amount: \(25 \times 0.30 = 7.50\)
   - Discounted price: \(25 - 7.50 = 17.50\)

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to calculate the maximum number of missed classes based on the total cost and the number of classes.

Given:
- Total cost for Karate classes: $60
- Total number of classes: 10

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum \( x \) such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

Solving the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we start by understanding their daily customer processing rates. Given that Jewel processes 50 customers daily and Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers daily.

Next, we calculate the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day. This is \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers.

Since they work all days of the week, we need to find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly production is \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is:

"To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of heads is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

We can write the following equations based on the given information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

To simplify the second equation, we can divide everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ \begin{cases} 
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35 
\end{cases} \]

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money each person has and then find out how much they would each have if they shared the total amount equally.

First, let's establish the amount of money Aurelia has:
- Aurelia has $120.

Next, we calculate the amount of money Kassidy has. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Aurelia has:
- Kassidy's money = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\) dollars.

Then, we determine the amount of money Rayna has. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy:
- Rayna's money = \(90 + 60 = 150\) dollars.

Now, we add up the total amount of money:
- Total money = Aurelia's money + Kassidy's money + Rayna's money = \(120 + 90 + 150 = 360\) dollars.

Finally, we divide the total amount of money equally among the three individuals:
- Each person's share = \(\frac{360}{3} = 120\) dollars.

\[ \text{Number of management employees} = 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. Since 30% of the management employees oversee the company, we calculate this as:

\[ \text{Number of employees who oversee the company} = 30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of employees who oversee the company is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins, we need to calculate the sum of the flour, sugar, and salt required for each muffin and then multiply by 16.

For flour:
- Each muffin requires 5 tablespoons.

"To determine how much change Adam received, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies he bought and then subtract that from the amount he paid.

First, let's calculate the cost of the candies:
- Adam bought 7 candies of type A, each costing $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
  \[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars} \]

- Adam also bought 10 candies of type B, each costing $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
  \[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam paid $15, so the change he received is:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the change Adam got is:

"Given the information, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Christina recorded her mood over 30 days.
2. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
3. Her first 8 days were good.
4. Her next 8 days were bad.
5. Her following 8 days were neutral.
6. The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
- Total days = 30
- Good days = 12
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = Total days - (Good days + Bad days) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

Next, we account for the specific days mentioned:
- First 8 days were good, so 8 good days are already accounted for.
- The next 3 days are specified as good, neutral, and good, which means 2 more good days.

So, the total number of good days is:
- Initial good days (first 8 days) = 8
- Additional good days (next 3 days) = 2
- Total good days = 8 + 2 = 10

Since the total number of good days recorded is 12, and we have already accounted for 10 good days, the number of good days left in the month is:
12 - 10 = 2

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\(\boxed{2}\)"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find the value of \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

"To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches.
2. Calculate the additional height needed.
3. Determine the number of days required for the bamboo to grow the additional height.

First, convert the current height of 20 feet to inches:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Next, calculate the additional height needed to reach 600 inches:
\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. To find the number of days required to grow 360 inches, divide the additional height by the daily growth rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches.

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's sum up the total number of cookies:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the original length of the dress before any extensions or additions were made. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

According to the problem, Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and then adds an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm. We can express this relationship with the following equation:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was \( 80 \) cm.

The final answer is:

"To determine how long it took Chris to mow his lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes, we need to calculate the time for each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

First, let's establish the mowing rates:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 60 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris mows the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so his rate is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Adding these times together gives the total time:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that four candies cost $3.20. Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
So, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:

"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have saved over ten years, we need to calculate their monthly savings and then multiply by the total number of months in ten years.

Rong saves 20 coins per month. Over ten years (120 months), Rong's total savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong each month. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:
\[ 20 \text{ coins} + \left(20 \text{ coins} \times \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 \text{ coins} + 8 \text{ coins} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \]

Over ten years (120 months), Neil's total savings are:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding Rong's and Neil's total savings together, we get:

"To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, let's break down the information given:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, which means Gordy's truck can haul \(4000 + 800 = 4800\) pounds.
3. The combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds.

Let \(x\) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. The equation for the combined capacity is:

\[4000 + 4800 + x = 11600\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[8800 + x = 11600\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 8800 from both sides:

\[x = 11600 - 8800\]
\[x = 2800\]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we need to calculate the dumplings consumed by both males and females and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of dumplings each group ate:**
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

2. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:**
   - There are 6 females, and each ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

3. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:**
   - There are 8 males, and each ate 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

4. **Calculate the total number of dumplings cooked:**
   - Total dumplings = dumplings eaten by females + dumplings eaten by males.
   - Total dumplings = \(18 + 32 = 50\).

Therefore, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald received and then account for the amount he spent.

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Turtle's speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds."
"The local firefighters are conducting a ""fill the boot"" fundraiser with a goal of raising $6300. After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100. To determine how many more hours they need to fundraise, we first calculate the remaining amount needed:

\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Next, we find the hourly rate of fundraising by dividing the amount raised in the first 3 hours by 3:

\[ \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

This means they raise $700 per hour. To find out how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the hourly rate:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding these 6 hours to the initial 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to fundraise is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they need to fundraise to reach their goal is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the industrial usage percentage:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Therefore, the industrial usage is \(40\% \times 80\% = 32\%\).

2. **Calculate the non-industrial usage percentage:**
   - The total usage by the city is 40%.
   - Subtract the industrial usage from the total usage to find the non-industrial usage.
   - Non-industrial usage = \(40\% - 32\% = 8\%\).

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes is \(\boxed{8\%}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages.

First, we know that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages. The dog, on the other hand, can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

First, convert the length of one of Topher's shoes into inches. Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]
Adding the 4 inches, we get:
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Then, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second house will need \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the first house, which is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
- The third house will need double the first house, which is \( 2x \).

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{4x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 250 \]
\[ 7x = 500 \]
\[ x = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \]

The third house needs \( 2x \) cases of shingles. Substituting \( x = \frac{500}{7} \) into this expression, we get:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{500}{7} = \frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.86 \]

Since the problem asks for the exact number of cases, the third house will need \(\boxed{142.86}\) cases of shingles."

"In the given scenario, we are provided with the information that in one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. It is also mentioned that Ezra has read 300 books in one hour and decided to read 150 more. 

First, we calculate the total number of books Ezra will have read:
\[300 + 150 = 450\]

Next, since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, we determine the number of books Ahmed read:
\[\frac{300}{2} = 150\]

To find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we add the number of books each has read:
\[450 + 150 = 600\]

Therefore, the total number of books they have read altogether is:
\[600\]"

"The problem presented involves calculating the difference in scores between Ava and Emma based on the points they earn from enemies, berries, and time. Let's break down the information and calculate the difference in their scores.

Given:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Points are awarded as follows:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on.
- 5 points for each berry collected.
- 30 points for each second left on the timer when the level is finished.

Let's denote:
- \( E_e \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( E_b \) as the number of berries Emma collects.
- \( E_t \) as the seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

Then, for Ava:
- \( A_e = E_e + 8 \)
- \( A_b = E_b + 3 \)
- \( A_t = E_t + 4 \)

The total score for Emma is:
\[ \text{Score}_E = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t \]

The total score for Ava is:
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10A_e + 5A_b + 30A_t \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10(E_e + 8) + 5(E_b + 3) + 30(E_t + 4) \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 80 + 5E_b + 15 + 30E_t + 120 \]
\[ \text{Score}_A = 10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215 \]

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E \]
\[ \text{Difference} = (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t + 215) - (10E_e + 5E_b + 30E_t) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 215 \]

Therefore, the difference between their two scores is:

\[ 34 \div 2 = 17 \]

Thus, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which amounts to:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the times they do on the usual days, so they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
for 2 days, which amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding the rides from both sets of days together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought from the pet store. Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish as \(W\).

Initially, Bob had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying more fish, he had:
- \(3 + O\) orange fish
- \(4 + W\) white fish

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[3 + O = 2(4 + W)\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \(O\) and \(W\):
\[O - 2W = 5\]

We also know that the total number of fish Bob bought is 17:
\[O + W = 17\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(O - 2W = 5\)
2. \(O + W = 17\)

We can solve this system by substitution. From the second equation, we can express \(O\) in terms of \(W\):
\[O = 17 - W\]

Substitute this expression for \(O\) into the first equation:
\[17 - W - 2W = 5\]

Combine like terms:
\[17 - 3W = 5\]

Subtract 17 from both sides:
\[-3W = 5 - 17\]

\[-3W = -12\]

Divide both sides by -3:
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To verify, we check the condition that after adding the new fish, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish:
\[3 + 13 = 16\]
\[4 + 4 = 8\]

Since \(16 = 2 \times 8\), the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
\[\boxed{4}\]"

"To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of her total stuffed animals, we start by calculating the current total number of stuffed animals she has:

- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy. After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

"Kris is aiming to earn a video game achievement by playing a total of 30 hours. She plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks and then for 2 hours every day for a week. To determine how many more hours she needs to play, we can break down her playing schedule:

1. For the first 2 weeks, she plays half an hour each day. There are 14 days in 2 weeks, so:
   \[
   14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For the next week, she plays 2 hours each day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. Adding the hours from both parts of her schedule:
   \[
   7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. To find out how many more hours she needs to play to reach 30 hours, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:
   \[
   30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will cover:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will cover:
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 70 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. The difference in distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_2 - \text{Distance}_1 = 140 \, \text{miles} - 120 \, \text{miles} = 20 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final answer is:

"To determine the length of the mosaic Milo can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has.
2. Determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with the total number of glass chips.
3. Determine the length of the mosaic given its height.

First, let's find out how many glass chips Milo has in total. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:
\[ 72 \times 2 = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, the number of square inches Milo can make is:
\[ \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

"The problem involves calculating the initial amount of tea in gallons based on the consumption and remaining quantities.

First, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total tea consumed:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

Given that there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

To convert quarts to gallons, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ gallon} = 4 \text{ quarts}\):
\[ \frac{48 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ quarts/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - She drops 1 flower of each type, so she loses:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.

"The problem presented involves basic arithmetic and distribution of resources. Here's the refined solution:

John and DeSean started with 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean made 9 S'mores, using a total of:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows lost is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Subtracting the lost marshmallows from the initial amount gives:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows can be used to make 14 S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these S'mores equally, each can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money used by Jack and his friends at the arcade. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

The amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.

- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:

\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

"Boris owns a chocolate factory and produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. The production for each week is as follows:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

To find the production for the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production:

Total production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Total monthly production:
\[ 50,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{14,000}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross a highway, given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to do so.

First, let's establish the distance \(D\) that the kangaroos travel. If three kangaroos, each traveling at speed \(v\), take 18 hours to cross the highway, the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cross the same distance. Each turtle travels at a speed of \(\frac{v}{2}\). The combined speed of the four turtles is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for the four turtles to cross the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{2v} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for four turtles to cross the highway is:

"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the unused portion of each glue stick and then sum these portions.

1. For the first glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]
   Since the original length of each glue stick is 12 millimeters, the unused length of the first glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:

"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help. To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10,000 + \$800 = \$10,800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5,000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5,000 + \$200 = \$5,200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10,800 - \$5,200 = \$5,600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs \(\$5,600\)."

"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

"Let's define the variables for the ages:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:

- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"The problem involves determining how much soup is left for the children after the family has eaten their bowls. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of soup available:**
   - The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
   - Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the soup consumed by the family:**
   - Calvin and his wife are adults, and they each have one bowl.
   - The two children each have one bowl.
   - Total bowls consumed = 2 (adults) + 2 (children) = 4 bowls.

3. **Determine the leftover soup:**
   - Since the total amount of soup is 4 adult bowls and the family has consumed 4 bowls, there is no soup left for the children to have additional bowls for lunch.

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then calculate his age in 8 years.

Let's denote:
- Duncan's current age as \( D \).
- Adam's current age as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \), and four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).

The relationship given is:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.**

Given that there are 30 students and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**

The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.**

The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine Peter's age based on the provided conditions. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( P \) for Peter's age
- \( Pa \) for Paul's age
- \( J \) for Jean's age

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify and combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month and then convert that into revenue.

1. **Calculate the number of widgets produced by each machine in a month:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 60
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Widgets per hour: 45
     - Hours per day: 24
     - Days per month: 30
     - Total widgets per month = 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets

2. **Calculate the revenue generated by each machine:**

   - **Widgeteer 3000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

   - **WidgetMaster 9000:**
     - Price per widget: $6
     - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

3. **Find the difference in revenue between the two machines:**

   - Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
   - Difference in revenue = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

Therefore, Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000."
"To determine how much money Cameron would save, let's break down the costs step by step.

First, calculate the total time Cameron will stay at the hotel. He arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours. For the additional hours, the cost is 70 pesos per hour. Cameron stays for 5 additional hours (17 hours - 12 hours).

The cost for the additional 5 hours is:
\[ 5 \times 70 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

So, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:
\[ 1000 + 350 = 1350 \text{ pesos} \]

If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, the cost would be 1600 pesos.

The amount of money Cameron would save by choosing the 12-hour plus additional hours option is:
\[ 1600 - 1350 = 250 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we first need to calculate the hay requirement for each type of animal and then sum these amounts.

Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep requires:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]
With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives us the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:
\[ \boxed{159} \]"
"John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

He then deposits $100 in the bank, leaving him with:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

He buys 5 pencils at $10 each, spending:
\[ 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from his remaining money, he has:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

With the remaining $100, he can buy:

"Given the problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

From the second equation, we can express \( A \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substituting these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, substituting \( B = 25 \) back into the expression for \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."

1. Calculate the total number of pages that 1.5 inches of paper can accommodate:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we divide the total number of pages by 2:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we first calculate the total time he spent stapling. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, we find the number of 15-minute intervals in 900 minutes:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since he staples 30 reports in each interval, the total number of reports stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to the problem, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"The problem can be approached by defining variables and setting up equations based on the given relationships.

Let \( J \) represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried. According to the problem:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls, so:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:

"The problem involves calculating the number of holes dug by a pirate crew on the fourth day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes, but 2 were filled in, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes

   Therefore, the total number of holes by the end of the third day is:
   \[
   10 + 13 + 6 = 29
   \]

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day:**
   - At the end of the first day, they had 10 holes.

3. **Calculate the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:**
   - By the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40
   \]

4. **Find the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   - The number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
   \[
   40 - 29 = 11
   \]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon.
Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"To determine how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the length of each episode: 20 minutes.

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three segments, each with a specific direction and speed. To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the net distance traveled in the southward direction.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Leg:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

Next, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

The net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"To determine the number of brownies Greta had left over, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

First, we calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

Therefore, the number of brownies Greta had left over is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, making his brother 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age, so she is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old. The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of string and then sum these times.

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Adding these times together:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to restring all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. Each phone after the first 2 is half price. The price of each phone is $600.

The cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"To determine the total number of players in both teams combined, we start by identifying the number of players on each team. Given that Carlton's team has 13 players and Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, we can calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, we add the number of players on both teams to find the total number of players:

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is:

\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, totaling 4 boxes given away. This leaves her with 8 boxes. She then kept 1/4 of the remaining 8 boxes for herself, which is 2 boxes. Therefore, she sold the rest, which is 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges.

The correct answer is: \(\boxed{120}\)"
"The United States of America has 50 states. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \). Adding 4 to this gives the number of states in India as \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25 is:

Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. We know the total number of cherries is 60, and Robert has 30 cherries. Additionally, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so Richard has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ cherries} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cherries Jerry has by subtracting the cherries that Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries:

\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ cherries} \]

Now, we find the difference between the number of cherries Robert has and the number of cherries Jerry has:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:

"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day.
2. Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over the 8 days.
3. Determine how many 8-ounce bottles are required.

First, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used per day:
- Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.
- She is outside for 4 hours a day.
- Therefore, she uses \(1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}\).

Next, we calculate the total amount of sunscreen used over 8 days:
- She uses 4 ounces per day.
- Over 8 days, she will use \(4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}\).

Now, we determine how many 8-ounce bottles are needed to provide 32 ounces of sunscreen:
- Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
- Therefore, the number of bottles needed is \(\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}\).

So, Pamela will need to pack \(\boxed{4}\) bottles of sunscreen."
"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

"Given the information:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be 48 years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be 12 years old.

To find the current ages of Emil's dad and brother:

- Emil's dad will be 48 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 years old in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days and then determine how many servings he has based on the given serving size.

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
   \[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]
3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch:
   \[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we sum the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, we calculate the number of servings by dividing the total pounds by 3:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the number of students leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players in Mr. Roper's class. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players, we perform the following calculation:

\[ 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Next, we subtract the number of football players from the total number of students to find the remaining students:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as follows:

\[ 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Finally, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

"To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we need to calculate the total cost of the plants she plans to use. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the total number of petunias needed:**
   - Each basket requires 3 petunias.
   - Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - Total petunias = \(3 \text{ petunias/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 15 \text{ petunias}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of sweet potato vines needed:**
   - Each basket requires 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Katherine has 5 baskets.
   - Total sweet potato vines = \(2 \text{ vines/basket} \times 5 \text{ baskets} = 10 \text{ vines}\).

3. **Determine the cost of the petunias:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = \(15 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00/\text{petunia} = \$45.00\).

"Given the scenario, we need to determine how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil after accounting for the sunflowers and carnations.

First, calculate the soil used for the sunflowers:
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
- They plant 4 sunflowers, so the total soil used for sunflowers is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds.

Next, calculate the soil used for the carnations:
- Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They plant 10 carnations, so the total soil used for carnations is \(10 \times 1.5 = 15\) pounds.

Now, add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[12 + 15 = 27\] pounds.

Subtract the total soil used from the initial amount of soil to find the remaining soil:
\[30 - 27 = 3\] pounds.

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is:
\[3 \div 1 = 3\].

Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
2. Determine the total amount she can spend on shoes in a year.
3. Calculate how many pairs of shoes she can buy with that total amount.

First, Jessica sets aside 25% of her $2,000.00 monthly paycheck for shoes:
\[ 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]
So, she sets aside $500.00 each month.

Next, we calculate the total amount she can spend on shoes in a year:
\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]
Thus, she can spend $6,000.00 on shoes in a year.

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautÃ©ing processes separately and then combine the times.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **SautÃ©ing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sautÃ© 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sautÃ© 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sautÃ© 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be completed sequentially, the total time is the sum of the peeling and sautering times:

2. **Determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.
   - Therefore, Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

3. **Determine the time interval between the two sightings:**
   - Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the time interval between the two sightings is 75 years.

4. **Calculate Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time, and the interval between the two sightings is 75 years, then he was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

Therefore, Bill was \(\boxed{15}\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to consider the frequency of each type of check he writes.

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill. Similarly, this amounts to:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: Buford writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this totals:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}

"The problem can be broken down as follows:

1. Let \( F \) represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day.
2. The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, so the number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
3. The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F / 2 = \frac{1}{8}F \).
4. The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, \( F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \).

Now, we need to find the number of flights to France, which is \( \frac{1}{8}F \):
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the howls of Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous in minutes.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's find the total duration of their howls combined:
\[20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}\]

To convert the total duration from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
\[120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine the age of Wilfred among four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know the following:

1. Akbar is 3 years old.
2. Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. The total age of the children is 20.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

Let's denote the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred as \(A\), \(B\), \(H\), and \(W\) respectively.

From the information provided:
\[ A = 3 \]
\[ B = 4 \]
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

First, substitute the known values of \(A\) and \(B\) into the total age equation:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, substitute the known values of \(A\), \(B\), and the total age into the equation for Helene's age:
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{3 + 4 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{7 + H + W}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{7 + 13}{4} \] (since \(H + W = 13\))
\[ H = 2 \times \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ H = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ H = 10 \]

Now that we know Helene's age \(H = 10\), we can find Wilfred's age \(W\) using the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times the amount collected from these sources. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ 3 \times 2000 = 6000 \]

Walter's friend is going to donate an additional $200, but this does not affect the lawyer's contribution, which is based on the initial total of $2000.

Thus, the lawyer's contribution is:

\[ \boxed{6000} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies brought to the reception:**
   - There are 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(100 \times 15 = 1500\).

2. **Determine the number of cookies given to the church:**
   - The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church.
   - So, the number of cookies given to the church is \(\frac{1500}{2} = 750\).

3. **Calculate the number of people in the church:**
   - Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
   - Therefore, the number of people in the church is \(\frac{750}{15} = 50\).

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"In this scenario, we have a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) dividing a watermelon. Each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

The total number of slices is \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon."
"Doctor Jones has a total of 9 hours scheduled at the clinic on Monday. He spends 20 minutes per inpatient on rounds and has 10 appointments, each lasting 30 minutes. With 9 inpatients, the total time spent on rounds is:

\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes/inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 180 minutes to hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

The total time spent on appointments is:

\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes/appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 300 minutes to hours:

\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on rounds and appointments:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Subtracting this from the total 9 hours at the clinic:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost based on the price per gallon.

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
\[ 25 \times 14 = 350 \]

Next, multiply the result by 4:
\[ 350 \times 4 = 1400 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 1400 cubic feet.

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons:
\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \]

So, the pool needs 8260 gallons of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**

The cost is $0.10 per gallon:
\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is:
\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, let's analyze the given information step by step:

   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the first day} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much as Wanda:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the first day} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Total water pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Total water pumped on the first day} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water pumped on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( x \).

For the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = x \times (0.91)^5 \]

For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after these 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."

"Jamaar has $10 to spend on fresh fruits. The costs are as follows: peaches and pears are $0.50 each, apples are $0.75 each, kiwis are $1 each, and plums are $0.25 each. He has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.5 = 1.5\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1 = 2.0\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost so far:
\[1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Subtracting this from the $10 he started with, we find the remaining amount:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

Since each plum costs $0.25, the number of plums he can buy is:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, further reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal.
   - Let \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

2. **Establish Relationships:**
   - According to the problem, \( L = 3S \).
   - Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4, we have \( S = 4 \).
   - Therefore, \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = (2x \times S) + (x \times L)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     120 = 8x + 12x
     \]
     \[
     120 = 20x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
     \]

4. **Determine the Number of Small Stuffed Animals Sold:**
   - Since \( x \) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals."

First, calculate the earnings from the cookies:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, calculate the earnings from the cupcakes:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Now, add the earnings from both the cookies and cupcakes to get the total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total earnings to find out how much money she has left:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

\[40 - 10 = 30\]

The number of eggs found by the friends is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the daily ore mining capacity of a dwarf with a steel pickaxe and then scale it up to 40 dwarves over 30 days.

1. **Determine the ore mining capacity with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the capacity doubles: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the capacity is 50% more than with an iron pickaxe: \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**
   - Each dwarf can mine 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total ore mined is \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{43200}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to establish the price per sandwich for each package and ensure the prices are proportional.

First, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first package:
- Number of sandwiches: 2
- Price: $3
- Price per sandwich: \(\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\) dollars

Next, let's calculate the price per sandwich for the second package:
- Number of sandwiches: 4
- Price: $6
- Price per sandwich: \(\frac{6}{4} = 1.5\) dollars

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistent at $1.50.

Now, we can find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
- Number of sandwiches: 8
- Price per sandwich: $1.50
- Total cost: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\) dollars

Therefore, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"The probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow can be calculated by determining the scenarios where he does not get an extension and then subtracting this from 100%.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework:**
   - 50% or 0.50

2. **Probability of the normal teacher coming in and giving everyone an extension:**
   - 40% or 0.40

3. **Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension but Marcus still getting a personal extension:**
   - Probability of the normal teacher not giving an extension = 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension = 20% or 0.20
   - Combined probability = 0.60 * 0.20 = 0.12

Summing these probabilities gives the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:
\[ 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.12 = 0.102 \]

The probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 1 - 0.102 = 0.898 \]

"To determine the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required and then multiply by the cost per tile.

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"James's insurance cost after the accident is 60% more than the normal cost of $120 per month. To find the increased monthly cost, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives us the new monthly insurance cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

To find the annual cost, we multiply the new monthly cost by 12:

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the total amount James pays a year is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets used and then figure out how many loads are required based on the machine's capacity.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of movies watched on Saturday:
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = 6 \(\times\) 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{24}\)."

2. Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
3. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as last year, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers.

Now, we sum the stickers from all three years:
\[ 100 \text{ (two years ago)} + 50 \text{ (last year)} + 100 \text{ (this year)} = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers in Leo's collection is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to calculate the daily consumption and then divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption.

Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day, so each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

With 3 cats, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Given that Imma has 720 grams of cat food, the number of days this will last is:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Slices of Pizza**: There are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

2. **Slices Eaten by Each Person**:
   - Let \(J\) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \(J + 3\) slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2J\) slices.
   - We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so \(J + 3 = 10\). Solving for \(J\), we get \(J = 7\).

3. **Calculating Slices for Each Person**:
   - Jake ate \(J = 7\) slices.
   - Becky ate \(J + 3 = 10\) slices.
   - Silvia ate \(2J = 14\) slices.

4. **Total Slices Eaten**:
   - Adding the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia: \(10 + 7 + 14 = 31\).

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( D \) be the time Donovan's part took in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."
"To determine the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each charge and sum them up:

1. **Cast**: $200
2. **Doctor's visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the charge is:
   \[
   300 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Painkillers**: $4 per pill for 30 pills:
   \[
   4 \text{ dollars/pill} \times 30 \text{ pills} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Parking**: $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours:
   \[
   6 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ dollars}

"James receives 80 emails per day. Out of these, 20% do not require any response. To find the number of emails that do not need a response, we calculate:

\[ 80 \times 0.20 = 16 \text{ emails} \]

Therefore, the number of emails that require a response is:

\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

Since James works 5 days a week, the total number of emails he responds to in a week is:

\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \text{ emails} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"The Science Center hosted field trips from Monday through Friday last week. The number of classes visiting each day is as follows:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we sum the number of classes for each day:

\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192

   \]

3. Divide the total score by the number of tests (4) to find the average:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we calculate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the glee club's order is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]
So, the number of pizzas left from the football team's order is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas} \]

Adding the remaining pizzas from both the glee club and the football team gives us the total number of pizzas left:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final number of pizzas left is:

"To determine the total cost of postage Anthony spends, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of big coupons: Since Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he is sending out 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
   \[
   2 \times 700 = 1400
   \]

2. Calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons: Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, so the total cost for the small coupons is:
   \[
   700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. Calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons: Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, so the total cost for the big coupons is:
   \[
   1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\(\boxed{24}\)"
"Mr. Hezekiah initially dispatched 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. This means the total amount of fertiliser dispatched was:

\[ 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons} \]

Two hours into the delivery, it was reported that a quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures. Therefore, the number of trucks with mechanical failures is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks} \]

This leaves:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks} \]

These 15 trucks successfully delivered their load. Thus, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons} \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the cost of the butter Dennis needs, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, Dennis gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 1.5 pounds of butter is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

4. **Determine how many sets of 1.5 pounds are in 6 pounds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1.5 \text{ pounds/set}} = 4 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 6 pounds of butter:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \text{ sets} \times \$6.00 \text{ per set} = \$24.00
   \]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[

"To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who could not come to find the actual number of guests attending.
3. Calculate the cost based on the theater rental fee and the additional guest fee.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests, and $6 for each additional guest. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's determine how much money Maggie originally had. Maggie spent a quarter of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is three-quarters of her original amount. Let's denote Maggie's original amount of money as \( M \). We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4}M = 60 \]
To find \( M \), we solve for \( M \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ M = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80 \]
So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter of it, she has $60 left.

Next, let's determine how much money Riza originally had. Riza spent one-third of her money and has $60 left. This means that the $60 is two-thirds of her original amount. Let's denote Riza's original amount of money as \( R \). We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3}R = 60 \]
To find \( R \), we solve for \( R \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[ R = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90 \]
So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third of it, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:
\[ 60 + 60 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we need to first calculate the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week and then find out how many are left for the third monkey.

1. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. Therefore, in a week (7 days), the first monkey eats:
   \[
   10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ bananas}
   \]

2. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas each day}
   \]
   Therefore, in a week, the second monkey eats:
   \[
   14 \times 7 = 98 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is:
   \[
   70 + 98 = 168 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas to feed the three monkeys for a week, the number of bananas left for the third monkey is:
   \[
   315 - 168 = 147 \text{ bananas}
   \]

5. Since the third monkey eats these 147 bananas over 7 days, the number of bananas the third monkey eats each day is:
   \[
   \frac{147}{7} = 21 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy completed half of a 500-piece puzzle, which amounts to 250 pieces. He then finished another 500-piece puzzle, completing all 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:

The correct answer is: 750 pieces."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many quarters Jenny will receive as change after purchasing 15 roses from the florist.

First, let's calculate the cost of 15 roses. The cost of a dozen roses is $15, and since a dozen is 12, the cost per rose is:

\[ \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per rose} \]

Therefore, the cost of 15 roses is:

\[ 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \text{ quarters} \]

Thus, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"

"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved, we calculate:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture. Therefore, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."
"To determine the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price of the watch, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for, which is 75% of the original price.
2. Calculate the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for, which is 120% of the price he bought it for.
3. Determine the discount amount from the original price.
4. Calculate the percentage discount.

Let's go through these steps:

1. The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price:
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers bought the watch for} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]

2. Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for:
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]

3. The discount amount from the original price is:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]

4. The percentage discount is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours, given that each spring creates one jellyfish every second.

1. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.
   - For 4 hours, the total number of seconds is \(4 \times 3600 = 14400\) seconds.

2. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours:**
   - Since one spring creates 1 jellyfish per second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will create 14400 jellyfish.

3. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours:**
   - If one spring creates 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will create \(5 \times 14400 = 72000\) jellyfish.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"Frankie's score was 15 more than twice Binkie's score. Given that Binkie's score was 90, we can calculate Frankie's score as follows:

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of the bananas in both scenarios and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas:
\[ \text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost if Jenny were to buy these bananas individually at $0.80 per banana:
\[ \text{Total cost for individual bananas} = 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for buying the bananas in bunches at $3.00 per bunch:
\[ \text{Total cost for bunches} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, we find the amount of money saved by subtracting the total cost for bunches from the total cost for individual bananas:
\[ \text{Money saved} = \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the amount of fence Sam gets. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is **12**."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends learning in a week, we need to calculate the time spent in classes and the additional learning time on the weekend.

First, calculate the time spent in classes during the weekdays:
- John has 8 classes (6 normal periods + 2 extra classes).
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, calculate the additional learning time on the weekend:
- He spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekday class time on each of Saturday and Sunday.
\[ \frac{1}{16} \times 320 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]
- Since he spends this time on both Saturday and Sunday:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add the weekday class time and the weekend extra learning time to get the total weekly learning time:
\[ 320 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert the total weekly learning time from minutes to hours:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends 6 hours a week learning."

\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height with each bounce. So, the height after the first bounce is:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Then, the ball bounces again to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height it reached after the first bounce. So, the height after the second bounce is:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"The first child is 6 feet tall, which converts to 72 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches).

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so the second child's height is:
\[72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}\]

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child's height is:
\[74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}\]

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child's height is:
\[69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}\]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches."

Therefore, the orchard earned \(\boxed{1000}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the final amount of meat consumed by the Allosaurus.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. This means that before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left.
2. The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left before the Allosaurus ate. Therefore, the 270 kilograms represent the other half of what was left after the T-Rex ate. This means that before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \(270 \times 2 = 540\) kilograms of meat.
3. The T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, leaving 540 kilograms. Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \(540 \times 2 = 1080\) kilograms.

Thus, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was \(\boxed{1080}\) kilograms."

"The problem involves determining the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can. Let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. Initially, there are 12 sodas in total, with 3 of them shaken and 9 unshaken.
2. Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 2 unshaken and 3 shaken sodas.
3. Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 2 shaken and 6 unshaken sodas.

Now, we need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda from the remaining 8 sodas. The number of shaken sodas left is 2, and the total number of sodas left is 8.

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

"To determine how many people Billy helps, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy works, considering he takes 20% of the days off.
3. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps based on his working hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- From March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time spent by Amalia, Megan, and Dior on their respective chores.

1. Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.
2. Megan spent 2 hours longer than Amalia walking the dog, so Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior spent more than 4 hours longer than Amalia doing laundry, so Dior spent at least \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" means at least 5 hours, but we can use 9 as a clear example of ""well over"").

Now, we add up the time spent by each person:
\[4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19\]

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine the total miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate the one-way distance:**
   - John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph.
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - Distance = 70 mph Ã— 2 hours = 140 miles (one way)

2. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   - Round trip distance = 2 Ã— One-way distance
   - Round trip distance = 2 Ã— 140 miles = 280 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance for all visits in a month:**
   - John visits his parents twice a month.
   - Total distance = Number of visits Ã— Round trip distance
   - Total distance = 2 Ã— 280 miles = 560 miles

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:
560 miles"
"Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, the total distance she will walk is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, the distance Brian will walk is:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Brian will walk in seven days is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers over 10 hours:**
   - Since they work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

3. **Determine the total production needed:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce 400 toys in total and still needs 20 more toys after the first four workers have completed their work. This means the total production of all five workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

4. **Calculate the production of the fifth worker:**
   - Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys.

5. **Determine the hourly production rate of the fifth worker:**
   - The fifth worker worked for 10 hours, so the hourly production rate is \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

Therefore, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs. We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. 

1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Koryâ€™s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Koryâ€™s dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Koryâ€™s dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's work through it step by step, starting from the end and moving backward.

1. **Kris's Stickers:**
   - Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob.
   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Luis's Stickers:**
   - Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris.
   - Since Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half.
   - Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Seth's Stickers:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Since Luis originally had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Thus, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

\[

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance, given his daily flying distance.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of the circumference is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flying distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and use the given information to set up equations.

Let:
- \( A \) be the number of eggs Arnold painted.
- \( M \) be the number of eggs Madeline painted.
- \( C \) be the number of eggs Camden painted.
- \( S \) be the number of eggs Sarah painted.

From the problem, we have:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).

First, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, find \( C \):
\[ C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Next, use the total number of eggs painted:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \):
\[ A + A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Finally, find how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds.

First, let's calculate the number of groups of 8 crayons Nik can make from 200 crayons:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]

Since each group of crayons will be placed in a box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ \text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the boxes:
\[ \text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of them. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 of them is:

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

Thus, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over this period.

For the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs per day:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs per day:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total number of eggs for 60 days:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"To determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the probability of winning for each ticket.
2. Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners.

Given:
- The probability of winning for the first ticket, \( P_1 \), is 20%, or 0.20.
- The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so the probability of winning for the second ticket, \( P_2 \), is \( 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \).

The probability that both tickets are winners is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{both tickets are winners}) = P_1 \times P_2 = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is \(\boxed{12\%}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's define the lengths of the ropes using variables and then use the given relationships to form equations.

Let:
- \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]

Next, substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the third equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now, find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
2. Determine the cost per pod in the special size box.
3. Calculate the number of cycles that can be run for $1.

First, the special size box contains 20% more pods than the regular box. The regular box has 100 pods, so the special size box has:

\[ 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. Therefore, the cost per pod is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:

   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20

- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
- Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"The problem presented involves determining how many days a teacher can use a piece of chalk before it needs to be recycled, given the constraints on chalk usage and the initial length of the chalk.

1. **Initial Chalk Length and Usage on Monday:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - Remaining chalk after Monday: \(5 - (5 \times 0.45) = 5 - 2.25 = 2.75\) inches.

2. **Daily Usage and Recycle Point:**
   - The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - We need to find out how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

Let's calculate the remaining chalk after each day:

- **Day 1:**
  \[
  2.75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 2:**
  \[
  2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 3:**
  \[
  1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 4:**
  \[
  1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Day 5:**
  \[
  1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}

Thrice the number of face masks Mike bought is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Adding 2 more to that gives \(15 + 2 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of face masks Johnny bought is 17.

**Answer:** 17"
"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of teeth the dentist drills.
2. Calculate the number of teeth the dentist caps.
3. Determine the total number of teeth fixed.
4. Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed out of the total number of teeth.

The dentist drills 4 teeth. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means the dentist caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth. The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

The percentage of teeth fixed is calculated by dividing the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and then multiplying by 100. The total number of teeth is 30. So, the percentage is:
\[
\left(\frac{15}{30}\right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine the refund amount, we first calculate the total cost of the milk purchased by Mr. Marcellus:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we calculate the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is based on the cost of the sour milk:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

Therefore, the correct refund amount is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and translate the given information into equations.

Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can express these statements as equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices required for her 6 friends and then convert those slices into whole pizza pies.

Each friend eats:
- 6 slices of cheese pizza
- 4 slices of pepperoni pizza

For 6 friends, the total number of slices is:
- Cheese pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices}\)
- Pepperoni pizza slices: \(6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices}\)

Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so the number of cheese pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizza pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizza pies} = 6 \text{ pizza pies} \]

Final answer: \(\boxed{6}\)"

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 sets of 15 minutes.
   - In 15 minutes, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every 15 minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.

3. **Convert Time to Hours:**
   - 300 minutes is equivalent to \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

"To determine Jim's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many years ago Digimon came out. Since it is celebrating its 20th anniversary, it came out 20 years ago.
2. Calculate John's age 20 years ago. John is currently 28 years old, so 20 years ago, he was \(28 - 20 = 8\) years old.
3. According to the problem, when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. Therefore, Jim was \(8 / 2 = 4\) years old at that time.
4. To find Jim's current age, add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to Jim's age at that time. So, Jim is now \(4 + 20 = 24\) years old.

Therefore, Jim is now 24 years old."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the bandages used and ordered each day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is: \(12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\)

The correct answer is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the total cost of May's hair cut and color, we need to break down the expenses:

1. The cost of the color is a flat rate of $40.
2. The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch of hair cut off. Since her hair was cut from 10 inches to 8 inches, she had 2 inches cut off. Therefore, the cost for the haircut is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Jen works in April.
2. Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.
3. Add the additional amount for complete attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days Jen works in April.**
Since April has exactly 4 weeks and Jen works 6 days a week, the total number of days she works in April is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days} \]

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings based on her hourly rate.**
Jen's hourly rate is $1.5, and she works 7.5 hours a day. Therefore, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} \]
For 24 days, her total earnings are:
\[ 24 \text{ days} \times 11.25 \text{ dollars/day} = 270 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Add the additional amount for complete attendance.**
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she receives an additional $10 for complete attendance. Therefore, her total earnings for April are:

"To determine the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items John buys, which includes both scotch and cognac.

First, let's determine the cost per bottle of scotch. John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Therefore, the cost per bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of cognac John buys. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:
\[ 60 + 0.5 \times 60 = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the cognac. Since John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each, the total cost for the cognac is:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount John spends on everything is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"

\[ x = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of fish with red stripes. Given that one-third of the 66 fish have red stripes:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes. Next, we calculate the number of fish remaining after removing those with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

From the remaining 44 fish, \( \frac{5}{11} \) have blue stripes:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Thus, 20 fish have blue stripes. Adding the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes gives:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red stripes or blue stripes is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Eyeshadow Colors:**
   - Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
   - She also had three makeup sets with six colors each: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially had is \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors.

2. **After Her Sister Steals One Palette:**
   - One palette with 4 colors is stolen, so the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors.

3. **Amy Uses Up Half of the Colors from One Makeup Set:**
   - One makeup set has 6 colors, and she uses up half of them, which is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors.
   - Therefore, the number of colors left from that set is \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors.
   - The total number of colors left is \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors.

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"To determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we start by calculating the height of Mattison's two-story house. Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall and his house is 7 times as high as he is, the height of the house is:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we calculate the height of the first floor to the ceiling, which is thrice Mattison's height:

\[ 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The height of the house is the sum of the height of the first floor to the ceiling and the height of the second floor. Let \( h \) represent the height of the second floor. Therefore, we have:

\[ 180 \text{ inches} + h = 420 \text{ inches} \]

Solving for \( h \):

\[ h = 420 \text{ inches} - 180 \text{ inches} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Thus, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To determine how many shells team Gogetters found, we start by calculating the number of shells found by team Alphas. Since team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells:

\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information provided about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

Given:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

The miles needed for the first three dogs are:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home. His house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that. He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. To find out how much money he had leftover after paying debt, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the loan amount:
\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

2. Calculate the amount used to pay off debts:
\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

3. Calculate the leftover amount:
\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

Adding these weights together gives us the total weight of the tunas:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the tunas. Since the cost per kilogram of tuna is $0.50, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas to the market."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
2. Subtract the buying price from the selling price to find the profit.

Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines for $72. Therefore, the selling price is:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11 = 9 \times 11 = 99
\]
So, the selling price is $99.

Next, we calculate the profit by subtracting the buying price from the selling price:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buying Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is \(\boxed{27}\)."

1. **Low Setting:**
   - Removes 1 liter per day.
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on low setting: \(1 \, \text{liter/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 3 \, \text{liters}\).

2. **Medium Setting:**
   - Removes twice as much water as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2 \, \text{liters/day}\).
   - Brian ran it for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on medium setting: \(2 \, \text{liters/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 6 \, \text{liters}\).

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) be the number of strawberry cubes and \( B \) be the number of blueberry cubes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

"To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of marbles Dallas originally received from Mazie.
2. Adjust for the marbles Dallas dropped.
3. Subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total Mazie had initially to find out how many were given to Darla.

Dallas ended up with 21 marbles after dropping 4. Therefore, the number of marbles Dallas originally received is:
\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Mazie originally had 52 marbles. Subtracting the 25 marbles she gave to Dallas, we find the number of marbles given to Darla:
\[ 52 - 25 = 27 \]

Thus, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine the total cost for the family's visit to the cinema, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets and the popcorns separately and then sum them up.

"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required for the tables and then subtract that from the total number of screws James has.

Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, each table requires:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is putting together 4 tables, the total number of screws needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"The first basket contains 10 eggs. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, which amounts to \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is \(10 + 20 = 30\).

"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls for the carnival, we need to calculate the contributions of each individual and then sum them up.

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by all four girls:
\[ 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race based on the given information.

1. **Distance Run by Each:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Aaron's Speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Therefore, Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Vanessa's Speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Time Taken by Vanessa:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes."

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we need to find the selling price per watermelon, given a profit of 25%. The selling price per watermelon is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price per watermelon} \times (1 + \text{Profit percentage}) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 \]
\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of the individuals involved and then calculate the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

1. **Determine Dora's Current Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's Current Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's Current Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is now 18, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the Age of John's Youngest Son:**
   - The youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is now 37, the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the Age of the Youngest Son in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of John's youngest son in 3 years will be \(\boxed{8}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( k \) be the number of cows. We know the following:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

To eliminate \( c \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza each person can have if Henry and his 3 friends share 7 pizzas equally. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

First, calculate the total number of pizza slices:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, determine the number of people sharing the pizzas:
\[ 1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ (friends)} = 4 \text{ people} \]

Now, divide the total number of slices by the number of people to find out how many slices each person can have:
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.
