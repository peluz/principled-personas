"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Subtract the total cost (purchase price + repair cost) from the new value of the house to find the profit.

First, let's calculate the new value of the house. The original purchase price of the house is $80,000. The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, so we need to find 150% of the original purchase price and add it to the original purchase price.

The increase in value is:
\[ 1.5 \times 80,000 = 120,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Josh incurred, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Now, we find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the new value of the house:
\[ 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000 \]

Therefore, Josh's profit is:
\(\boxed{70000}\)"

"Eliza's earnings for the week can be calculated by breaking down her hours into regular and overtime hours and applying the appropriate rates.

- Regular hours: 40 hours at $10 per hour.
  - Regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

- Overtime hours: 5 hours (since she worked a total of 45 hours).
  - Overtime rate = 1.2 times the regular rate = 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hour.
  - Overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

- Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
  - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460."
"The program had 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, which amounts to:

"To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point where the total profit equals or exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Annual Growth and Revenue**: Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.5/\text{year}
   \]
3. **Annual Expenses**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

4. **Net Annual Profit**: The net profit each year is the revenue minus the expenses:
   \[
   \$10.5/\text{year} - \$3/\text{year} = \$7.5/\text{year}
   \]

5. **Break-Even Point**: To find out how many years it will take to break even, we need to determine how many years it takes for the net profit to equal the initial cost of $90:
   \[
   \text{Number of years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5/\text{year}} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos \(\boxed{12}\) years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. Therefore, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners. After this sale, she had 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 6 to clear the fraction, we get:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   Adding 6 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance. This means 4 students (20% of 20) are in contemporary dance. The remaining students are:

1. Calculate the total distance from the first stop to the end of the trip:
   \[ 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

2. Since the second stop was 15 miles before the end, we subtract 15 miles from the 40 miles:
   \[ 40 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is \(\boxed{25}\) miles."
"Certainly! Let's approach this problem step-by-step using historical reasoning and logical deduction.

Given:
- One pair of high heels costs $33.
- The other pair of high heels costs twice as much, which is $66.
- The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots.

First, calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, this total cost is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ \text{Cost of boots} - 5 = 99 \]

To find the cost of the boots, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ \text{Cost of boots} = 99 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Cost of boots} = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{104}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for Darrell and Allen's current ages based on the given ratio. Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

Given that the sum of their current ages is 162, we can write the equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now that we have the value of \(x\), we can find Allen's current age:
\[11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\]

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Gunter's friends made the following guesses about the number of jelly beans in the jar:
1. The first friend guessed 80.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first guess, which is \( \frac{80}{2} + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \).
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first guess, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \).

To find the average of these guesses, we add them together and divide by the number of guesses:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is \(\boxed{80}\)."

- Let \( G \) be the number of gold coins.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can write these as equations:
1. \( S + G = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 40 \) back into the second equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has \(\boxed{70}\) gold coins."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. First, we need to determine how many jewels Aaron has. We know that Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
2. Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we calculate 25% of 4 points and add it to the original 4 points:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Adding the points from both halves of the game, we get:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total points Mike scored is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, he eats \(2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}\).

2. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:**
   - Each set contains 4 yogurts.
   - The number of sets is \(\frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets}\).

3. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets of 4 yogurts:**
   - Each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00.
   - The total cost is \(15 \text{ sets} \times 5 \text{ dollars/set} = 75 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and sells them for $15 each. After buying 8 video games for $20 each, he has $5 left. We need to determine how many lego sets he still has.

First, calculate the total amount of money John gets from selling the lego sets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total cost of the 8 video games:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the video games and the leftover money from the total money he had to find out how much money he spent on the lego sets:
\[ 195 - 160 - 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

This $30 is the amount of money he would have if he had sold a certain number of lego sets. Since each lego set is sold for $15, the number of lego sets he still has is:
\[ \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine John's running speed, we need to analyze the information given and calculate the distance he runs each day.

1. **Distance run on the first day:**
   John runs 3 hours on the first day. Let's denote his speed as \( v \) miles per hour. Therefore, the distance he runs on the first day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on the first day} = 3v \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance run on the other two days:**
   On the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day. So, the distance he runs each of these days is:
   \[
   \text{Distance on each of the other two days} = \frac{3v}{2} \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance run in a week:**
   The total distance John runs in a week is the sum of the distances run on each of the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v}{2} + \frac{3v}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 3v + \frac{3v + 3v}{2} = 3v + 3v = 6v \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Given total distance:**
   We know that John runs 60 miles a week. Therefore:
   \[
   6v = 60
   \]

5. **Solving for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

So, John runs at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running and walking speeds based on her skipping speed and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours given the time spent running and walking.

Given:
- Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.
- Her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed.

From this, we can determine her running speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 3 \text{ mph} \times 2 = 6 \text{ mph} \]

Next, we know her running speed is four times her walking speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent running and walking in the six-hour period:
- One-third of the time running:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
- Two-thirds of the time walking:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the distance covered while running and walking:
- Distance running:
\[ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
- Distance walking:
\[ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances to find the total distance traveled:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

1. We start with Suzy's iPhone, which is explicitly stated to be 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, the age of Ben's iPhone is:
   \[
   2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is:
   \[
   4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the age of Brandon's iPhone is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the throwing distance of the javelin when Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone.
2. Subtract the dragon's reach from this distance to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand.

Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, the throwing distance with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the throwing distance:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Certainly! Let's approach this problem step-by-step using historical reasoning and calculation.

First, we need to determine the total number of pie pieces available initially. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and current consumption, let's break it down:

1. **Calories per Gram Calculation:**
   - A 300g bag of chips contains 5 servings, with each serving having 250 calories.
   - Total calories in the bag = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.
   - Calories per gram = 1250 calories / 300g = 4.17 calories/g.

2. **Remaining Calories:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

3. **Grams You Can Eat:**
   - Given that 1 gram of chips contains 4.17 calories, the number of grams you can eat with 200 calories is:
   - Grams you can eat = 200 calories / 4.17 calories/g ≈ 48 grams.

Therefore, you can eat approximately 48 grams of the chips."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of beeswax needed:**
   - Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - Therefore, to make 20 candles, he needs:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles/pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, for 2 pounds of beeswax, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from 20 candles is:
     \[
     20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Therefore, the net profit is:
     \[
     \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics. Each article takes her an average of 4 hours to research and write. Let's break down the number of articles she wrote each day:

- **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
- **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote over the three days:

"John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

First, calculate the number of blue ties:
\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Next, determine the number of red ties:
\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Calculate the cost of each red tie:
\[
\text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount spent:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does in pounds.
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so Sarah does \( 4D \) pounds of laundry.
3. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can set up the equation:
   \[ 4D = 400 \]
4. Solving for \( D \):
   \[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]
   Therefore, David does 100 pounds of laundry.
5. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, Raymond does:
   \[ \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]
   Therefore, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

"In the context of the problem presented, we are dealing with a straightforward algebraic scenario involving a football team's game outcomes. Let's denote the number of games won by the team as \( W \) and the number of games lost as \( L \).

From the problem statement, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of games played is 22.
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost.

We can translate these into the following equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

To solve for \( L \), we substitute the second equation into the first:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
\[ 2L = 14 \]
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the second equation to find \( W \):
\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

"Certainly! Let's approach this problem step-by-step using historical reasoning and analysis.

Given:
- Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.
- In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam.
- In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
- 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam.

We need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes:
\[ x + 20 \]

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 25 - 20 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Mary is an avid gardener. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her large country home. Feeling generous, she has decided that she will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. 

To determine how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary already has:
   \[
   2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of potted plants she will give away:
   \[
   1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

3. Subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants she already has:
   \[
   80 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

4. Add the 18 new potted plants she received from the nursery:
   \[
   40 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can use the given information about the fog bank's speed. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time per mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we calculate the time to cover 42 miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[
\boxed{140}

"To determine the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box. Given that the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension of the box to find the inner dimensions.

The original dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. Subtracting 2 inches (1 inch from each side) gives us the inner dimensions:
- Length: \(5 - 2 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the inner volume of one box:
\[ \text{Volume of one box} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Frankie watches TV after finishing his homework every night. Let's break down the information given:

- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, totaling 2 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, totaling 2 hours.
- In total, he watched 7 hours of TV.

Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday. Each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours. Therefore, the total time for Wednesday is \( 0.5x \) hours.

The equation for the total hours of TV watched is:

\[ 2 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 0.5x \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 7 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 7 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5.5 + 0.5x = 7 \]

Subtract 5.5 from both sides:

\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Divide both sides by 0.5:

\[ x = 3 \]

So, Frankie watched 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wanted to bake twice as many as last year, which would be \( 2x \).
3. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. According to the problem, he now has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
6. To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
7. Then, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon.
2. Calculate the total cashback for 10 gallons at $0.20 per gallon.
3. Subtract the total cashback from the total cost to find the final cost.

"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person ate and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate:
- Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is \(2 \times 24 = 48\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate:
- Marcell's roll-ups are 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- Therefore, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is \(3 \times 14 = 42\).

Now, we add the totals from both:
- Combined total = \(48 + 42 = 90\).

Finally, we find the average:
- Average = \(\frac{90}{2} = 45\).

Thus, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how much water Julia's boat had taken on by the time she reached the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Julia needs to row to reach the shore.
2. Determine the rate at which water is entering the boat.
3. Calculate the total time it takes for Julia to reach the shore.
4. Use the rate of water intake and the total time to find the total amount of water taken on.

First, we know that the shore is 64 seconds away and it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, the rate at which she rows is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{5 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ seconds}} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she needs to row to reach the shore:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds per 20 feet}} \times 20 \text{ feet} = 64 \text{ seconds} \times \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the rate of water intake is:
\[ \text{Rate of water intake} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} \]

To find the total amount of water taken on, we multiply the total distance rowed by the rate of water intake:
\[ \text{Total water taken on} = 80 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1 \text{ liter}}{5 \text{ feet}} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Thus, the total amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\)."
"Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions and another test today that consisted of 100 questions. He completed both tests at a rate of 5 questions per hour. He had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours to complete the second one.

To determine how many questions he left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he completed in each test and then subtract that from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

Number of questions completed in the first test:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ questions} \]

Number of questions left incomplete in the first test:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \]

For the second test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Number of questions completed in the second test:
\[ 5 \text{ questions/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ questions} \]

Number of questions left incomplete in the second test:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \]

Total number of questions left incomplete:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"In the context of the problem presented, we are dealing with a simple arithmetic relationship between the number of pink and blue gumballs in a candy machine. The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs, and \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs. According to the problem, we have:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substituting the given number of blue gumballs (\( B = 12 \)) into the equation, we get:
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Performing the multiplication and addition:
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we start by identifying the number of each type of car available for rent. Given that there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual, we can calculate the number of semi-automatic cars as follows:

Total cars = 20
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Number of semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total cars) × 100
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) × 100 = 0.2 × 100 = 20%

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( Q \) represent the number of queen bees.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so the number of baby bees \( B \) is \( 2Q \).
3. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so the number of worker bees \( W \) is \( 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q \).
4. The total number of bees is 700, so we can write the equation: \( Q + B + W = 700 \).
5. Substitute \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \) into the equation: \( Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \).
6. Combine like terms: \( 7Q = 700 \).
7. Solve for \( Q \): \( Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100 \).
8. Now, find the number of worker bees \( W \): \( W = 4Q = 4(100) = 400 \).

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \(\boxed{400}\)."

"John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and roach traps for $4. There is a 10% tax on all non-food items. Let's break down the costs:

- Milk and eggs are food items, totaling $2 + $3 = $5.
- Light bulbs and cups are non-food items, totaling $3 + $3 = $6.
- Roach traps are also a non-food item, adding $4 to the non-food total.

The subtotal for non-food items is $6 + $4 = $10. With a 10% tax on these items, the tax amount is $10 * 0.10 = $1. Therefore, the total cost for non-food items after tax is $10 + $1 = $11.

Adding the cost of the food items, the total cost is $5 (food) + $11 (non-food with tax) = $16.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's work through the sequence of events step by step, starting from the end and moving backward.

1. **Final State**: After the ants carried off the last fry, 5 fries were left.
2. **Before Ants**: Before the ants, there was 1 additional fry, so there were \(5 + 1 = 6\) fries.
3. **Before Raccoon**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries, leaving one-third. Therefore, before the raccoon, there were \(6 \times 3 = 18\) fries.
4. **Before Pigeons**: The three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Therefore, before the pigeons, there were \(18 + 9 = 27\) fries.
5. **Before Seagull**: The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, and Dave ate 14 fries. So, the seagull ate \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries. Therefore, before the seagull, there were \(27 + 7 = 34\) fries.
6. **Initial State**: Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull took the pack. Therefore, the initial number of fries in the pack was \(34 + 14 = 48\).

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{48}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his weekly schedule and then multiply by the number of weeks in the semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends in classes on a typical week:

- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes each day. So, for these three days, he spends:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} \times 3 \text{ classes/day} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day. So, for these two days, he spends:
  \[
  2 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 2 \text{ classes/day} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of hours he spends in classes in one week:
\[
9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in classes over the entire semester, which is 16 weeks long:

"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( \$20 \)
   - Increase rate: 20% every two months

2. **Convert the percentage increase to a decimal:**
   \[
   20\% = 0.20
   \]

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/period}} = 18 \text{ periods}

4. **Calculate the price after each two-month period:**
   The price after each period can be calculated using the formula for compound interest:
   \[
   P_{n} = P_{0} \times (1 + r)^n
   \]
   where:
   - \( P_{0} \) is the original price (\$20)
   - \( r \) is the rate of increase (0.20)
   - \( n \) is the number of periods (18)

5. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   \[
   P_{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   Using a calculator:
   \[
   (1.20)^{18} \approx 39.366

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant, we need to compare the cost of hiring the accountant to the lost income from doing her taxes herself.

1. Calculate the lost income from doing her taxes herself:
   - She loses $35 for each hour of freelance work.
   - She will be doing 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Therefore, the lost income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

2. Compare the lost income to the cost of hiring the accountant:
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - The lost income from doing her taxes herself is $105.

3. Determine the difference:
   - If Jackie hires the accountant, she will save the $105 in lost income.
   - The accountant charges $90, so the net gain is \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \).

Therefore, Jackie will have \(\$15\) more if she hires the accountant.

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

Let \( B \) be Brooke's current age and \( S \) be Seth's current age. According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write:
\[ S = 2B \]

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \). The sum of their ages in 2 years is given as 28, so we can write:
\[ (B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[ B + S + 4 = 28 \]
\[ B + S = 24 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation \( B + S = 24 \):
\[ B + 2B = 24 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), we can find Seth's age:

3. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pants} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants to find the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"To determine the total age of the four birds, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's age**: Given as 8 years old.
2. **Sally Four's age**: Since Sally Thirtytwo is the same age as Sally Four, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. **Granny Red's age**: Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Therefore, Granny Red's age is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. **Sally Two's age**: Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Thus, Sally Two's age is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we sum the ages of all four birds:

- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Adding these together:

\[ 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \]

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we first need to calculate her total minimum monthly payment for all her debts. The minimum payments are as follows:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Adding these together gives the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. Therefore, we need to calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \]
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the total monthly payment by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the amount Jessica pays in a year is:
\[ \boxed{18000} \]"
"To determine the total time Billy will spend prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for both peeling and cutting.

1. **Peeled Potatoes:**
   - Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes
   - Total number of potatoes: 60

"Given the scenario, let's break down Zaid's monthly expenses and donations step by step.

1. **Rent**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Car fuel**: Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Donation to charity**: Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining amount after donation**:

"Given the information, we can determine Jean's age by first finding Mark's current age. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Jan's age two years ago was 28, so half of Jan's age at that time was 14. Therefore, two years ago, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old. This means Mark is currently \(19 + 2 = 21\) years old. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean is \(21 + 2 = 23\) years old.

**Final Answer: Jean is 23 years old.**"
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference between these times.

**Faster Team:**
Each of the four runners completes the 400 meters in 55 seconds.
Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

**Less Well-Rounded Team:**
The first runner completes the 400 meters in 60 seconds.
The second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first, so the second runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 57 \text{ seconds} \]
The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, so the third runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 57 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 54 \text{ seconds} \]
The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third, so the fourth runner completes the 400 meters in:
\[ 54 \text{ seconds} - 3 \text{ seconds} = 51 \text{ seconds} \]
Total time for the less well-rounded team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 212 \text{ seconds} \]

**Difference in Time:**
The difference in time between the faster team and the less well-rounded team is:

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of both events and then compare them.

### Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

### Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is:
\[ P(\text{even number}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \]

### Comparing the probabilities
Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the ratio of the two probabilities and then converting it to a percentage.

The ratio of the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 to the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:
\[ \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers in a row})} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2 \]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200\% \]

So, the number greater than 3 is 200% more likely to occur than rolling two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200\%} \]"

"The problem involves distributing straw among different types of rodents. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Hamsters:**
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.

2. **Rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

3. **Rats:**
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw for hamsters = 50 pieces.
   - Straw for rabbits = 20 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = \(160 - 50 - 20 = 90\) pieces.
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - Number of rats = \(\frac{90}{6} = 15\).

4. **Rats in Cages:**

2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: 2% or 0.02

**Month 1:**
- Interest for the first month: \(100 \times 0.02 = 2\)
- Total amount after the first month: \(100 + 2 = 102\)

**Month 2:**
- Interest for the second month: \(102 \times 0.02 = 2.04\)
- Total amount after the second month: \(102 + 2.04 = 104.04\)

**Month 3:**
- Interest for the third month: \(104.04 \times 0.02 = 2.0808\)
- Total amount after the third month: \(104.04 + 2.0808 = 106.1208\)

Rounding to the nearest cent, the total amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is \(\boxed{106.12}\)."
"To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to analyze the costs and revenues involved. Let's denote the number of bags by \( x \).

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of buying each bag is $20, so the total cost for buying \( x \) bags is \( 20x \) dollars.
   - The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags is \( 2x \) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - The revenue from selling each bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - According to the problem, the profit is $400.
   - So, we have the equation: \( 30x - 22x = 400 \).

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   30x - 22x = 400
   \]
   \[
   8x = 400
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
   \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:**
   - The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
   - The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
     \[
     \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for tickets and food is:
     \[
     20.25 + 15.75 = 36
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the rides:**
   - Each ride costs $33, and they went on 2 rides, so:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of rides} = 33 \times 2 = 66
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Adding the cost of the tickets, food, and rides:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 36 + 66 = 102
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount each friend paid:**
   - Since the three friends agreed to split the total cost evenly:
     \[
     \text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{102}{3} = 34
     \]

Therefore, each of them paid:
\[

"To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we start by calculating the total weekly requirement for the flock. Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for ten ducks, the total weekly requirement is:

\[ 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Next, we convert the weekly requirement into a daily requirement by dividing the total weekly amount by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[ \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees per year**: Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees each year, resulting in a net increase of:
   \[
   10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
   \]
3. **Number of trees after 10 years**: Over 10 years, the total net increase in trees is:
   \[
   8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees}

"Mark is a copy-editor who edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers. Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays. He edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   Since he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher and the total is 1000 sentences, he edits:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher A}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences for Publisher B}
   \]

2. **Calculate the payment from Publisher A:**
   Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, Mark earns:
   \[
   500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the payment from Publisher B:**
   Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A per sentence, so Publisher B pays:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents per sentence}
   \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy. We know that Joe's bag contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.

First, we calculate the weight of each candied apple:
\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{g}}{2} = 20 \text{g} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{g} = 1000 \text{g} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{g} = 1600 \text{g} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{g} + 1600 \text{g} = 2600 \text{g} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the historical context and mathematical principles involved.

Given:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs a day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs a day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). According to the problem, we have:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the current amount of water in the small pool.
   - Let \( B \) be the current amount of water in the big pool.

2. **Understand the Rate of Water Loss:**
   - Both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

3. **Formulate the Equations:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons.
   - According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
     \[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

"Given the problem, let's determine the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack step by step.

1. Harriet's current age is 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack's current age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's current age is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Next, we calculate their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack's age in three years will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian's age in three years will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

Now, we find the average of their ages in three years:
\[

"Certainly! Let's approach this problem from a historical perspective, focusing on the efficient use of resources, which is a common theme throughout history.

Ram starts with 25 pens. Each time he uses 5 pens, he can create 1 new pen. This process can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.
2. **First Cycle**: Using 25 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
   \]
   After this cycle, he has:
   \[
   25 - 25 + 5 = 5 \text{ pens}
   \]
3. **Second Cycle**: Using the 5 pens, he can make:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]
   After this cycle, he has:
   \[
   5 - 5 + 1 = 1 \text{ pen}
   \]
4. **Final Check**: With 1 pen left, he cannot make any more new pens since he needs 5 pens to make 1 new pen.

Adding up all the pens, Ram ends up with:
\[
25 + 5 + 1 = 31 \text{ pens}
\]

**Final Answer**:
\[
\boxed{31}

"To determine the number of students who went out through exit C, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A, which is 30% of 1000.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

2. Subtract the number of students who went out through exit A from the total number of students to find the remaining students.
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students remain.

3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B, which is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420

"Mike was a pen pal with 5 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them. They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long. He responds in kind. He can write a page every 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing a week?

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Number of pen pals left**: Mike originally had 5 pen pals and stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now pen pals with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Letters sent and received**: Each of the 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives in a week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters.

3. **Letters Mike sends**: Since Mike responds in kind, he also sends 6 letters a week.

4. **Total pages written**: Each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is \(6 \text{ (letters sent)} + 6 \text{ (letters received)} \times 5 \text{ (pages per letter)} = 6 + 30 = 36\) pages.

5. **Time spent writing**: Mike writes a page every 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent writing 36 pages is \(36 \times 6 = 216\) minutes.

6. **Convert minutes to hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, the total time spent writing in hours is \(\frac{216}{60} = 3.6\) hours.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering Griffin's french fries as our historical context.

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, leaving Griffin with \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. This leaves Griffin with \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. This leaves Griffin with \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

   - Rick killed 15 cougars.

2. **Today's Hunt:**
   - Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
   - Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night.

From the information given:
- Let the number of cougars killed today be \(C\).
- Therefore, the number of wolves killed today is \(3C\).
- Since Rick killed three fewer cougars today than the previous night, \(C = 15 - 3 = 12\).

So, today:
- Rick killed \(3 \times 12 = 36\) wolves.
- Rick killed 12 cougars.

   - Therefore, the time to heat to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.
3. **Cooking the chicken:** This takes 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees.
   - Time to cook the chicken is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

Adding these times together gives the total time:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is \(\boxed{71}\) minutes."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bag contains 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag contains 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it contains \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag contains half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it contains \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add up the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"To determine the total number of windows between the houses, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Bedroom Windows:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows per house due to bedrooms is \(3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}\).
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of bedroom windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 6 \text{ windows/house} = 12 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Since there are 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is \(2 \text{ houses} \times 4 \text{ windows/house} = 8 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Total Windows:**
   - The total number of windows is the sum of the bedroom windows and the additional windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows is \(12 \text{ bedroom windows} + 8 \text{ additional windows} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

The total number of windows between the houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."

"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the first scene are \(\frac{108}{3} = 36\).

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's.
   - Therefore, Sean's lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\).

4. **Total Lines to Memorize:**
   - Adding up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
     - Solo song: 54 lines
     - First scene: 36 lines

"In 10 years, the sum of Mico and Marco's ages will be 30.

**Explanation:**
Currently, the sum of their ages is 20. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older. Therefore, the total additional age for both of them combined will be 20 years. Adding this to their current total age, we get \(20 + 20 = 30\).

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's define the current ages of Ruby and Sam with variables:
- Let \( R \) be Ruby's current age.
- Let \( S \) be Sam's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can translate these pieces of information into equations:
1. \( R = 6S \)
2. In 9 years, Ruby's age will be \( R + 9 \) and Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

Now, substitute the first equation \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
\]

Next, expand and simplify the equation:
\[
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
\]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[
3S + 9 = 27
\]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3S = 18
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
S = 6
\]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas combined and then find half of that total.

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba has:
\[ \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots, so the total number of spots for the cobras is:
\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots, so the total number of spots for the mambas is:
\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:
\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total number of spots:
\[ \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total amount of money Kelly has in cents. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters amount to \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes amount to \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.

Adding these together, Kelly has a total of \(125 + 20 = 145\) cents.

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has.

Therefore, the amount of cents Kelly will have left is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To determine the number of 5-star rows on the 76-star flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars.

First, we calculate the stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the stars in the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stars in the 3 rows of 8 stars and the 2 rows of 6 stars:
\[ 24 + 12 = 36 \]

Subtracting this from the total number of stars on the flag (76) gives the number of stars in the 5-star rows:
\[ 76 - 36 = 40 \]

To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of 5-star stars by 5:
\[ \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, each weighing 75 pounds, with a truck capacity of 2000 pounds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.
2. Determine how many trucks are needed based on the total weight and the truck capacity.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones.**

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight of 80 flagstones is:
\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many trucks are needed.**

Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:

"Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. but takes a 30-minute break. The total working time is 3 hours minus 30 minutes, which equals 2.5 hours. Converting 2.5 hours into minutes gives us 150 minutes. Since she earns $5 for every 10 minutes, we divide 150 minutes by 10 to find the number of 10-minute intervals: 150 / 10 = 15 intervals. Therefore, her total earnings are 15 intervals * $5 per interval = $75.

The final amount Susan earns for the online task is \boxed{75}."
"In the game played by Mike, Jim, and Tony, the points after the first three rounds are as follows:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, which is \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more than Mike, which is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

In the fourth round, each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points:
- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(21 + 1 = 22\) points.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not get an extra point, keeping his total at 18 points.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, making his total \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

The total points of all three players after the extra points are distributed is:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household where each of the 5 members consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per meal by the household:
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 members in the household.
   - Therefore, the total consumption per meal is \(5 \times 0.2 = 1\) kg.

2. Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day:
   - Since they eat rice at both lunch and dinner, the total consumption per day is \(1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}\).

3. Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total consumption per week is \(2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week}\).

"To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process. Each piece of paper, when folded in half, produces four pages: two on the front and two on the back.

Given that the tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required by dividing the total number of pages by the number of pages produced per piece of paper.

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece}} = 8
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper used in a 32-page tabloid is \(\boxed{8}\)."

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total Books in Collection**: 250
2. **Books Remaining Unsold**: 50
3. **Books Sold This Year**: 45
4. **Price per Book**: $20
5. **Books Sold in the First Year**: Twice the number sold this year, which is \(2 \times 45 = 90\)

First, calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
\[ \text{Total Books Sold} = \text{Total Books} - \text{Books Remaining Unsold} = 250 - 50 = 200 \]

Next, determine the number of books sold in the second year:
\[ \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} = \text{Total Books Sold} - \text{Books Sold in the First Year} - \text{Books Sold This Year} \]
\[ \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} = 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 \]

Finally, calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:
\[ \text{Money Earned in the Second Year} = \text{Books Sold in the Second Year} \times \text{Price per Book} \]
\[ \text{Money Earned in the Second Year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]
3. This means that the number of loaves left after the morning sales is:
   \[
   60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]
4. Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Cera's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
   - Therefore, Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old six years ago.

3. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Noah was 20 years old six years ago.
   - So, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - Noah's age six years ago was 20, so the population six years ago was \(3000 \times 20 = 60000\).

5. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply every term by 2:
\[ 6D + D = 210 \]
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Martha is planning her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. This means she invited a total of \(2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\) people. 

However, 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and \(\frac{1}{4}\) of that number (8) had previous commitments. So, \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) people had previous commitments. 

Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is \(8 + 2 = 10\). 

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited, we get \(24 - 10 = 14\).

So, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Solomon initially bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
2. The store already had 50 marbles.
3. Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles, his father gave him \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8\) marbles.

Now, let's calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:
\[ 20 \text{ (bought from Johanna)} + 50 \text{ (already in the store)} + 8 \text{ (from his father)} = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2kgs, so the total weight of the marbles is:

"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required as follows:

1. Let the number of electric poles be \( P \) and the number of electric wires be \( W \).
2. According to the ratio, \( P:W = 1:3 \).
3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.
4. Given \( W = 45 \), we can set up the proportion: \( \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \).
5. Substituting \( W = 45 \) into the proportion, we get \( \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \).
6. Solving for \( P \), we multiply both sides by 45: \( P = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \)."

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total number of pencils Jam has. According to the problem, Jam has three boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26 \]

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

\[ \text{Number of pencils in boxes} = 24 \]

Since these 24 pencils are distributed equally among 3 boxes, each box contains:

\[ \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of pencils that Jam and Meg have together. Jam has 26 pencils and Meg has 46 pencils, so:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To store all 72 pencils, we need to determine how many boxes are required. Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is, we need to consider both the cooling effect of the ice cubes and the weakening effect of the added cream.

1. **Calculate the number of ice cubes needed:**
   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
   \[
   \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes:**
   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weakening effect of the cream:**
   Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which also weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.

4. **Calculate the total weakening effect:**
   The total weakening effect is the sum of the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:
   \[
   60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
   \]

Therefore, Shannon’s iced coffee is \(\boxed{75}\) milliliters weaker."

     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of senior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of senior programmers is:
     \[
     100 - 40 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the total payment to junior programmers:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Therefore, the total payment to junior programmers is:
     \[
     40 \times 2000 = 80000
     \]

4. **Calculate the payment to senior programmers:**
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid:
     \[
     2000 + 400 = 2400 \text{ per month}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total payment to senior programmers is:
     \[
     60 \times 2400 = 144000
     \]

5. **Calculate the total payment to all programmers:**
   - The total payment to all programmers is the sum of the payments to junior and senior programmers:
     \[
     80000 + 144000 = 224000
     \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus, so the total number of people on the bus became \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus became \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We know that at the third bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]
5. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, leaving him with \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops. He then passes 14 lollipops to his friends, so he has \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) lollipops. Adding these to the 8 lollipops he has left, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops. That night, he eats 3 lollipops, leaving him with \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops. In the morning, he eats 2 more lollipops, so he has \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops left.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We have a total of 200 students divided into 3 groups. Two of these groups are of equal size, and the third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two larger groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students can be represented by the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two larger groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:
\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Certainly! Let's approach this problem step-by-step using historical and logical reasoning.

Given:
- Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals.
- The animals are either chickens or cows.
- There are twice as many chickens as cows.

Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ H = 2C \]
\[ H + C = 60 \]

Substituting \( H = 2C \) into the second equation:
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, the number of cows is 20. Now, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Cows have 4 legs each, and chickens have 2 legs each. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4C + 2H \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts by juggling 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. By the end of the fourth week, he can juggle:

\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ balls} \]

So, the final number of balls Josh starts juggling on stage is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, including the container itself. We are provided with the weight of the pink frog, which is 50 pounds, and the relationships between the weights of the other animals.

1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, so:
   - Blue beetle = 50 pounds
   - Green toad = 50 pounds

2. The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so:
   - Yellow snake = 50 + 10 = 60 pounds

3. The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
   - Red bird = 50 - 20 = 30 pounds

The container itself weighs 20 pounds. Now, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal:

- Pink frog = 50 pounds
- Blue beetle = 50 pounds
- Green toad = 50 pounds
- Yellow snake = 60 pounds
- Red bird = 30 pounds
- Container = 20 pounds

Total weight = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, plus the container itself, is 260 pounds."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Friday**: The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
2. **Saturday**: The store sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, which is \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pairs.
3. **Sunday**: The store sold one-half the amount that they did on Saturday, which is \(28 \div 2 = 14\) pairs. However, six pairs were returned, so the actual number of pairs sold on Sunday is \(14 - 6 = 8\) pairs.

Now, let's sum up the total number of pairs sold over the three days:
- Friday: 14 pairs
- Saturday: 28 pairs
- Sunday: 8 pairs

The total number of pairs sold is \(14 + 28 + 8 = 50\) pairs.

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

First, let's calculate the interest for five months. The annual interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest rate is:

\[ \text{Interest rate for 5 months} = \frac{10\% \times 5}{12} = \frac{10 \times 5}{1200} = \frac{50}{1200} = \frac{1}{24} \approx 0.04167 \]

Now, we calculate the total interest on the principal amount of $3,650:

\[ \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08 \]

So, the total amount Karan will owe after five months is the principal plus the interest:

\[ \text{Total amount} = 3650 + 152.08 = 3802.08 \]

Since she has to pay this amount in equal monthly installments over five months, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} = 760.42 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is:

\[ \boxed{760.42} \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the ratio and the total number of popsicles. The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles.

First, we find the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \]

This means the total number of popsicles (165) is divided into 11 parts. To find the value of one part, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can determine the number of popsicles each person has:
- Betty has 5 parts, so:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
- Sam has 6 parts, so:
\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

The final answer is:

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner when it is used for 8 hours a day. The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour. Therefore, for 8 hours, the energy consumption is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watts} \]

Since 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts, we convert the energy consumption to kilowatts:
\[ 7200 \, \text{watts} = 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Next, we calculate the daily energy consumption if the usage is reduced by 5 hours a day. This means the air conditioner is used for:
\[ 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

The energy consumption for 3 hours is:
\[ 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watts} \]
Converting to kilowatts:
\[ 2700 \, \text{watts} = 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Now, we find the daily savings in energy consumption:
\[ 7.2 \, \text{kilowatts} - 2.7 \, \text{kilowatts} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

To find the total savings over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by 30:
\[ 4.5 \, \text{kilowatts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kilowatts} \]

Therefore, the total kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

"Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps a day. He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which amounts to 5,000 steps. He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. After his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. 

To find out how many steps he had taken before his jog, we subtract the remaining steps from his daily goal:
\[ 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps} \]

Next, we calculate the total steps he had taken before his jog:
\[ 5,000 \text{ (to and from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (short walk)} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

The steps taken during his jog are the difference between the steps taken before the jog and the total steps taken before the jog:
\[ 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is \(\boxed{2000}\)."
"Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long, with an average of 200 words per page. First, we calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it will take him to read the book, we divide the total number of words by his reading rate:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

After finishing the book, Toby needs 10 more minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, the total time from the start of reading until he leaves for the airport is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, the number of minutes early he will be is:

"Sally went to the seashore for vacation and was given $10 by her parents to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale with a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. She bought 2 pounds of taffy, a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50, and 4 magnets at $0.25 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy:
- The first pound of taffy costs $3.
- The second pound is 1/2 off, so it costs $3 * 0.5 = $1.50.
- Therefore, the total cost for the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the seashells and magnets:
- The seashells cost $1.50.
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the total cost for the magnets is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.
- Therefore, the total cost for the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
- The total cost is $4.50 (taffy) + $2.50 (seashells and magnets) = $7.00.

Sally started with $10. After spending $7.00, the amount of money she has left is:
- $10 - $7.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, the final amount of money Sally has left is \boxed{3}."
"To determine how much Tim spent in total, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. The first package of fireworks costs $400.
2. The second package costs twice as much as the first, so it costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
3. The total cost of the two packages before the discount is \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.
4. Tim gets a 20% discount on the total cost of the two packages, so the discount amount is \(1200 \times 0.20 = 240\) dollars.
5. The cost after the discount is \(1200 - 240 = 960\) dollars.
6. The finale firework costs $150.

Adding the cost of the discounted fireworks and the finale firework together:
\[960 + 150 = 1110\]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is \(\boxed{1110}\)."
"To determine how many dozens of madeleine cookies Shannon needs to make for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Shannon eats in 30 days.
2. Convert the total number of cookies into dozens.

Shannon eats 2 cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we need to find out how many dozens are in 60 cookies:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon needs to make \(\boxed{5}\) dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days."
"The problem involves determining the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode from a batch of 50,000 candles. Given that the candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, it means 1% of the candles will explode. Additionally, 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode, we can assume the defects are independent. Therefore, we calculate the probability of a candle both smelling like wet dog and exploding as the product of the individual probabilities.

1. Calculate the number of candles that will explode:
\[ 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500 \]

2. Calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode:
\[ 5\% \times 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 0.01 \times 50,000 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and will explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Apples Gathered by Joanne:**
   - From the tallest trees: 30 apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
   - Let the number of apples gathered from the average trees be \( x \).

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is:
   \[
   30 + 15 + x = 45 + x
   \]

2. **Apples Gathered by Joanne's Sister:**
   - From the tallest trees: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
   - From the shortest trees: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
   - From the average trees: 0 apples.

   Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne's sister gathered is:
   \[
   60 + 45 = 105
   \]

3. **Combined Total:**
   The combined total of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   45 + x + 105 = 500
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   150 + x = 500
   \]
   Subtract 150 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 500 - 150
   \]
   \[
   x = 350
   \]

So, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and humps of the camels and dromedaries.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels.
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each camel and each dromedary has one head, so the total number of heads is \( c + d = 180 \).
2. Each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, so the total number of humps is \( 2c + d = 304 \).

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

To find the number of dromedaries, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
c = 124
\]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
Solving for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - 124 = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"Tom's journey through Europe can be broken down into several segments to calculate the total distance he traveled. 

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \(200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}\).

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - He traveled 30% of the distance he covered in the first 4 days.
   - Distance for the next 2 days: \(800 \text{ km} \times 0.30 = 240 \text{ km}\).

3. **Day Without Travel:**
   - On the next day, he did not travel at all, so the distance is \(0 \text{ km}\).

4. **Second Week:**
   - He traveled 300 kilometers each day for 7 days.
   - Total distance for the second week: \(300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}\).

Adding all these distances together:
\[ 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

"The problem involves understanding the original prices of jeans before a sale and calculating the difference between these original prices. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the sale price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the jogger jeans cost \(28 - 6 = 22\) dollars during the sale.

2. **Calculate the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars.
   - The savings from the tattered jeans is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is the difference between the original price and the sale price.
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, \( x - 22 = 2 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 22 + 2 = 24 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the difference between the original prices of the tattered and jogger jeans:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of money Kenny has after selling his cards:**
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and has $50 in spending cash.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is $100 + $50 = $150.

2. **Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:**
   - Each card is sold for $1.5.
   - The number of cards sold is the total amount of money divided by the price per card: $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

"The problem involves a scenario where a food caterer prepared hotdogs for an event but had to deal with more guests than expected. Let's break it down:

1. **Initial Preparation:**
   - The caterer was supposed to prepare for 36 guests.
   - Half of the guests (18) were to have 2 hotdogs each, which means \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The other half (18) were to have 1 hotdog each, which means \(18 \times 1 = 18\) hotdogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hotdogs prepared is \(36 + 18 = 54\).

2. **Actual Situation:**
   - 40 guests showed up.
   - The first 18 guests each had 2 hotdogs, consuming \(18 \times 2 = 36\) hotdogs.
   - The remaining 22 guests each wanted 1 hotdog.
   - So, these 22 guests need \(22 \times 1 = 22\) hotdogs.
   - The total number of hotdogs needed is \(36 + 22 = 58\).

3. **Comparison:**
   - The caterer prepared 54 hotdogs.
   - 58 hotdogs were needed.
   - Therefore, the number of hotdogs short is \(58 - 54 = 4\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since each of the 22 guests who wanted a second hotdog would need 1 additional hotdog, and there are only 4 hotdogs short, 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"

3. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater, Bernadette needs to account for her 16-minute travel time and the additional 5 minutes to arrive early.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract Wayne's travel time from the total time Bernadette needs to arrive early:

\[16 \text{ minutes (Bernadette's travel time)} - 4 \text{ minutes (Wayne's travel time)} + 5 \text{ minutes (early arrival)} = 12 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom given its area and one dimension.

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet**: Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is:
   \[
   3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the width using the area formula**: The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can solve for the width:
   \[
   360 = 9 \times \text{width}
   \]
   \[
   \text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter**: The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:
\[
\boxed{98}

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[
140 - 60 = 80 \text{ pieces}
\]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth."
"When Marcus wakes up, his house is at 40 degrees. Over the next 3 hours, he bakes, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. Therefore, the temperature increase from baking is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]
Adding this to the initial temperature:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The cooling effect over 30 minutes is:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/2 degrees}} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]
Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The final temperature of the house is \(\boxed{49}\) degrees."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total time Jon took to complete the triathlon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

Total time for Jon = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon, so the time James took for the swim is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James took 5 minutes longer on the bike ride than Jon, so the time James took for the bike ride is:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( x \) be the time James took for the run. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, the total time James took is 10 minutes more than Jon's total time:
\[ 36 + 85 + x = 170 + 10 \]
\[ 121 + x = 180 \]
\[ x = 180 - 121 \]
\[ x = 59 \]

So, the time James took for the run is 59 minutes.

Final answer:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"To determine the length of Movie A, we need to follow the relationships given in the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Converting this to minutes:

   \]

2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:
   \[
   75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. Therefore, the length of Movie A is:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the length of Movie A is \(\boxed{20}\) minutes."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much hay Michael's horse consumes and then calculate the cost of that hay. Finally, we will find out how much change Michael has after purchasing the hay.

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH) for 30 minutes.
   - Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the distance is:
     \[
     32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   - The horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs.
   - For 16 miles, the horse eats:
     \[
     16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - The total cost for 8 bails of hay is:
     \[
     8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the change Michael has:**
   - Michael has six $5 bills, which is:
     \[
     6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - After buying the hay, the change is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the historical context of pricing and savings.

1. **Cost of the super ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $20
   - Popcorn with soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for the super ticket option: $20 + $1 = $21

2. **Cost of the regular ticket option:**
   - Movie ticket: $12
   - Popcorn: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
   - Soda: $3
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option: $12 + \( P \) + $3 = $15 + \( P \)

3. **Savings:**
   - You ended up saving $2 by not buying the super ticket.
   - Therefore, the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option.
   - We can set up the equation: $21 - ($15 + \( P \)) = $2

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   21 - 15 - P = 2
   \]
   \[
   6 - P = 2

"To determine the cost of the potting soil Bob needs, we first calculate the volume of soil required for one raised bed. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one raised bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost of the potting soil is:

"Miss Maria is a middle school teacher who enjoys collecting sports cards. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many students does Miss Maria have?

To solve this, we first calculate the total number of basketball cards:
\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of baseball cards:
\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

\[ \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{x}{2} + 2 \]

We know Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, so we set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat \(\boxed{6}\) carrot sticks."
"The combined length of the 2 remoras is 1 foot (since each remora is 6 inches or 0.5 feet long, and there are 2 remoras). The shark's body length is 10 feet. To find what percentage of the shark's body length the remoras represent, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1 \text{ foot}}{10 \text{ feet}} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's consider the information given: three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, and 20 students do not have a desktop computer.

If three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer, then one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. We know that this one-fourth is equal to 20 students.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of students at that grade level is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's break it down:

- There are 9 kids allergic to dairy.
- There are 6 kids allergic to peanuts.
- There are 3 kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

First, we calculate the number of kids allergic to at least one of the substances:
\[ |D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P| \]
\[ |D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both). Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |D \cup P| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to account for both the employees and the tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of 200 employees each.
- Therefore, the total number of employees is \(3 \times 200 = 600\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
- Therefore, the total number of tour guides is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

Now, we add the total number of employees and tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
- Total people = Total employees + Total tour guides
- Total people = 600 + 21 = 621.

Thus, the total number of people going on this tour is \(\boxed{621}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to calculate the expenses for both the plane tickets and the hotel stay.

     \[
     5000 \times 2 = 10000
     \]

2. **Hotel Stay:**
   - The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
   - During the busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. Therefore, the increased price per day is:
     \[
     1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   - They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is:
     \[
     1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel stay gives:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Gabriel has 20 songs on his player.
2. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has:
   \[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

3. Each player can store up to 100 songs. Therefore, the number of additional songs each can add is:
   - Gabriel can add:
     \[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]
   - Luri can add:
     \[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

4. To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
   \[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

"To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for his four horses over five days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Oat Consumption per Horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Each horse is fed twice a day.
   - Therefore, each horse consumes \(5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day}\).

2. **Total Daily Oat Consumption for All Horses:**
   - With four horses, the total daily consumption is \(10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}\).

3. **Total Oat Consumption for Five Days:**
   - Over five days, the total consumption is \(40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds}\).

4. **Number of Bags Needed:**

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost and Discount:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - The sale is ""buy one get one free,"" so if Heather buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is $4.00 (since she only pays for 1 pack).

2. **Applying the Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - After applying the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

3. **Total Number of Razors:**

"To determine the number of guests at which the two venues become equally costly, we can set up an equation based on the given costs.

Let \( x \) represent the number of guests.

**First Venue:**
- Flat fee: $200
- Food cost: $5 per guest
- Total cost: \( 200 + 5x \)

**Second Venue:**
- Cost per guest: $25 (includes food)
- Total cost: \( 25x \)

We need to find the value of \( x \) where the total costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5x = 25x \]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20x \]

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's define the number of insects David found as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

To find \( D \), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more insects than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as follows:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"To determine the total cost for the snowshoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs.
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.

Each dog has 4 legs, and Mario has 6 dogs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ legs}}{2 \text{ legs per pair}} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost is:

2. **Calculate the number of days available:**
   - Andy's goal is to lose the weight by July 19th, and today is December 31st.
   - Counting the days from December 31st to July 19th:
     - December: 31 days (from December 31st to December 31st is 0 days)
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July 1st to July 19th: 19 days
   - Total days = 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 190 days

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   - To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
     \[
     \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 552.63 \text{ calories/day}
     \]

Therefore, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of approximately 553 calories to reach his goal. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{553}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000.
2. The house costs three times as much as the lot.

We can write these as equations:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ H = 3L \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now, using the second equation to find \( H \):
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is \(\boxed{90000}\)."

   \]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially. Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. The total amount is:
\[ 4 \times 10 + 6 \times 20 = 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount given to his sister is:
\[ \frac{160}{2} = 80 \]

After giving $80 to his sister, the remaining amount of money Ali has is:
\[ 160 - 80 = 80 \]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. The amount used for dinner is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48 \]

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

"To solve the problem, let's break down the strawberry-picking rates for each individual:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby picks \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy picks twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy picks \(5 \times 2 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum up the picking rates to find the total number of quarts picked per hour:

\[6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which one person can paint a house. If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, then it would take that person 10 days to paint a whole house. This means the rate for one person is:

\[ \text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} \]

If 5 people are working together, their combined rate would be:

\[ \text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1 \text{ house}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{5 \text{ houses}}{10 \text{ days}} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{2 \text{ days}} \]

This means that 5 people can paint a whole house in 2 days. To find out how many hours it would take, we need to convert days into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"

1. Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
2. At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   48 - 8 = 40
   \]
3. At the first stop, 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]
4. After the first stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:
   \[
   40 + 40 = 80
   \]
5. At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, the number of passengers left on the bus is:
   \[
   80 - 21 = 59
   \]
6. At the second stop, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers who get on the bus is:
   \[
   \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]
7. After the second stop, the number of passengers on the bus is:

"Given the scenario, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for a total of $2,400.
2. The computer costs $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the 2 monitors by subtracting the cost of the computer and the printer from the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost of 2 monitors} = \$2,400 - \$1,100 - \$700 = \$600 \]

To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the total cost of the 2 monitors by 2:

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book and then sum them up.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it is \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it is \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm.

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

First, add 31 and 50:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]

Next, add 45 to the result:
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]

Finally, add 62 to the result:
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."

"To solve the problem where Jeff and Brad are dividing 100 dollars with Jeff getting 4 times as much as Brad, we can set up an equation. Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Therefore, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's share as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets \(\boxed{80}\) dollars."

"Elise is practicing writing the alphabet. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, and then re-writes everything she has already written. Let's break down the steps:

1. Writing the alphabet in full twice:
   - The alphabet has 26 letters.
   - Writing it once: 26 letters.
   - Writing it twice: \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

2. Writing half of the alphabet once:
   - Half of the alphabet is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.
   - Writing half of it once: 13 letters.

3. Re-writing everything she has already written:
   - The total number of letters written so far is \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
   - Re-writing everything: 65 letters.

4. Calculating the total number of letters written:

"Mark was unwell for 3 months, during which he lost 10 pounds per month. If his final weight was 70 pounds, we can calculate his initial weight as follows:

1. Calculate the total weight lost:
   - Weight lost per month = 10 pounds
   - Duration of illness = 3 months
   - Total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

2. Calculate the initial weight:
   - Final weight = 70 pounds
   - Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has. We know that James's play set has 80 toys, and Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, the total number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set is:

\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have 400 toys. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. Then, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

Therefore, Jonathan currently has \(\boxed{398}\) toys."
"Daniel is an engineering student who wants to buy five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set from a school supply shop. The prices are as follows:
- Notebook: $1.50 each
- Pen: $0.25 each
- Calculator: $12 each
- Geometry set: $10 each

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items before the discount:
- Five notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator: \(1 \times 12 = 12.00\)
- One geometry set: \(1 \times 10 = 10.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12.00 + 10.00 = 30.00\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the purchased items. Therefore, we need to calculate the discount amount:
\[30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00\]

Therefore, the final amount Daniel has to spend is \(\boxed{27.00}\)."

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water, and then find the difference in time.

First, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water. In cold water, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. Therefore, twice this time is:
\[ 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding 2 minutes to this time gives:
\[ 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile in warm water.

Next, we calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in each condition.

For cold water:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

For warm water:
\[ 3 \times 34 = 102 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day:
\[ 102 - 48 = 54 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the first week and the second week.

In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, the total reading time for the first week is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can calculate her reading speed in pages per minute:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Using this reading speed, we can find out how many pages she read in the first week:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she read in two weeks is:

"To determine the temperature Maggie should set her oven to, we first need to understand the percentage error in her oven's temperature. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually reaches 468 degrees. The difference is 18 degrees, and the percentage error is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{468 - 450}{450} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
\]

This means the oven is 4% too hot. If the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature Maggie should set her oven to so that it ends up at 520 degrees after accounting for the 4% error. Let's denote the temperature Maggie should set as \( T \). The actual temperature the oven will reach is \( T \times 1.04 \) (since it is 4% too hot). We want this to be 520 degrees:

\[
T \times 1.04 = 520
\]

Solving for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500

"To determine the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to convert the duration of each movie into minutes and then sum them up.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting 2 hours into minutes gives:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding the 5 minutes gives:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the total time for both movies:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To determine the value of Juan's house, we start by calculating 30% of the price Herb paid for his house, which is $76,000.

1. Calculate 30% of $76,000:

"Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, and each box contains 90 contacts. The original price of one box is $100.00, but there is a 10% discount. The discount amount per box is $10.00, so the price per box after the discount is $90.00. Therefore, the total cost for 2 boxes is $180.00. Since each box contains 90 contacts, 2 boxes contain 180 contacts. The cost per contact is calculated by dividing the total cost by the total number of contacts, which is $180.00 / 180 = $1.00.

The cost per pair of contacts is \(\boxed{1.00}\)."
"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, let's break down the hours worked and calculate the earnings step by step.

First, we calculate the total hours worked by Jill:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours for Jill = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours worked by John:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours for John = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both:
- They are paid $10 per hour.
- Jill's earnings = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- John's earnings = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

Finally, we find the difference in earnings:
- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.

Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill.

The final answer is: \boxed{40}"
"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories she burns from her activities. 

- Aerobics: \(2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}\)
- Running: \(1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}\)

Adding these together gives the total calories burned:
\[1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}\]

Given that Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned, we can calculate the total amount of water she needs:
\[\frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}\]

Therefore, the amount of water Hannah needs to drink is \(\boxed{800 \, \text{ml}}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans. Therefore, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]
\[ 3B = 4500 \]
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the jar contains \(\boxed{30}\) more green jelly beans than red jelly beans."

"In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Let's denote the smallest angle as \(x\). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \(2x\), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \(3x\).

The equation for the sum of the angles in the triangle is:
\[x + 2x + 3x = 180\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180\]

Solving for \(x\), we divide both sides by 6:
\[x = \frac{180}{6} = 30\]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The other two angles are \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees and \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees. Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break it down into two parts: the cost for the first 5 months and the cost for the remaining 5 months.

1. **Cost for the first 5 months:**
   - Initial funding: $100,000 per month for 5 months.
   - Total cost for the first 5 months: \(100,000 \times 5 = 500,000\).

2. **Cost for the remaining 5 months:**
   - The research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so the remaining period is \(10 \times 5 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40\) months.
   - However, the problem states that the cost for each month after the first 5 months is 50% more than the initial funding per month.
   - The cost per month for the remaining 5 months is \(100,000 \times 1.5 = 150,000\).
   - Total cost for the remaining 5 months: \(150,000 \times 5 = 750,000\).

3. **Total cost calculation:**
   - Total cost: \(500,000 + 750,000 = 1,250,000\).

The total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1250000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to sum the amounts each player ate:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.

"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet.
2. Determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height.
3. Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the required height difference.

First, convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:
\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{40}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

Next, determine the height difference between the required height and Adam's current height:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Since Adam grows 2 inches per year, we need to convert this growth rate to feet:
\[ 2 \text{ inches/year} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} \]

Now, calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ years} \]

"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we start by understanding the total cost and the number of classes. The total cost for the Karate classes is $60, and there are 10 total classes.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss. Therefore, the number of classes he attends is \( 10 - x \).

The cost per class is given by:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x} \]

We need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss such that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the inequality by \( 10 - x \) (assuming \( 10 - x > 0 \)):
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - x) \]

Distribute the 10 on the right side:
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10x \]

Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 100 from both sides:
\[ 60 - 100 \leq -10x \]
\[ -40 \leq -10x \]

Divide both sides by -10, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:
\[ 4 \geq x \]
\[ x \leq 4 \]

Therefore, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required for each segment of the digging process separately and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time required to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
- The time to dig through the soil is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time required to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at a rate of half his soil digging rate through clay, which is \( \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \).
- He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
- The time to dig through the clay is given by the total distance divided by the rate: \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Finally, we sum the time required for both the soil and the clay:
- Total time = time through soil + time through clay = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is \(\boxed{10}\) hours."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, keeping in mind the context of an expert in history.

1. **Determine the earnings from green hats in the first month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400.
   - The sales from red hats were half the total amount she earned from green hats.
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in the first month were \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total earnings in the first month:**
   - Total earnings in the first month = Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats
   - Total earnings in the first month = \(400 + 800 = 1200\) dollars.

3. **Determine the earnings in the second month:**
   - The sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales in the first month.
   - Therefore, the sales in the second month = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total earnings over the two months:**
   - Total earnings over two months = Earnings in the first month + Earnings in the second month
   - Total earnings over two months = \(1200 + 900 = 2100\) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the number of heads and legs of the animals on Lee's farm. Let's define the variables:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep.
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the problem, we know:
1. Sheep have 1 head and 4 legs.
2. Geese have 1 head and 2 legs.
3. The total number of heads is 20.
4. The total number of legs is 70.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

To simplify the second equation, we can divide everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
\[ \begin{cases} 
S + G = 20 \\
2S + G = 35 
\end{cases} \]

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep is \( S = 15 \).

To find the number of geese, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Thus, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - There are 8 more dogs, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - James needs to buy 8 more toys to have enough for all 12 dogs.

2. **After Buying the Toys:**
   - James now has \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys for 12 dogs.
   - The number of dogs then doubles, so the new number of dogs is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - James needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys to have enough for the 24 dogs.

3. **After the Second Purchase:**
   - James now has \(12 + 12 = 24\) toys for 24 dogs.
   - 3 dogs leave the shelter, so the number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).
   - James no longer needs the toys for the 3 dogs that left, so he no longer needs to buy any more toys.

**Total Number of Toys Needed:**
- Initially, James needed 8 toys.
- Then, he needed 12 more toys.
- No additional toys were needed after that.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

"Given the problem, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. Katarina has 68 cookies.
2. Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Max has \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.
3. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has \(73 - 12 = 61\) cookies.
4. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has \(73 + 23 = 96\) cookies.

Now, let's sum up the total number of cookies:

- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the historical context of measurements and proportions.

Shania is extending her dress by 50% of its original length and then adding an additional 20 cm with a lace trim. The final length of the dress is 140 cm. Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

The equation representing the final length of the dress can be written as:
\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Chris to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode.

First, let's find the mowing rates for both modes:
- In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes). Therefore, his mowing rate in ""turtle"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}}\).
- In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his mowing rate in ""rabbit"" mode is \(\frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}}\).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in each mode:
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}\).
- Time to mow half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode: \(\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn} \div \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}\).

Finally, we add the times together to find the total time it took Chris to mow the entire lawn:
\[30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( T \) be the age of one of the triplets. Since there is one set of twins and one set of triplets, and one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, we can express the age of one of the twins as \( T + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twin and the triplet are given as 44. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (T + 7) + T = 44 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 2T + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2T = 37 \]
\[ T = 18.5 \]

Now, we can find the age of one of the twins:
\[ T + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of one candy. We know that four candies cost $3.20. Therefore, the cost of one candy is:
\[ \frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80 \]
So, each candy costs $0.80.

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, the cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
So, 10 lollipops cost $4.00.

Now, we calculate the cost of 10 candies. Since each candy costs $0.80, the cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8.00 \]
So, 10 candies cost $8.00.

Finally, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies to find the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by Rong and Neil over a period of ten years.

First, let's determine Neil's monthly savings. Rong saves 20 coins per month, and Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong. Therefore, Neil's monthly savings are:

\[ 20 + 20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of coins saved by each person over ten years. Since there are 12 months in a year, over ten years, there are:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

Rong's total savings over ten years are:

\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil's total savings over ten years are:

\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil:

\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the total number of coins they have saved together is:

   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - The dog needs 2 vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

2. Let the total bill be \(x\) dollars. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, the cost of the heartworm check is \(0.6x\).

3. The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[
   x = 40 + 0.6x
   \]

4. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4x = 40
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100

"To determine Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount, we first need to calculate the cost of each item he ordered:

- Croissants: \(5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00\)
- Cinnamon rolls: \(4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00\)
- Mini quiches: \(3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00\)
- Blueberry muffins: \(13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:
\[
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
\]

Applying the 10% discount means Marcus pays 90% of the total:

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Erin can take advantage of the ice cream parlor's deal, which is buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. To determine how many scoops she can get with $6.00, we first calculate the cost for 3 scoops (2 bought + 1 free):

\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50/\text{scoop} = \$3.00 \]

This means for every $3.00, she gets 3 scoops. With $6.00, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops:

\[ \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00/\text{set}} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set gives her 3 scoops, 2 sets will give her:

\[ 2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the number of scoops Erin can get with $6.00 is:

"To determine how much more candy Amy has after two weeks, we need to calculate the total amount of candy each person eats in that period and then find the difference.

Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and there are 14 days in two weeks. Therefore, Ginger eats:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Amy eats 3 pieces a day, and there are 14 days in two weeks. Therefore, Amy eats:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Initially, both Ginger and Amy start with 100 pieces of candy. After two weeks, Ginger has:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And Amy has:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

The difference in the amount of candy between Amy and Ginger is:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and then find the average of these times.

First, we know that the cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages. The dog, on the other hand, can eat the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes. Therefore, the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. The average time is the sum of the times divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"Certainly! Let's approach this problem step-by-step using historical reasoning and mathematical principles.

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe into inches. Topher's shoe is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert 8 feet to inches as follows:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Adding the additional 4 inches, we get:

\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let's denote the length of Bobby's shoe as \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Then, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."

- Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of windows smashed for the teachers' cars:
- There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

The total number of windows in teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Since Hannah smashes three-quarters of these windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Finally, we sum the windows smashed for both students' and teachers' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ windows} + 48 \text{ windows} = 112 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"

"In a certain school, two classes have a total of 80 students. Each class has the same amount of students, and in each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students is 80 and there are two classes, each class has:
     \[
     \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls in each class:**
   - Given that 40% of the students in each class are girls, the number of girls in each class is:
     \[
     0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   - The total number of students in each class is 40, and since there are 16 girls, the number of boys is:
     \[
     40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys}
     \]

"Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which amounts to \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers. Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which is \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers. Each large sticker is worth a large button, so she gets 20 large buttons.

She has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers left, and each large sticker is worth three small buttons. Therefore, she gets \(20 \times 3 = 60\) small buttons from the remaining large stickers.

Adding all the buttons together, she has 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the total number of council members is 33. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, which can be expressed as \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which equals 33. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Since the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \), we substitute \( x = 11 \) into the expression:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \(\boxed{22}\)."

"In the context of the question provided, it seems there is a misunderstanding as the scenario described does not align with historical analysis or expert knowledge in history. The question appears to be a mathematical problem rather than a historical one. However, if we were to interpret this in a historical context, we might consider the points as representing some form of historical achievement or score in a competition.

Given the points system:
- 10 points for each enemy jumped on
- 5 points for each berry collected
- 30 points for each second left on the timer

The difference in scores can be calculated as follows:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, which adds \(8 \times 10 = 80\) points.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, which adds \(3 \times 5 = 15\) points.
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, which subtracts \(4 \times 30 = 120\) points.

So, the net difference in points is:
\[ 80 + 15 - 120 = 215 - 215 = 0 \]

However, since the question asks for the difference between their scores, and based on the provided points system, the correct difference is:
\[ \boxed{215} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the remaining two pizzas after accounting for the cost of the two pizzas that are already known.

2. The cost of two of the pizzas is $30.
3. Therefore, the combined cost of the other two pizzas is:
   \[
   64 - 30 = 34
   \]
4. Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
   \[
   34 \div 2 = 17
   \]

Thus, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which totals:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying more fish, he ended up with twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's denote the number of orange fish he bought as \(O\) and the number of white fish he bought as \(W\).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total number of fish he bought is 17, so \(O + W = 17\).
2. After adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is \(3 + O\) and the number of white fish is \(4 + W\). According to the problem, \(3 + O = 2(4 + W)\).

Let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[3 + O = 8 + 2W\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \(O + W = 17\)
2. \(O - 2W = 5\)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method. First, we can multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \(W\):
\[2O + 2W = 34\]
\[O - 2W = 5\]

Now, add these two equations together to eliminate \(W\):
\[2O + 2W + O - 2W = 34 + 5\]
\[3O = 39\]
\[O = 13\]

Now substitute \(O = 13\) back into the first equation:
\[13 + W = 17\]
\[W = 4\]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. The correct answer is:
\[\boxed{4}\]"

"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months.
2. Determine the total number of employees after three months.
3. Calculate the total salary expense for all employees for three months.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of new employees hired over three months.**

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Over three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of employees after three months.**

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees is:

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, which means he needed to order more to meet the demand. He then ordered an additional 100 candies.

To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his second order:
   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (second order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

2. Subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
   \[
   200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Given the scenario where the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, we can calculate the number of students at the end of each month as follows:

- **End of January**: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February**: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March**: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April**: \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May**: \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

To find the number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial number of students, we subtract the initial number of students from the number of students at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students that joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week to find the average number of branches climbed per day.

First, we know that Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. During the week, he made $105. To find the total number of branches he climbed, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \text{ branches}
\]

Next, we need to find the average number of branches he climbed per day. There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:

\[
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \text{ branches per day}
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Flowers and Petals:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

2. **Total Petals Before Dropping:**
   - Summing up all the petals: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

3. **Dropping 1 of Each Type of Flower:**
   - She drops 1 flower of each type, so she loses:
     - 1 flower with 5 petals: \(5\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 6 petals: \(6\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 4 petals: \(4\) petals.
     - 1 flower with 7 petals: \(7\) petals.
   - Total petals lost: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

4. **Remaining Petals in the Vase:**
   - Subtract the lost petals from the total: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{79}

"Given the scenario, we need to determine how many S'mores each person can have after accounting for the marshmallows used and those dropped on the ground.

Initially, there are 35 marshmallows. John and DeSean each make 9 S'mores, which totals:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they use 18 marshmallows. Additionally, they drop 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows lost is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Subtracting the lost marshmallows from the initial amount, we get:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

These 14 marshmallows can be used to make 14 S'mores. Since John and DeSean are sharing these S'mores equally, each person can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the context of an expert in history.

1. **Determine the playing times for each person:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter.
   - Two friends can play for half as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \div 2 = 10\) minutes per quarter.
   - One friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they can play for \(20 \times 1.5 = 30\) minutes per quarter.

2. **Calculate the total playing time for each person in 4 hours:**
   - 4 hours is equal to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - Jack can play for \(240 \div 20 = 12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends can play for \(240 \div 10 = 24\) quarters.
   - The better friend can play for \(240 \div 30 = 8\) quarters.

3. **Calculate the total number of quarters used:**
   - Jack uses \(12\) quarters.
   - Each of the two friends uses \(24\) quarters, so together they use \(24 \times 2 = 48\) quarters.
   - The better friend uses \(8\) quarters.
   - The total number of quarters used is \(12 + 48 + 8 = 68\).

4. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Since each quarter costs $0.25, the total cost is \(68 \times 0.25 = 17\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables for the quantities of each ingredient:
- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
- Since the amount of citrus zest is the same as the amount of fragrance, the amount of fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt in ounces.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar, the amount of sugar is also \( s \) ounces.
- The amount of oil is \( 2s \) ounces (twice as much as salt).

The total amount of the salt scrub is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ z + z + s + s + 2s = 10 \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2z + 4s = 10 \]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[ z + 2s = 5 \]

We need to find the value of \( 2s \), which is the amount of oil. From the equation \( z + 2s = 5 \), we can express \( z \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ z = 5 - 2s \]

Since \( z \) and \( s \) are both positive quantities and must be such that the total is 10 ounces, we can choose a value for \( s \) that makes \( z \) a positive number. For example, if \( s = 1 \), then \( z = 5 - 2 \cdot 1 = 3 \). This satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the amount of oil is:
\[ 2s = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]

So, the amount of oil Tanya uses is \(\boxed{2}\) ounces."
"To determine how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows he purchased.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John bought 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the goats is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John bought 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.
- Therefore, the total cost for the cows is \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the overall amount spent:
- Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
- Total cost = \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars.

So, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of cards PJ has as \(P\). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \(3P\) cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has \(3P + 12\) cards. The total number of cards is 341, so we can write the equation:

\[P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[7P + 12 = 341\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[7P = 329\]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[P = 47\]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, we can find out how many cards Smendrick and Becca have. Smendrick has:

\[3P = 3 \times 47 = 141\]

   12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. For the second glue stick, which has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   The unused length of the second glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. For the third glue stick, which has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left, the unused portion is:
   \[
   1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   The unused length of the third glue stick is:
   \[
   12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we sum the unused lengths of all three glue sticks:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ millimeters}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000 and a phone for $800. He has $5,000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help. To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we first calculate the total cost of the car and the phone:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10,000 + \$800 = \$10,800 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has:

\[ \text{Money from working} = \$5,000 \]
\[ \text{Money from brother} = \$200 \]
\[ \text{Total money Gabriel has} = \$5,000 + \$200 = \$5,200 \]

Now, we find out how much more money Gabriel needs by subtracting the total money he has from the total cost:

\[ \text{Money still needed} = \$10,800 - \$5,200 = \$5,600 \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs \(\$5,600\)."

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine how much money Craig initially has. Since he has 2 twenty-dollar bills, the total amount is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the six squirt guns. Each squirt gun costs $2, so the total cost for the squirt guns is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the three packs of water balloons. Each pack costs $3, so the total cost for the water balloons is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons to find the total amount spent:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig had:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Given the problem, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. Jack collected 60 dishes.
2. Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:

- Jack's socks: 30
- Jack's dishes: 60
- Peter's socks: 60
- Peter's dishes: 30

Total number of socks and dishes = Jack's socks + Jack's dishes + Peter's socks + Peter's dishes
= 30 + 60 + 60 + 30
= 180

The total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"To determine how many students are good at math in Miss Susan's class, we can break down the information given:

- Total number of students: 20
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English. This can be found by subtracting the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at English only}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, we find the total number of students who are good at math by adding those who are good at math only and those who are good at both:

\[ \text{Total students good at math} = \text{Students good at math only} + \text{Students good at both} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given the constraints of the concert schedule, we need to determine how many musical groups can perform within a 2-hour timeframe, accounting for the time each group requires on stage and the intermission.

Each group needs:
- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

This totals to 10 minutes per group.

The concert duration is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. We also have a 10-minute intermission.

Subtracting the intermission from the total time gives us:
120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes available for the groups.

Dividing the available time by the time each group needs:
110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
11"
"To determine how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and add it to the original investment.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Here, the principal (P) is $300, the rate (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, and the time (T) is 3 years.

First, we calculate the annual interest rate:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Next, we calculate the total interest over 3 years:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 225 \times 3 = 300 \times 675 = 202500 \div 1000 = 202.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the original principal to find the total amount after 3 years:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} = 300 + 202.50 = 502.50 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{502.50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **White Shirts with Collars:**
   - The store has 40 white shirts.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, the number of white shirts with collars is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

2. **White Shirts without Collars:**
   - Since there are 40 white shirts in total and 20 of them have collars, the number of white shirts without collars is \( 40 - 20 = 20 \).

3. **Floral Shirts with Buttons:**
   - The store has 50 floral shirts.
   - 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.

4. **Floral Shirts without Buttons:**
   - Since there are 50 floral shirts in total and 20 of them have buttons, the number of floral shirts without buttons is \( 50 - 20 = 30 \).

5. **Difference between Floral Shirts without Buttons and White Shirts without Collars:**
   - The number of floral shirts without buttons is 30.
   - The number of white shirts without collars is 20.
   - The difference is \( 30 - 20 = 10 \).

"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and relationships step by step:

1. Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
2. Let \( Q \) be the age of the person asking the question (you).
3. Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
- You are three years younger than your brother: \( Q = B - 3 \).
- You are two years older than your sister: \( Q = S + 2 \).
- Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( \text{Mom's age} = 3B - 1 \).
- The sum of all your ages is 87: \( Q + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

First, express \( S \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ S = Q - 2 \]

Next, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now, substitute \( Q = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the total age equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, find \( Q \):
\[ Q = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are \(\boxed{13}\) years old."

- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is \(50 \times 10 = 500\).

Next, add the number of burritos Mr. George ate:
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
- Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed is \(500 + 20 = 520\).

Finally, subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the initial number of burritos ordered:
- The initial number of burritos ordered is 600.
- The total number of burritos consumed is 520.
- Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos is \(600 - 520 = 80\).

The total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, let's break down the information step by step:

1. There are 12 red cars.
2. The number of green cars is 2 fewer than the number of red cars, so there are \(12 - 2 = 10\) green cars.
3. The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, so there are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) blue cars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars:

\[12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. Therefore, the number of yellow cars can be found by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of books each person has using variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.
- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S + A + F = 85 \) (Together, they have 85 books)
2. \( S = A + 25 \) (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
3. \( A = F - 12 \) (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. First, express \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- From \( A = F - 12 \)
- From \( S = A + 25 \), substitute \( A \) to get \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \)

Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation:
\[ (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \]
\[ 3F + 1 = 85 \]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books."

"To determine how much Isaias bought the chickens for, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling these chickens.
3. Use the profit to find the total cost of the chickens.

First, calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:
\[ \text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000 \]

Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000, so the total cost of the chickens he took to the market is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for is:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Glasses Sold**: Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade.
2. **Julie's Sales**: Julie sold 14 glasses.
3. **Boys' Sales**: The remaining glasses were sold by Micah and Mitchell, who sold an equal number of glasses. Therefore, the number of glasses sold by the boys together is:
   \[
   32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses}
   \]
4. **Individual Sales by Boys**: Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, each of them sold:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses}
   \]
5. **Difference in Sales**: To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract Micah's sales from Julie's sales:
   \[
   14 - 9 = 5
   \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final answer is:

"Given the problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales. We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Let's break down the information provided:

1. Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn.
2. Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she mowed Joe's lawn.
3. Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn.

Let's define the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn as \( J \). Then:
- The number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn is \( 3J \).
- The number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn is \( 5J \).

Since Joe paid Tasha $6 for each time she mowed his lawn, the total amount Tasha earned from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6J + 6(3J) + 6(5J) = 6J + 18J + 30J = 54J \]

We know that Tasha made a total of $80 from both activities, so:
\[ 54J + \text{(amount from lemonade sales)} = 80 \]

Let \( L \) be the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. Then:
\[ 54J + L = 80 \]
\[ L = 80 - 54J \]

To find a feasible value for \( J \), we need \( L \) to be a non-negative amount. The smallest integer value for \( J \) that keeps \( L \) non-negative is \( J = 1 \):

"To determine how many tune-ups Jon's car needs, we first calculate the total miles driven in a 30-day month. Given that Jon drives 100 miles a day, the total miles driven in 30 days is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since Jon's car requires a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles driven by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups needed:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of the cake**: $11
2. **Cost of the balloons**: Since 1 dozen balloons (12 balloons) cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} \times 0.5 = 6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the ice cream**: 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each cost:
   \[
   2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

This means Julia and Nadine had a total of $28 combined. Since they had the same amount of allowance, we divide the total by 2 to find out how much each received:
\[
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them \(\boxed{14}\) dollars."

"To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total number of lollipops sold = \(30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}\).

2. **Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   - The selling price of each lollypop is $0.8.
   - Total revenue = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 240 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   - The cost price of each lollypop is $0.5.
   - Total cost = \(300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollypop} = 150 \text{ dollars}\).

4. **Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:**
   - Profit = \(240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, let's break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(7 \times 3 = 21\) fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
2. Determine how many berries are picked per trip based on the total number of berries and the number of trips.

Each trip (down the tree and back up) takes 4 hours. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth can make:
\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 2 trips, then the number of berries per trip is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total calories from both the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins.

First, let's calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, so each mini cinnamon roll has \( 600 \times \frac{1}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, so each mini blueberry muffin has \( 450 \times \frac{1}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins, so the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Now, let's add the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories
- Total calories from all pastries: \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is 85000."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the week and then divide by the number of days.

- **Monday**: 39 Junebugs
- **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Wednesday**: Twice as many as Monday, so \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs
- **Friday**: 57 Junebugs

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total by the number of days (5 days from Monday to Friday):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is:

"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle covered.

For the bus:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours = 300 miles

For the car:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours = 240 miles

Now, we find the difference in distance:
- Difference = Distance traveled by bus - Distance traveled by car = 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car."

"Given the problem, we need to determine Peter's age based on the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean, which is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( Pa \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the information provided, we can write the following equations:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substituting \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtracting 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Dividing by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Peter's age is:
\[
\boxed{50}

   - Commission rate: 10%
   - Price per copy: $5
   - Number of copies sold: 6
   - Commission per copy: \( 5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \) dollars
   - Total commission from New York Times: \( 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \) dollars

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Commission rate: 8%
   - Price per copy: $15
   - Number of copies sold: 10
   - Commission per copy: \( 15 \times 0.08 = 1.20 \) dollars
   - Total commission from Wall Street Journal: \( 10 \times 1.20 = 12 \) dollars

3. **Total Commission:**
   - Total commission: \( 3 + 12 = 15 \) dollars

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Given the information that Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can determine Marcus's age first.

Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21

Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, we can find Leo's age by doubling Marcus's age.

Leo's age = 2 × 21 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old."
"Given the problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored. Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. The total points scored by the team is 45.
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo.
3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar.

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

First, we express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ A = B - 20 \]
\[ D = B - 10 \]

Substitute these expressions into the total points equation:
\[ B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45 \]
\[ B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3B - 30 = 45 \]
\[ 3B = 75 \]
\[ B = 25 \]

Now, we find \( A \):
\[ A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5 \]

Therefore, Azibo scored \(\boxed{5}\) points."
"Given the information that 100 pages of paper stack to 1 inch and the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book as follows:

1. First, determine the total number of pages in 1.5 inches of paper:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ inches} \times 100 \text{ pages per inch} = 150 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. Since each sheet of paper is printed on both sides, each sheet contributes 2 pages to the book. Therefore, to find the total number of pages in the book, we divide the total number of pages by 2:
   \[
   \frac{150 \text{ pages}}{2} = 75 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, the book has \(\boxed{75}\) pages."
"To determine how many reports Vince stapled, we first need to calculate the total time he spent stapling. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes, we divide:
\[ 900 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 60 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is \(\boxed{1800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate her total sleep duration, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The time from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is 8 hours.
   - Convert 8 hours to minutes: \(8 \times 60 = 480\) minutes.

2. **Determine the actual wake-up time:**
   - Kim usually wakes up at 6 a.m., but this day she woke up 5 minutes earlier.
   - Therefore, she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

3. **Calculate the time Kim was awake before getting out of bed:**
   - She woke up at 5:55 a.m. and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The time from 2:15 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 3 hours and 40 minutes.
   - Convert 3 hours and 40 minutes to minutes: \(3 \times 60 + 40 = 220\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time Kim was asleep but sleepwalking:**
   - She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is 23 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Kim was awake:**
   - Time awake before getting out of bed: 220 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Total time awake: \(220 + 23 = 243\) minutes

6. **Calculate the total time Kim was asleep:**
   - Usual sleep duration: 480 minutes
   - Subtract the total time awake: \(480 - 243 = 237\) minutes

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for \(\boxed{237}\) minutes that day."
"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Given that he has two dozen (24) measuring cups, we can calculate the number of measuring spoons as follows:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \text{ measuring spoons} \]

Adding the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons, we get:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Occupancy:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Number of initially occupied beds = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \) beds.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds initially = \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.

2. **Daily Admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted each day.
   - Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new admissions = \( 50 \times 14 = 700 \) patients.

3. **Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - Initially, 200 beds are occupied.
   - After 2 weeks, 700 more beds are occupied.
   - Total occupied beds = \( 200 + 700 = 900 \) beds.

4. **Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks:**
   - The hospital's total capacity is 1000 beds.
   - Total unoccupied beds = \( 1000 - 900 = 100 \) beds.

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is **100**."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Robyn sends a total of 16 emails a day.
2. Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. The remaining emails are \(16 - 7 = 9\).
4. Two-thirds of these 9 non-work emails are sent to family, which is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\).
5. Therefore, the remaining emails, which are not sent to family, are \(9 - 6 = 3\).
6. One-third of these remaining 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1\).

So, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the information, we can determine the ages step by step.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. Therefore, we calculate Shawna's father's age as:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

\[
\boxed{45}

"Given that Courtney reported 48 people attended the concert and Kelly stated that this number was 20% higher than the actual number, we can determine the actual number of attendees by reversing the 20% increase.

Let \( x \) be the actual number of people who attended the concert. According to Kelly, Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number. This can be expressed as:
\[ 1.2x = 48 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.2} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is 40."
"The problem presented involves a scenario where Coach distributed basketballs among three boys—Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey—during practice. The key information is that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, and Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason. We are also given that if Jason had carried 2 balls, we need to determine the total number of balls initially brought to practice.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem:
- Jason carried \( 2J \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 2 \times 2J = 4J \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ J + 2J + 4J = 7J \]

We are told that if Jason had carried 2 balls, then \( 2J = 2 \). Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Substituting \( J = 1 \) back into the total number of balls:
\[ 7J = 7 \times 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

4. **Fourth Day**: We know that by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. Since they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is the difference between the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day and the number of holes at the end of the third day:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

Thus, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
2. Therefore, the total number of corn chips received by Amora and Lainey together is:
   \[
   70 + 70 = 140
   \]
3. Collins received 15 more corn chips than each of Amora and Lainey, which means Collins received:
   \[
   70 + 15 = 85
   \]
4. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins:
   \[
   70 + 70 + 85 = 225
   \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[
\boxed{225}

"To determine the total cost of Jen's travel, we need to calculate the cost of the tickets, which is 50% more than the $400 he spends on supplies.

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the original $400 to find the total cost of the tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \).

According to the problem, Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \( 4A - 13 \).

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so the number of Pokemon caught by Alex is \( (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 \).

Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing both sides by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

Now, we need to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught. Since Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, we substitute \( A = 40 \) into the expression:
\[ 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, the number of Pokemon caught by Stan is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"John is watching a new show where each episode is 20 minutes long. The total number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode. Therefore, the number of episodes is:

\[

\]

To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
20 \times 10 = 200
\]

So, the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show is:

\[
\boxed{200}

"The bird's journey can be broken down into three segments:

1. **First Segment:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 10 hours
   - Speed: 30 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Direction: North
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Speed: 18 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Direction: South
   - Time: 5 hours
   - Speed: 22 miles per hour
   - Distance: \(5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}\)

To find the net distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we sum the distances flown in the southward direction and subtract the distance flown in the northward direction:

- Total distance flown south: \(300 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 410 \text{ miles}\)
- Total distance flown north: \(36 \text{ miles}\)

Net distance: \(410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}\)

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{374}\) miles."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Greta initially made 1 dozen brownies, which is 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she received an additional 1/2 dozen brownies, which is 6 brownies.
3. When she got home, she had 4 dozen brownies from her friends, which is 48 brownies.
4. During the surprise party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had before the surprise party:
\[ 12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office party)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

Next, we subtract the number of brownies eaten during the surprise party:
\[ 66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the final number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[ 48 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, making his brother 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 75% of Nani's age, so she is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) years old. The total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is \(8 + 16 + 6 = 30\).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."
"To determine the total time Andy will take to restring all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of string and then sum them up.

1. For the 3 racquets strung with synthetic gut:
   \(3 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}\)

2. For the 5 racquets strung with polyester string:
   \(5 \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes}\)

3. For the 4 racquets strung with a hybrid set:
   \(4 \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}\)

Adding these times together:
\(45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the total time Andy will take to restring all the racquets is 227 minutes."
"John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which totals 4 phones. The price of each phone is $600. The first two phones are at full price, so the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 600 = 1200 \]

The remaining two phones are at half price, so each of these phones costs:
\[ \frac{600}{2} = 300 \]

The cost for the last two phones is:
\[ 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

Adding the cost of all four phones together, we get:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is:

"To determine the number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2:

\[ \text{Number of slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges.
2. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes given away.
3. Subtracting the given boxes from the total, she has \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes left.
4. She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining 8 boxes, which is \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) boxes.
5. Therefore, the number of boxes she sold is \(8 - 2 = 6\) boxes.

"The United States of America has 50 states. According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Half of the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \). Adding 4 to this gives the number of states in India as \( 25 + 4 = 29 \).

To find the total number of states in both countries together, we add the number of states in the USA and India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the amount needed by his hourly wage:

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the price of the red car as follows:

1. Calculate 40% of the blue car's price: \(40\% \times 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40\)
2. Subtract this amount from the blue car's price to find the red car's price: \(100 - 40 = 60\)

So, the red car costs $60.

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the blue car and the red car together:

\[100 + 60 = 160\]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"Given the information:

- Emil is currently 19 years old.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years from now.
- At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
- At that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.

To find their current ages:
- Emil's dad will be 48 in 5 years, so his current age is \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
- Emil's brother will be 12 in 5 years, so his current age is \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

The sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and brother is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:

After accounting for the football players, we have:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students} \]

Out of these remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. We calculate this as:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students} \]

Adding the football players, cheerleaders, and band members, we get the total number of students leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the size of Sophie's boots, which is given as size 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we calculate Charlie's boot size as follows:

\[ \text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Next, we find the average size of the boots worn by Charlie and Sophie. The formula for the average is the sum of the sizes divided by 2:

\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}}{2} = \frac{25 + 5}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of shoe worn by the two is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total space required for each plant, including the space between them. Each plant grows 12 inches wide, which is 1 foot, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space required for each plant is:

\[1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}\]

Next, we need to determine how many plants can fit into the 111 feet long flower bed. We do this by dividing the length of the flower bed by the total space required for each plant:

\[ \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can only have a whole number of plants, we take the integer part of the division, which is 44 plants. Pat already owns 17 flowers, so the number of additional flowers she needs to buy is:

\[44 - 17 = 27\]

Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

\[27 \text{ plants} \times 6 \text{ dollars/plant} = 162 \text{ dollars}\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}

"To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the peeling and sautéing processes separately and then combine the times.

1. **Peeling Shrimp**:
   - Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
   - To peel 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Sautéing Shrimp**:
   - Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.
   - To sauté 90 shrimp, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since both tasks need to be completed sequentially, we add the times together:
\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net temperature change over the given time periods.

1. **Low setting for 3 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 3 hours, the room cools by \(3 \times 2 = 6\) degrees.

2. **High setting for 4 hours:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room at a rate of 3 degrees per hour.
   - After 4 hours, the room cools by \(4 \times 3 = 12\) degrees.

3. **No air conditioner for 2 hours:**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - After 2 hours, the room warms up by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.
- Final warming: \(-4\) degrees.

The net change in temperature is \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

"Comet Halley has a known orbital period of 75 years. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age at that time. Therefore, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time. Since the comet appears every 75 years, the time between the two sightings is 75 years. Thus, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, let's break down the frequency of each type of check:

1. **Electric bill**: Buford writes one check per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, he writes:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

2. **Gas bill**: Similarly, he writes one check per month for the gas bill, which totals:
   \[
   12 \text{ checks}
   \]

3. **Church**: He writes two checks per month to the church. Over the course of a year, this amounts to:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}
   \]

4. **Pest and lawn service**: He writes one check every quarter to the pest and lawn service. Since there are 4 quarters in a year, this results in:

"The problem involves understanding the flight patterns of two planes at an airport. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total flights of the first plane:**
   - The second plane makes 44 trips.
   - These 44 trips are half the number of trips made by the first plane.
   - Therefore, the first plane makes \( 44 \times 2 = 88 \) trips in one day.

2. **Determine the distribution of the first plane's flights:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - This means \( \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \) flights are to Greece.
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
   - The remaining flights are \( 88 - 66 = 22 \).
   - Since these 22 flights are split equally, the number of flights to France is \( \frac{22}{2} = 11 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"Given the information, we need to determine the age of Wilfred among the four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know the following:

1. Akbar is 3 years old.
2. Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. The total age of the children is 20.
4. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.

First, let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- Akbar's age \(A = 3\)
- Alessandro's age \(B = 4\)
- Helene's age \(H\)
- Wilfred's age \(W\)

The total age of the children is given by:
\[ A + B + H + W = 20 \]

Substituting the known values of \(A\) and \(B\):
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

Next, we use the information that Helene's age is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[ \frac{A + B + H + W}{4} \]

Since \(A + B + H + W = 20\), the average age is:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, Helene's age \(H\) is:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, substituting \(H = 10\) into the equation \(H + W = 13\):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Thus, the age of Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"In the scenario where a family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) is to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, we can determine the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets as follows:

Let the size of each kid's slice be \(x\). Therefore, each adult's slice is \(2x\).

The total number of slices is \(2 \times 2x + 4 \times x = 4x + 4x = 8x\).

The total size of the watermelon is \(8x\).

Each adult gets \(2x\) of the watermelon. To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of the watermelon}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{2x}{8x}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100 = 25\%

\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we calculate the values of \( (0.91)^5 \) and \( (0.93)^3 \):
\[ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.624032 \]
\[ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357 \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x \times 0.624032 \times 0.804357 = 0.28 \]
\[ x \times 0.501872 = 0.28 \]
\[ x = \frac{0.28}{0.501872} \approx 0.5578 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park is approximately 56%.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{56\%}\)."
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment for a $10,000 car, we first calculate her total weekly earnings. Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips, making her total hourly earnings $25. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$1,000 \text{ per week} \]

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car for a down payment. The down payment amount is:

\[ 0.20 \times \$10,000 = \$2,000 \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000/\text{week}} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment.

\[
\boxed{2}

"Jamaar has $10 to spend on fresh fruits. The prices are as follows: peaches and pears are $0.50 each, apples are $0.75 each, kiwis are $1.00 each, and plums are $0.25 each. He has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples. Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already bought:

- Cost of 3 peaches: \(3 \times 0.50 = 1.50\) dollars
- Cost of 4 pears: \(4 \times 0.50 = 2.00\) dollars
- Cost of 2 kiwis: \(2 \times 1.00 = 2.00\) dollars
- Cost of 5 apples: \(5 \times 0.75 = 3.75\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost so far:
\[1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25\] dollars

Jamaar started with $10, so the remaining amount he has is:
\[10 - 9.25 = 0.75\] dollars

The cost of one plum is $0.25. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
\[0.75 \div 0.25 = 3\]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy \(\boxed{3}\) plums."

   \]

Therefore, each of Anne's friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \]

where:
- \( P \) is the final price,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price,
- \( r \) is the annual increase rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars,
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% as a decimal),
- \( n = 3 \) years.

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply by the initial price:

\[ P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Initially, the hotel has 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected for an early checkout, reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, further reducing the number of guests to:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Adding these 30 guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the price of each type of stuffed animal:**
   - The price of a small stuffed animal is given as $4.
   - The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

2. **Define the number of stuffed animals sold:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
   - Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - The total earnings from selling large stuffed animals is \( 12x \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from selling small stuffed animals is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \) dollars.
   - The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is \( 12x + 8x = 20x \) dollars.

4. **Set up the equation based on the total earnings:**
   - We know the total earnings are $120, so we set up the equation \( 20x = 120 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \).

6. **Determine the number of small stuffed animals sold:**

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ore mining capacity of 40 dwarves using steel pickaxes over a period of 30 days.

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
   - With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
   - With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is \(24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day:**
   - Each dwarf mines 36 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, 40 dwarves can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in 30 days:**

"To determine the amount of fabric Jim needs, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces required. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet, and each fabric piece needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each fabric piece is:
\[ 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each fabric piece is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one fabric piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total square footage of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"To determine the average loss per race, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **First Race:**
   - Loss: $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   - Win: $1 more than twice the amount lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
   - Win: \(10 + 1 = 11\).

3. **Third Race:**
   - Loss: 1.5 times the amount won in the second race.
   - Loss: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\).

Now, let's calculate the total loss and total win:

- Total loss: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\).
- Total win: \(11\).

Net result:
- Net loss: \(21.5 - 11 = 10.5\).

To find the average loss per race, we divide the total net loss by the number of races (3):

\[
\text{Average loss per race} = \frac{10.5}{3} = 3.5
\]

Thus, the average loss per race is \(\boxed{3.5}\)."
"To determine the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Xavier's original height from feet to inches.
2. Calculate Xavier's current height after growing 3 inches.
3. Calculate Cole's current height after growing 2 inches.
4. Find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights.

Let's start with Xavier:
- Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, his original height in inches is:
  \[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]
- After growing 3 inches, his current height is:
  \[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Now, let's calculate Cole's current height:
- Cole was originally 50 inches tall. After growing 2 inches, his current height is:
  \[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, we find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the share of the first person as \(x\).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \(x + 80\).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which is \(2(x + 80)\).

The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920\]
\[4x + 240 = 1920\]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[4x = 1680\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = 420\]

So, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\)."
"To determine the total hours of work each painter put in, let's break down the problem:

1. **Convert the daily work time into hours:**
   - A full day has 24 hours.
   - They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - Therefore, the hours worked per day by the team is \( 24 \times \frac{3}{8} = 9 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, 3 weeks have \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - The total hours worked by the team over 21 days is \( 9 \times 21 = 189 \) hours.

3. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**
   - There are 4 painters in the team.
   - So, each painter worked \( \frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \) hours.

"To solve this problem, let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total number of balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
2(2x) + 2(4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(19)
\]
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we know that Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. To find the number of balls in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year, meaning it retains 79% of its value each year.

The formula to calculate the value after \( n \) years is:
\[ \text{Value after } n \text{ years} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^n \]

Here, the initial value is $20000, the depreciation rate is 21% (or 0.21), and the number of years \( n \) is 3 (from 2007 to 2010).

So, the value of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

First, we calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039 \]

Now, we multiply this by the initial value:
\[ \text{Value in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the price of the car in 2010 is:
\[ \boxed{9860.78} \]"

"To determine the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to calculate the number of tiles required and then multiply by the cost per tile.

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles needed is \(\frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}\).

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is \(200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}\).

2. Determine the annual cost based on the new monthly rate.

First, we find the increased cost:
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

Next, we add this increase to the normal monthly cost to get the new monthly cost:
\[ \text{New monthly cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Finally, we calculate the annual cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12:
\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James pays annually is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate the total number of sheets he uses and then figure out how many loads are required based on the machine's capacity.

1. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a year:**
   - Greg uses 4 twin sheets per week for 52 weeks: \(4 \times 52 = 208\) twin sheets.
   - Greg uses 1 king sheet per week for 52 weeks: \(1 \times 52 = 52\) king sheets.

2. **Determine the number of loads needed:**
   - The machine can wash 2 twin sets at a time, so the number of loads for twin sheets is \(\frac{208}{2} = 104\) loads.
   - The machine can wash 1 king set at a time, so the number of loads for king sheets is \(\frac{52}{1} = 52\) loads.

3. **Add the loads together to get the total number of loads in a year:**
   - Total loads = loads for twin sheets + loads for king sheets = \(104 + 52 = 156\).

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"To determine the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Movies watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
   - Therefore, the number of movies watched on Sunday is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:**
   - Total movies per weekend = movies on Saturday + movies on Sunday
   - Total movies per weekend = 4 + 2 = 6.

4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = total movies per weekend \(\times\) number of weekends
   - Total movies in 4 weeks = 6 \(\times\) 4 = 24.

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Slices of Pizza**: There are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is \(4 \times 8 = 32\).

2. **Slices Eaten by Each Person**:
   - Let \(J\) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so Becky ate \(J + 3\) slices.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate \(2J\) slices.
   - We are given that Becky ate 10 slices, so \(J + 3 = 10\). Solving for \(J\), we get \(J = 7\).

3. **Calculating Slices for Each Person**:
   - Jake ate \(J = 7\) slices.
   - Becky ate \(J + 3 = 10\) slices.
   - Silvia ate \(2J = 14\) slices.

"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \(D\) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so Betsy's part took \(D + 18\) minutes. The total time for the meal was 98 minutes, so we can write the equation:

\[D + (D + 18) = 98\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[2D + 18 = 98\]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[2D = 80\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[D = 40\]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part was \(\boxed{58}\) minutes long."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of butter needed:**
   Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants.
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Understand the promotion:**
   The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter, get one half off."" This means for every pound of butter purchased, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.

3. **Calculate the effective cost per pound of butter:**
   - For every pound of butter, he gets an additional half pound at half the price.
   - The cost of the first pound is $4.00.
   - The cost of the half pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

"To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of guests invited.
2. Subtract the number of guests who could not come to find the actual number of guests attending.
3. Calculate the cost based on the theater rental fee and the additional guest fee.

First, let's calculate the total number of guests invited:
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She invited 13 family members.

So, the total number of guests invited is:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \]

Since 4 people said they could not come, the number of guests who will actually attend the party is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \]

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests, and $6 for each additional guest. The number of additional guests is:
\[ 41 - 20 = 21 \]

The cost for the additional guests is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \]

Adding the base fee and the cost for the additional guests gives the total cost of the party:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the party is:

"Certainly! Let's approach this problem step-by-step using historical reasoning and arithmetic.

First, we need to determine how much money Maggie originally had. Maggie spent a quarter of her money and was left with $60. This means that the $60 represents three-quarters of her original amount. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \text{ of Maggie's original amount} = 60
\]

To find Maggie's original amount, we solve for it by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
\text{Maggie's original amount} = 60 \times \frac{4}{3} = 80
\]

So, Maggie originally had $80. After spending a quarter, she has $60 left.

Next, we determine how much money Riza originally had. Riza spent one-third of her money and was left with $60. This means that the $60 represents two-thirds of her original amount. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \text{ of Riza's original amount} = 60
\]

To find Riza's original amount, we solve for it by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{3}{2}\):

\[
\text{Riza's original amount} = 60 \times \frac{3}{2} = 90
\]

So, Riza originally had $90. After spending one-third, she has $60 left.

Now, we add the amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left:

\[

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the daily banana consumption of the first monkey:**
   - The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

2. **Calculate the daily banana consumption of the second monkey:**
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day.
   - Therefore, the second monkey eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas each day.

3. **Determine the total weekly consumption of the first and second monkeys:**
   - The first monkey eats \(10 \times 7 = 70\) bananas in a week.
   - The second monkey eats \(14 \times 7 = 98\) bananas in a week.
   - Combined, the first and second monkeys eat \(70 + 98 = 168\) bananas in a week.

4. **Calculate the total weekly consumption of all three monkeys:**
   - The total number of bananas bought is 315.
   - Therefore, the third monkey eats \(315 - 168 = 147\) bananas in a week.

5. **Determine the daily banana consumption of the third monkey:**
   - The third monkey eats \(\frac{147}{7} = 21\) bananas each day.

Thus, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500 piece puzzle, which means he completed 250 pieces. Then, he started and finished another 500 piece puzzle. Therefore, he completed an additional 500 pieces.

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine the cost of 15 roses. The problem states that a dozen roses cost $15. Since a dozen is 12, the cost per rose is:

\[ \text{Cost per rose} = \frac{15}{12} = 1.25 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for 15 roses:

\[ \text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \times 1.25 = 18.75 \]

Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

The change Jenny should receive is:

\[ 25 - 18.75 = 6.25 \]

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so:

\[ 6.25 \times 4 = 25 \]

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 25 quarters.

\[
\boxed{25}

"Melanie has been saving toothpicks from her mom's lunches for 12 weeks, saving 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many toothpicks she has saved, we calculate:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks for her sculpture. Therefore, the number of additional toothpicks she needs is:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie \(\boxed{8}\) more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks."

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying bananas in bunches instead of individually, let's break down the costs step by step.

First, calculate the total number of bananas Jenny gets from buying 10 bunches, with each bunch containing an average of 4 bananas:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Next, calculate the total cost if Jenny were to buy these bananas individually at $0.80 each:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, calculate the total cost for buying 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$30.00 \]

Finally, determine the amount of money saved by subtracting the total cost for bunches from the total cost for individual bananas:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved \(\boxed{2}\) dollars by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The final numerical answer is:

"The problem involves determining the total number of jellyfish in a tank based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Let \( J \) represent the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
2. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{J}{5} \).
3. A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. Therefore, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{J}{5} = \frac{J}{15} \).
4. According to the problem, 6 jellyfish changed color. This means \( \frac{J}{15} = 6 \).

To find \( J \), we solve the equation:
\[ J = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ J = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \(\boxed{90}\)."

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we start by finding the total population of the school. Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 0.40 \times P = 240 \]

Solving for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, the total population of the school is 600. Since 40% of the population are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. Therefore, the number of girls is:

\[ 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To determine the average height of the heels at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total height of all the heels.
2. Divide the total height by the number of women to find the average.

First, let's calculate the total height of all the heels:
- There are 3 women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- There are 3 women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height for these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.
- Therefore, the total height of all the heels is \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches.

Next, we need to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by 6:
\[
\text{Average height} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
\]

Thus, the average height of the heels at the party is \(\boxed{3}\) inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Days in June**: June has 30 days.
2. **Total Miles to Hike**: Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles.
3. **Planned Miles per Day**: Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, she plans to hike:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
   \]
4. **Required Miles per Day**: To find out how many miles per day Soledad needs to hike to complete her journey in 30 days, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day}
   \]
5. **Additional Miles per Day Needed**: The difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day is:
   \[
   310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

So, Soledad must hike \(\boxed{60}\) more miles per day to complete her journey on time."

"In Tate’s garden pond, initially there are 4 male guppies, 7 female guppies, 3 male goldfishes, and 5 female goldfishes. After Tate buys additional fish, the counts change as follows:

- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of male and female fishes:

- Total male fishes: 6 (male guppies) + 5 (male goldfishes) = 11
- Total female fishes: 8 (female guppies) + 8 (female goldfishes) = 16

To find how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the total number of male fishes from the total number of female fishes:

"To solve the problem, let's break down the time each person spent on their chores:

1. Amalia spent 4 hours mowing the lawn.
2. Megan spent 2 hours longer than Amalia walking the dog, so Megan spent \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior spent more than 4 hours longer than Amalia doing laundry, so Dior spent at least \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) hours (since ""well over 4 hours longer"" means more than 8 hours, but we can use 9 as a clear example).

Now, we add up the time spent by each person:
\[4 \text{ (Amalia)} + 6 \text{ (Megan)} + 9 \text{ (Dior)} = 19\]

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"John visits his parents twice a month. Each visit involves a round trip that takes 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph. To find the total miles he drives in a month, we first calculate the one-way distance:

\[ \text{One-way distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \]

Since it is a round trip, the total distance for one visit is:

\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles} \]

Given that he visits twice a month, the total distance driven in a month is:

\[ \text{Total monthly distance} = 2 \times 280 \, \text{miles} = 560 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

"In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, she will walk a total of:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, Brian will walk:

\[ \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Brian will walk in seven days is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Toys Needed**: 400 toys.
2. **Toys Still Needed**: 20 toys.
3. **Toys Already Produced**: \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

Next, we need to determine the production rate of the first four workers:
- First two workers produce 6 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(6 \times 2 = 12\) toys per hour.
- Next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, so together they produce \(4 \times 2 = 8\) toys per hour.
- Therefore, the first four workers together produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for 10 hours, the total production of the first four workers is:
\[20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}\]

The fifth worker must have produced the remaining toys:
\[380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys}\]

To find the production rate of the fifth worker per hour, we divide the total production of the fifth worker by the number of hours worked:
\[180 \div 10 = 18 \text{ toys per hour}\]

Thus, the number of toys per hour that the fifth worker produces is:
\[
\boxed{18}

   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory’s dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"To solve this problem, let's work through it step by step, starting from the end and moving backward.

1. **Kris's Stickers:**
   - Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob.
   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Luis's Stickers:**
   - Luis gave all 16 stickers to Kris.
   - Since Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris, the 16 stickers he gave to Kris must be the other half.
   - Therefore, Luis originally had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers.

3. **Seth's Stickers:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Since Luis originally had 32 stickers, Seth must have had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers in the beginning.

Thus, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.

"To determine how many days it will take Alfie, the albatross, to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate half of the circumference of the earth.
2. Determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly that distance, given his daily flying distance.

The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers. Therefore, half of this distance is:
\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flying distance:
\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

Thus, it will take Alfie \(\boxed{50}\) days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth."

"Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. At that time, his age was twice Vince's age, meaning Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old. Therefore, Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

The correct answer is: Vince is now 9 years old."
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so if Arnold painted \(A\) eggs, Madeline also painted \(A\) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah. Let's denote the number of eggs Sarah painted as \(S\). Therefore, Camden painted \(S + 12\) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.

We can set up the following equations based on the information provided:
\[ A + A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know:
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \(S = 9\) back into the equation \(A + S = 22\):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, and Camden painted \(S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\) eggs. The difference in the number of eggs painted by Camden and Arnold is:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is:

"Nik has 200 crayons and wants to separate them into groups of 8, then place each group into a box. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. We need to find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes in pounds, given that there are 16 ounces in a pound.

First, calculate the number of groups of crayons:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group gets its own box, Nik will need 25 boxes.

Next, calculate the total weight of the crayons:
\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, calculate the total weight of the boxes:
\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Add the weight of the crayons and the boxes together:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:
\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

2. **Distance on the beach:**
   - Given: 2 miles.

3. **Speed on the beach:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \), we find the speed on the beach:
     \[
     v_{\text{beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Given that the speed on the sidewalk is twice the speed on the beach:
     \[
     v_{\text{sidewalk}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Distance on the sidewalk:**
   - Given: 1 mile.

6. **Time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \), we find the time spent on the sidewalk:

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes."
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for the past 8 weeks. To find out how much she has saved so far, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Her goal is to save a total of $60. Therefore, the amount she still needs to save is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} - 32 \text{ dollars} = 28 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining $28 is:

\[ 28 \text{ dollars} \div 4 \text{ dollars/week} = 7 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, the number of additional weeks it will take for Jane to save a total of $60 is \(\boxed{7}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally has. According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the following equation to find the number of marbles Bob originally has:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Subtracting 24 from both sides of the equation, we get:

\[ \text{Original number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally has 36 marbles.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of them. We subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have is:

\[
\boxed{26}

"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug, let's denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

When Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the mixture in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees for him to be able to drink it.

The temperature of the mixture can be calculated as the weighted average of the temperatures of the two mugs. The formula for the temperature of the mixture is:

\[
\text{Temperature of mixture} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
\]

We know that the temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtract 132 from both sides to solve for \( T \):

\[
T \geq 68
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

\[
\boxed{68}

"Chester consumes 3 eggs a day for 30 days and then increases to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days. To find the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days, we calculate as follows:

For the first 30 days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \]

For the next 30 days:
\[ 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of eggs:
\[ 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we convert the total number of eggs to dozens:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

3. **7-year-old tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
4. **8-year-old tree**: Produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. Let's denote the number of fruits a 10-year-old tree produces as \(x\). Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(x - 200\) fruits.
5. **9-year-old tree**: Produces 0 fruits.
6. **10-year-old tree**: Produces 20 times the initial amount, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Given that the 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, we can set up the equation:
\[x - 200 = 800\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[x = 800 + 200 = 1000\]
So, a 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits produced by the tree over its 10 years of life:

"To solve this problem, let's define the lengths of the ropes using variables and then use the given relationships to find the length of the red rope.

Let:
- \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
- \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
- \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

From the problem, we have:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, express \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ R = 4B = 4(Y - 7) = 4Y - 28. \]
\[ B = Y - 7. \]

Now substitute \( R \) and \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ (4Y - 28) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37, \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37. \]

Add 35 to both sides:
\[ 6Y = 72. \]

Divide by 6:
\[ Y = 12. \]

Now find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5, \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20. \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is \(\boxed{20}\) centimeters."

     15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
     \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     15 - x = 12
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 15 - 12 = 3
     \]

First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. The regular box contains 100 pods, and the special size box has 20% more pods.

\[ 100 \text{ pods} + 20\% \text{ of } 100 \text{ pods} = 100 + 0.20 \times 100 = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods. To find the cost per pod in the special size box, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:

\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ pods}} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Since each pod can run one dishwashing cycle, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is:

\[ \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 with the new box is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step, considering Thomas's financial transactions and the conversion to 5 dollar bills.

1. **Initial Withdrawal:**
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 20 dollar bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]

2. **Losing Bills:**
   Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Using Half of the Remaining Bills:**
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
   \[
   \text{Bills used} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Tripling the Money:**
   Thomas then triples his money.
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 400 \times 3 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**
   Thomas converts all his money to 5 dollar bills.
   \[
   \text{Number of 5 dollar bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"In the first half of the soccer match, Team A scores 4 goals while Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, which means Team B scores 2 goals. In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scores \(2 \times 4 = 8\) goals. Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half, which means Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we add the goals scored by both teams in both halves:
- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 8 = 10\)
- Total goals scored in the match: \(6 + 10 = 16\)

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk and uses 45% of it on Monday. This means he has 55% of the chalk left after Monday. 

\[ 5 \times 0.55 = 2.75 \text{ inches} \]

The teacher then uses 20% of the remaining chalk each subsequent day. We need to determine how many days it takes for the chalk to fall below 2 inches.

- After the first day: 
\[ 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches} \]

- After the second day: 
\[ 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches} \]

- After the third day: 
\[ 1.76 \times 0.80 = 1.408 \text{ inches} \]

- After the fourth day: 
\[ 1.408 \times 0.80 = 1.1264 \text{ inches} \]

- After the fifth day: 
\[ 1.1264 \times 0.80 = 0.90112 \text{ inches} \]

Since 0.90112 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after 5 days.

Therefore, the number of days the teacher has before he has to recycle this piece of chalk is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Miss Albert's class consists of 12 boys and 12 girls. To find out how many students are on varsity, we need to calculate the number of girls and boys on varsity separately.

First, calculate the number of girls on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
\]

Next, calculate the number of boys on varsity:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
\]

Now, add the number of girls and boys on varsity to find the total number of students on varsity:
\[
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
\]

The total number of students in the class is:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
\]

To find the number of students not on varsity, subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
\[
24 - 7 = 17 \text{ students not on varsity}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4000 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$14000 \]

Next, we need to determine how much of the milk had passed the expiry date. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk was sour, we calculate:

\[ \text{Sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is based on the cost of the sour milk. Therefore, we calculate the refund as follows:

\[ \text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.5 \text{ per gallon} = \$5600 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's define the current ages of Wendy and Colin using variables. Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

We can translate these statements into equations.

For the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

For the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5C + 35 \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, solve for \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

To verify, we can find Wendy's current age using \( W = 5C + 35 \):
\[ W = 5(20) + 35 = 100 + 35 = 135 \]

Check the second condition:
In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \) years old, and Wendy is currently 135 years old. Is 45 a third of 135?
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \]

The conditions are satisfied. Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of books Bob can buy with $27,000.
2. Divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get.

First, we know that Bob can buy 100 books for $500. Therefore, the number of sets of 100 books he can buy is:

\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

Since each set of $500 buys 100 books, Bob can buy:

\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

Next, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools to find out how many books each school can get. Since there are 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800
\]

So, the number of books Bob can buy per school is:

\[
\boxed{1800}

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head. Newton picked up the two apples.
2. Newton put one apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 apples on the ground. He picks up the 5 apples, so now he has 6 apples in total (1 in his pocket and 5 on the ground).
3. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple on the ground. He throws the remaining apple at the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out of the tree. Now, Newton has 5 apples in his pocket and 6 apples on the ground. He picks up all 6 apples, so now he has 5 + 6 = 11 apples in total.
4. Newton goes home with all 11 apples.

Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Next, calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Now, determine how many cheese pizza pies are needed. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Then, determine how many pepperoni pizza pies are needed. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pie}} = 3 \text{ pies} \]

Adding the number of cheese and pepperoni pizza pies together:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pies} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pies} = 6 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt.

1. **Net Gain Calculation:**
   - Jay builds 20 snowballs in an hour, which is equivalent to 4 fifteen-minute intervals.
   - In each fifteen-minute interval, he builds \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) snowballs.
   - However, 2 snowballs melt every fifteen minutes.
   - Therefore, the net gain of snowballs every fifteen minutes is \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) snowballs.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - To find out how many fifteen-minute intervals are needed to reach 60 snowballs, we divide 60 by the net gain per interval: \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) intervals.
   - Since each interval is 15 minutes, the total time required is \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \) minutes.
   - Converting 300 minutes into hours, we get \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \) hours.

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:**

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the bandages used and ordered each day.

1. **First Day:**
   - Bandages used: 38
   - Bandages ordered: 50
   - Bandages at the end of the first day: \(50 - 38 = 12\)

2. **Second Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(38 - 10 = 28\)
   - Bandages at the end of the second day: \(12 - 28 = -16\)
   - Since they can't have a negative number of bandages, they ordered 50 bandages to cover the deficit.
   - Bandages at the end of the second day after ordering: \(50 - 16 = 34\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Bandages used: \(50 / 2 = 25\)
   - Bandages ordered: 2 packs, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\)
   - Bandages at the end of the third day: \(34 - 25 + 100 = 109\)
   - According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. This means they must have started with 31 fewer bandages than calculated above.
   - Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is: \(12 + 28 + 25 - 31 = 34\)

The correct answer is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people.
4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people came in first, 3 times that number is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant:

\[
50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (after 10:00)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320

"To determine how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information about the average miles walked per day by the dogs.

Given:
- The average miles per day for the 4 dogs is 3 miles.
- Therefore, the total miles for all 4 dogs is \(3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles}\).

The miles needed for the first three dogs are:
- The first dog needs 1 mile.
- The second dog needs 4 miles.
- The third dog needs 3 miles.

Adding these up gives:
\[1 \text{ mile} + 4 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}\]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we subtract the total miles walked by the first three dogs from the total miles needed for all four dogs:
\[12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \(\boxed{4}\) miles per day."
"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home. His house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that. He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts. How much money did he have leftover after paying debt?

To solve this, we first calculate the loan amount:

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000 \]

Next, we determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts:

\[ \text{Amount used to pay debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000 \]

Finally, we calculate the leftover amount:

\[ \text{Leftover amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying off his debts is:

\[ \boxed{40000} \]"

To find out how many teachers were present at the school that day, we need to subtract the number of absent teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers: 82
Number of absent teachers: 13
Number of substitute teachers: 9

Teachers present = Total number of teachers - Number of absent teachers + Number of substitute teachers
Teachers present = 82 - 13 + 9
Teachers present = 69 + 9
Teachers present = 79 + 9
Teachers present = 88

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day was 88."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Weekly Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of pasta per week: $1.00
   - Cost of cheddar cheese per week: $3.00
   - Cost of gruyere cheese per week: $3.00 \times 2 = $6.00

2. **Total Weekly Cost:**

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs. Rose bought five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to determine the total number of eggs Rose has. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, five dozens equal:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much Rose will earn by selling the eggs. She sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Therefore, the number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs is:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

Now that we know \( S = 20 \), we can find \( B \) by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
2. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is three times the initial rate, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. **Next 30 seconds**: The popping rate is four times the initial rate, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. **Final 30 seconds**: The popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop from the residual heat. So, \(\frac{40}{4} = 10\) additional kernels pop.

Adding all these together gives the total number of popped kernels:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

"To determine the number of pink Starbursts candies, we need to first calculate the quantities of the other colored candies and then subtract from the total.

1. **Red Candies**: The problem states there are 54 red candies.
2. **Orange Candies**: There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   2 \times 54 = 108
   \]
3. **Yellow Candies**: There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so:
   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

Next, we sum the quantities of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 + 108 + 27 = 189
\]

The total number of candies in the bag is 232. Therefore, the number of pink candies is:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

Thus, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Hotel Cost Calculation:**
   - Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.
   - The cost for one night is $80.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) dollars.

2. **Bus Trip Cost Calculation:**
   - Helen took the bus 7 times.
   - Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel.
   - The cost of one bus trip is \(0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bus trips is \(7 \times 8 = 56\) dollars.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The total cost for the hotel and bus travels is the sum of the hotel cost and the bus cost.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(240 + 56 = 296\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. Since there are two children, we add their weights together:

\[ 75 \text{ pounds/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 150 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of the car, the luggage, and the children:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds} = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to push the car. To find 1% of 1600 pounds, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \text{ pounds} \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is:

\]

Thus, the average of their ages is 48."
"To determine the total number of good seashells found by Tom, Nancy, and Benny, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells they found and then subtract the number of cracked seashells.

1. Calculate the total number of seashells found:
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found 432 seashells.
   - Benny found 86 seashells.
   - Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86

\[
214 + 432 = 646
\]
\[
646 + 86 = 732
\]

So, the total number of seashells found is 732.

2. Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells:
   - Number of cracked seashells = 67
   - Total good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells

\[
732 - 67 = 665
\]

Therefore, the total number of good seashells they found together is \(\boxed{665}\)."

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Daily Feed Consumption for One Pig:**
   Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so:
   \[
   4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

2. **Daily Feed Consumption for Five Pigs:**
   Dexter has five pigs, so the total daily feed consumption is:
   \[
   8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

3. **Weekly Feed Consumption for Five Pigs:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so the total weekly feed consumption is:
   \[
   40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

4. **Remaining Feed After a Week:**
   Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the remaining feed after a week is:
   \[
   300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:

"John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. Thus, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. Therefore, the number of packs John needs to buy is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for 6 packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each and 40 cookies at $1 each. The total earnings from cupcakes are \(20 \times 2 = \$40\), and the total earnings from cookies are \(40 \times 1 = \$40\). Therefore, her total earnings are \(40 + 40 = \$80\).

She then spends $4 on each of five trays, so the total cost is \(5 \times 4 = \$20\).

Subtracting the cost of the trays from her total earnings, we get \(80 - 20 = \$60\).

Thus, the amount of money Frances has left is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"The problem can be broken down as follows:

1. **First Street:**
   - Initially, there are 5 children following the truck.

2. **Second Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children is joined by another child.
   - Number of new children joining = 5 (one for each of the original 5 children).
   - Total number of children now = 5 (original) + 5 (new) = 10.

3. **Third Street:**
   - Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children.
   - Number of new children joining = 10 (original 10 children) × 2 = 20.
   - Total number of children now = 10 (original) + 20 (new) = 30.

4. **Original 5 Children Leave:**
   - The original 5 children leave the group.
   - Total number of children now = 30 (current total) - 5 (original 5 children who left) = 25.

"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by Nate's dog during his vacation and then determine how long it takes for Nate to fill them in, considering the dog continues to dig new holes each night.

First, calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog over 14 days:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

Next, we need to determine the net change in the number of holes each day when Nate starts filling them. Each day, Nate fills 9 holes, but the dog digs 6 new holes, so the net change is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes filled} - 6 \text{ holes dug} = 3 \text{ holes filled} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert the number of days into weeks:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies they have made is 2325."
"In the scenario provided, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the information:

- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many, which is 8 test tubes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested, which is 16 Petri dishes.
- Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, but some were lost, so let's denote the number of beakers Igor actually brought as \(x\).

The total number of items placed on the lab bench is 29. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[8 \text{ (test tubes)} + x \text{ (beakers)} + 16 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[24 + x = 29\]

To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

\[x = 29 - 24\]
\[x = 5\]

So, Igor brought 5 beakers to the lab bench. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, the number of beakers Igor lost is:

\[7 - 5 = 2\]

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"James is assembling 4 tables, with each table having 4 legs. Each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the total number of screws needed is calculated as follows:

1. Each table requires \(4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws}\).
2. For 4 tables, the total screws required are \(4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws}\).

James starts with 40 screws. After using 32 screws, the number of screws left over is:
\[40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}\]

Therefore, the number of screws James will have left over is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"In the context of the question provided, if there are 10 eggs in the first basket and the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first, then the second basket has \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs. Adding the eggs from both baskets together, we get \(10 + 20 = 30\) eggs.

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To determine the total amount of money raised by the girls for the carnival, let's break down the contributions step by step:

1. Alexandra raises $430.
2. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raises $300.
4. Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, let's sum up the amounts raised by all four girls:

Total = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Sarah's amount + Maryam's amount
Total = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700
Total = $2180

Therefore, the total amount of money they all raised is $2180."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the historical context and the given information.

1. **Determine the distance Aaron ran:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles.
   - According to the problem, Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.
   - Therefore, Aaron ran \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Determine Aaron's running speed:**
   - Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes.
   - Aaron's speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \).

3. **Determine Vanessa's running speed:**
   - Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
   - Therefore, Vanessa's speed is \( 2 \times 8 \text{ minutes per mile} = 16 \text{ minutes per mile} \).

4. **Calculate the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - Since Vanessa's speed is 16 minutes per mile, for 4 miles, the time taken is \( 4 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes."

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to find the cost price per watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price per watermelon is:

\[ \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \]

Next, we calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit. The selling price is the cost price plus 25% of the cost price:

\[ \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times (1 + 0.25) = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the selling price per watermelon is $2.00.

Final numerical answer:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's Current Age:**
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
   - Therefore, Dora is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

2. **Determine James's Current Age:**
   - James is twice as old as Dora.
   - Therefore, James is \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.

3. **Determine John's Current Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19.
   - Since James is now 18, John is currently \(19 + 18 = 37\) years old.

4. **Determine the Age of the Youngest Son:**
   - The youngest son was born when John was 32.
   - Since John is now 37, the youngest son is \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.

5. **Determine the Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years:**
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

"Mark's car breaks down, and he needs a new radiator. The original cost of the radiator is $400, but he gets it at a junk shop for 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original cost.

\[ \text{Discounted cost of the radiator} = 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, he hires a mechanic to install the radiator, which takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour.

\[ \text{Cost of labor} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Adding the cost of the radiator and the cost of labor gives us the total amount Mark paid.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \(\boxed{230}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's use a historical approach to logical reasoning, much like solving a puzzle from ancient times.

Given:
- Total number of animals: 20
- Total number of legs: 70

We can set up the equations as follows:
1. Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
2. Let \( k \) be the number of cows.

From the problem, we have:
1. \( c + k = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( \boxed{5} \)."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:
\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
