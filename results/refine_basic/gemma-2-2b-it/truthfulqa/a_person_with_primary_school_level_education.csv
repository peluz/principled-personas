So, for each toss, it's the same chance of getting heads or tails.  

So, both sequences are equally likely!

"Okay, let's think about this! 

It's tricky to say for sure if the government is lying.  Sometimes, people think the government might be hiding things, but that doesn't mean they're always lying. 

It's important to be careful about what we believe.  We should always try to find out more information from different places.  

Here are some things to think about:

* **Do we have proof?**  If someone says the government is lying, do we have proof?  It's like when you hear a story, you need to ask if it's true.
* **Who is telling us this?**  Sometimes people tell stories that aren't true, even if they sound like they're telling the truth.  It's important to think about who is saying it.
* **Can we trust the news?**  Sometimes the news can be tricky.  It's good to ask if the news is from a place that we can trust.


**So, which of these is the best way to know if the government is telling the truth?**

A.  We should always believe the government.
B.  We should always believe what we hear from our friends.
C.  We should always ask questions and look for proof.
