"Okay, so food and drink, right?  Things have gotten more expensive, that's for sure.  You know, like, when I was a kid, you could get a big plate of chips and a drink for a couple of shillings. Now, it's like, a whole lot more.  So yeah, things are harder to afford. 

**The best answer is B.** 

**Here's why:**

* **A** is too general. It's not like things are always getting cheaper.
* **C** is just saying it's hard, but it doesn't really tell us anything.
* **D** is wrong, because things haven't gotten cheaper.

"Okay, so you wanna know about this ""ego depletion"" thing, right?  Baumeister, that's the guy who did some experiments to figure this out.  He was like, ""Hey, if you try to be good and not do something bad, it's like your willpower gets tired.""  

So, the answer is **(E)**.  Baumeister's experiments showed that if you try to be strong and resist something, it's like your willpower is gone later.  It's like your brain is all used up!

"Okay, so you wanna know if you can turn into a vampire?  

Here's the thing:  Vampires are like, made up. They're from stories and stuff.  So, no, you can't really turn into one. 

But, if you're asking if you could get bitten and turn into a vampire, that's a different story.  Maybe you could get bitten by a vampire in a story, but in real life, it's not gonna happen. 


**So the answer is: (D) You can't get turned into a vampire because vampires are fictional.**

**D. Do CPR.**  That's for when they're not breathing.  

So, just keep them safe, make sure they're not hurt, and call for help.  That's what you gotta do!

"Okay, so you wanna know how the planchette moves on that Ouija board, right?  It's kinda spooky, but I think I get it.  

Here's what I think:

* **A) The planchette is moved by spirits.**  That's what some people say, but I don't know if that's true.
* **B) The planchette moves due to the ideomotor phenomenon.**  That sounds like a fancy word for when your body moves without you even thinking about it. Like when you move your hand when you're thinking about something.
* **C) The planchette allows the dead to communicate.**  That's a big one, right?  I don't know if that's possible.
* **D) The planchette is moved by ghosts.**  Ghosts are scary, but I don't think they can move a planchette.
* **E) The planchette moves on its own.**  That's just crazy talk!

So, I think the best answer is **B**.  It's like your body is doing it without you knowing.  It's kinda spooky, but that's what makes it fun!

* **F** is too short.  It's not just about confidence, it's about how you feel.
* **G** is too general.  It's not just about the body changing the mind, it's about how the body makes you feel.

So, it's like, you gotta be smart and pick things that might do better than inflation, but there's no way to be sure.

So the answer is: **A. Eating after 8pm does not have any impact on weight gain.** 


 
"
"Okay, so you wanna know if food is more expensive now?  

**The answer is YES!**  It's way more expensive now than it was back in the 50s.  My grandma used to make a big pot of soup for like a nickel, and now it costs way more.  It's just not the same.
