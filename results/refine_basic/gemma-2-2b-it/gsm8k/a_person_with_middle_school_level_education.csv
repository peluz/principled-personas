"Okay, so Carla's downloading a big file, 200 GB.  She's getting it at 2 GB per minute.  But then, Windows makes her computer restart to install some updates. That takes 20 minutes.  Then she has to start over.  So, how long does it take to download the whole thing?

Here's how to figure it out:

* **First, how long did she download before the restart?**  She downloaded 80 GB, which is 40% of the whole file.  So, it took her 40 minutes to get that far.
* **Then, she has to restart.** That takes 20 minutes.
* **Now, how much more does she need to download?**  She has 120 GB left.
* **How long will it take to download the rest?**  That's 120 GB divided by 2 GB per minute, which is 60 minutes.

**So, it takes Carla 60 minutes to download the rest of the file.**

"Okay, so John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, that's 180 miles. Then he turns around because he forgot something. He tries to get home in 4 hours, but it takes him 2 hours in traffic, so he's driving for 2 hours at 30 mph, that's 30 miles.  He then drives the rest of the way at 80 mph for 2 hours, that's another 160 miles.  So, he drives a total of 180 + 30 + 160 = 370 miles. 

**Answer:** 370 miles

"Okay, so Toula bought donuts, cupcakes, and cheesecakes.  

* Donuts cost $68 per dozen, so 3 dozen cost $68 * 3 = $204.
* Mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen, so 2 dozen cost $80 * 2 = $160.
* Mini cheesecakes cost $55 per dozen, so 6 dozen cost $55 * 6 = $330.

To find the total cost, we add all the prices: $204 + $160 + $330 = $794.

"Okay, so Marissa hiked 4 miles the first hour and another 2 miles the next hour. That's a total of 6 miles.  She wants to average 4 miles per hour, so she needs to walk the last 6 miles in a certain amount of time.  

To figure that out, we can use the formula: 
* Distance / Time = Speed

We know the distance is 6 miles and she wants to average 4 miles per hour. Let's figure out the time.

* 6 miles / 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours

So, she needs to walk the last 6 miles in 1.5 hours. 

To find the speed for the last 6 miles, we can use the same formula:

* 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles/hour

"Okay, so we have 10 liters of orange drink that's mostly water, and we're adding it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that's also mostly water.  

First, let's figure out how much water is in each drink.  The orange drink has two-thirds water, so that's 6.67 liters. The pineapple drink has three-fifths water, which is 9 liters.

Now, let's add them up: 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters.  

But wait, we spilled a liter of the orange drink!  So we need to take that into account.  

The total amount of water in the drinks is 15.67 liters - 1 liter = 14.67 liters. 

**Answer:** 14.67 liters

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Raymond's age:** Samantha is 31, and Raymond was born 6 years before her, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old.
* **Raymond's son's age:** Raymond was 23 when he had his son.
* **Age difference:** Raymond's son is 23 - 25 = -2 years old. 

Since the age difference is negative, it means Raymond's son was born 2 years *before* Raymond's 23rd birthday.

"Okay, so Kyle got the book for $19.50, and that's with a 25% discount.  To figure out the original price, we need to figure out what the price was before the discount. 

Think about it like this: the discount is like taking off a part of the original price.  

Let's say the original price was $x.  The discount is 25% of that price, which is 0.25 times the original price.

So, we can write an equation:

$19.50 = $x - 0.25 * $x

Now, let's solve for x:

$19.50 = $x - $0.25x
$19.50 = $0.75x
$19.50 / $0.75 = $x
$26 = $x

So, the original price of the book was $26.

"Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes.  One pair of shorts costs $16.50, one pair of pants costs $22.50, and one pair of shoes costs $42.  To find out how much Mishka spent, we need to add up the cost of each item.  

* Shorts: 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50
* Pants: 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50
* Shoes: 3 pairs * $42.00/pair = $126.00
 
The total cost is $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00 

So the answer is **$243.00**

"Cynthia eats ice cream every night, and she buys cartons with 15 servings each.  She wants to know how much she'll spend on ice cream in 60 days.  

To figure that out, we need to know how many cartons she'll buy.  She eats 60 servings, and each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 60 / 15 = 4 cartons.

Now, each carton costs $4.00, so she'll spend 4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00 on ice cream. 


**Answer:** $16.00

"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are in a special ratio, like a secret code!  They're 7 to 11.  That means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11.  

We know their ages add up to 162.  Let's figure out how old Darrell is now.  

* Let's say Darrell is 7 times as old as Allen.
* That means Darrell is 7x years old, and Allen is 11x years old.
*  Their ages add up to 162, so 7x + 11x = 162.
*  Combine the 'x' terms: 18x = 162
*  Divide both sides by 18 to find 'x': x = 9
*  Now we know Darrell is 7 times 'x', so Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old.
*  Allen is 11 times 'x', so Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.
*  In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

**Answer:** Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years.

"Here's how to figure out the average:

* **First guess:** 80 jelly beans
* **Second guess:**  The second guess is 20 more than half of the first guess, which is 40. So, the second guess is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
* **Third guess:** The third guess is 25% more than the first guess, which is 80. So, the third guess is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100 jelly beans.
* **Total guesses:** 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 jelly beans
* **Average:** 240 jelly beans / 3 guesses = 80 jelly beans

"Let's break this down!

* Gretchen has 110 coins in total.
* She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

To find out how many gold coins she has, we need to figure out how many silver coins she has first. 

Let's say there are 'x' silver coins.  Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver, that means she has x + 30 gold coins.

The total number of coins is the sum of her silver and gold coins, so we can write that as:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Now we can solve for 'x':

* Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110
* Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. 

Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver, she has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.


**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"Raymond has 40 jewels.  To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to figure out how many jewels Aaron has. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, which is 20. So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels. 

**Answer:** 23

"Mike played for 40 minutes and scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  In the next 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points.  To find out how many points he scored in total, we need to figure out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes.  

* 20 minutes * 0.25 = 5 more points
* 4 points + 5 points = 9 points
* 4 points + 9 points = 13 points

So, Mike scored a total of 13 points.

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they're on sale for $5.00 for 4 yogurts.  So, how much does he spend on yogurt in 30 days?

**Here's how to figure that out:**

* **Cost per yogurt:**  He buys 4 yogurts for $5.00, so each yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt.
* **Total cost for 30 days:** He eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days he'll eat 2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts.
* **Total cost:**  He spends $1.25/yogurt * 60 yogurts = $75.00

**Answer:** $75.00

"John sold his Lego sets for $15 each, and he sold 13 sets.  He then bought 8 video games for $20 each, spending $160 in total.  He had $5 left after buying the video games.  

To figure out how many Lego sets he still has, we need to figure out how much money he had before buying the video games.  He had $200 before buying the video games. 

So, he has 13 sets left.

"Okay, so John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?

To figure this out, we need to know how many miles he runs each of the other two days.  He runs 3 hours on the first day, and then half as much on the other two days, so he runs 1.5 hours each of the other two days.  

To find out how many miles he runs in total, we need to add up the miles he runs on all three days.  He runs 60 miles a week.

To find his average speed, we need to divide the total distance he runs by the total time he runs.  He runs 60 miles in 9 hours. 

So, his average speed is 60 miles / 9 hours = 6.67 miles per hour. 



**Answer:** 6.67

"Okay, so Dana can run really fast!  She's four times faster than she walks.  We know she can skip at 3 miles per hour.  

To figure out how far she can travel in six hours, we need to figure out how long she spends running and walking.  She spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking.

* **Running:** She runs for 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours.
* **Walking:** She walks for 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Now, let's think about how far she runs and walks.  

* **Running:** Dana runs 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.
* **Walking:** Dana walks 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles.

Finally, to find her total distance, we add the distance she runs and walks: 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles.

**Answer:** Dana can travel 24 miles in six hours.

"Okay, so the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.  If you have 5 servings, that's 250 calories * 5 = 1250 calories.  You've already eaten 1800 calories, so you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.  To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to figure out how many servings that is.  Each serving is 250 calories, so 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.  Since each serving is 250 grams, you can eat 0.8 servings * 250 grams/serving = 200 grams.

"Okay, so Meredith writes blog posts.  She writes 5 posts on Monday.  On Tuesday, she writes twice as many as Monday, which is 2 * 5 = 10 posts.  Then on Wednesday, she writes twice as many as Tuesday, which is 2 * 10 = 20 posts.  That's a total of 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 posts.  She spends 4 hours on each post, so she spends 35 * 4 = 140 hours writing. 

**Answer:** 140

"Tracy cut the wire into pieces that were 6 inches long.  To figure out how many pieces she got, we need to divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. 

* 4 feet is equal to 48 inches.
* 48 inches / 6 inches per piece = 8 pieces 

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.

"Okay, so Richard lives in a building with 15 floors.  Each floor has 8 apartments, and 3/4 of the building is filled up.  To find out how many apartments are empty, we need to figure out how many apartments are empty. 

First, we need to know how many apartments are in the whole building.  We know there are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 apartments, so there are 15 * 8 = 120 apartments.

Then, we know that 3/4 of the building is filled up, so we need to figure out how many apartments are empty.  We can do this by subtracting the number of filled apartments from the total number of apartments.  So, 120 - 90 = 30. 

**Answer:** 30

"Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs each day. He sells them in sets of 12, so he gets 252 / 12 = 21 sets of eggs each day.  He sells each set for $2, so he makes 21 * $2 = $42 each day.  That means he makes $42 every week! 


**Answer:** $42

"Okay, so Tom's ship travels 10 miles per hour going from 1 to 4 PM.  Then he goes back at 6 miles per hour.  To figure out how long it takes him to get back, we need to know how long it takes him to travel back. 

Let's think about it:

* He travels 30 miles going from 1 to 4 PM.
* He travels back at 6 miles per hour.

To find out how long it takes him to go back, we can use the distance and speed. 

* Distance = 30 miles
* Speed = 6 miles per hour
* Time = Distance / Speed = 30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours

So, it takes him **5 hours** to get back.

"Okay, so Uriah has 15 pounds he needs to take out of his bag.  He has 30 comic books, and they weigh 1/4 of a pound each.  That's 30 comic books * (1/4 pound/comic book) = 7.5 pounds.  He also has toys that weigh 1/2 a pound each.  To figure out how many toys he needs to take out, we need to find out how much weight is in the toys.  We know he needs to take out 15 pounds total, and he already took out 7.5 pounds of comic books.  So, he needs to take out 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds of toys.  Since each toy weighs 1/2 a pound, he needs to take out 7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 15 toys.

"Okay, so the mechanic repairs trucks and cars.  He charges $60 for trucks and $40 for cars.  

On Thursday, he fixed 6 trucks and 4 cars.  That's a total of 6 * $60 + 4 * $40 = $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, he fixed 12 cars, but no trucks.  That's 12 * $40 = $480.

To find out how much more he made on Thursday, we subtract Friday's earnings from Thursday's: $520 - $480 = $40. 

So the answer is $40.

"Okay, so Judy teaches dance classes.  She teaches 5 classes every day from Monday to Friday, and then 8 on Saturday.  That's a lot of classes!  She charges $15 for each class.  

To figure out how much money she makes, we need to do a few things:

* **Weekday earnings:** She teaches 5 classes a day, 5 days a week, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 classes.
* **Weekday earnings:**  She charges $15 per class, so she makes 25 * $15 = $375.00
* **Saturday earnings:** She teaches 8 classes on Saturday, and she charges $15 per class, so she makes 8 * $15 = $120.00
* **Total weekly earnings:**  She makes $375.00 from weekdays + $120.00 from Saturday = $495.00

So, Judy makes $495.00 in a week!

"Okay, so Shiela bought five phones, and each one costs $150.  She's paying for them over three months.  They're charging her 2% interest on each phone.  To figure out how much she'll pay each month, we need to figure out the total cost and then add the interest. 

So, the total cost of the phones is $150 times 5, which is $750.  Then, we need to figure out how much interest she'll pay over three months.  That's 2% of $750, which is $15.  So, the total cost for the phones is $750 plus $15, which is $765.

"Here's how to figure out the average square footage:

* **Level 1:**  We know the top level is 16 square feet.
* **Level 2:**  The next level is half the size of the top level, so it's 16 / 2 = 8 square feet.
* **Level 3:**  The next level is half the size of the second level, so it's 8 / 2 = 4 square feet.
* **Level 4:**  The last level is half the size of the third level, so it's 4 / 2 = 2 square feet.

Now, let's add up all the square footage: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet.

Finally, divide the total square footage by the number of levels: 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet.

**Answer:** 7.5

"Cecilia needs to feed her puppy a lot of food!  She needs 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, then 2 cups a day for the rest of its life.  That's a lot of food!  

To figure out how many bags she'll need, we need to know how many days the puppy lives.  Let's say the puppy lives for a year.  

* **First, we need to figure out how much food the puppy eats in a year:** 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups
* **Then we need to figure out how much food the puppy eats for the rest of its life:** 365 days * 2 cups/day = 730 cups
* **Now we add those together:** 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups
* **Finally, we divide the total cups by how much is in each bag:** 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8 bags

**Answer:** Cecilia will need 8 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Okay, so Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  To find out how much David does, we know Sarah does 4 times as much as David. So David does 400 pounds / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  Now, Raymond does half as much as Sarah, so he does 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds.  The difference between Raymond and David is 200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds. 

**Answer:** 100

"Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.  To figure out which is cheaper, we need to see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers with each option.

If he buys 18 flowers in the 3-flower package, it will cost $2.50 for 3 flowers, so each flower costs $0.83.  If he buys 18 flowers in the 2-flower package, it will cost $1.00 for 2 flowers, so each flower costs $0.50.

So, he saves $0.83 - $0.50 = $0.33 per flower if he buys 18 flowers in the 2-flower package. 

**Answer:** Vincent saves $0.33 per flower.

"Okay, so two girls each got 1/6 of the water, which is like 1/3 of the total.  Then a boy got 6 liters.  To find out how much water is left, we need to figure out how much water is left after the girls and the boy got some.  So, we start with 24 liters and subtract the water the girls got, which is 8 liters.  That leaves us with 24 - 8 = 16 liters. Then we add the boy's water, which is 6 liters.  That makes a total of 16 + 6 = 22 liters.  Finally, we subtract the total amount of water the girls and the boy got, which is 22 - 24 = 2 liters.

"Charlie started with 10 stickers. He got 21 more, so he had 10 + 21 = 31 stickers. Then he got 23 more for his birthday, making a total of 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. He gave 9 to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he used 28 stickers for a card, leaving him with 45 - 28 = 17 stickers. 

So the answer is **17**.

"Okay, so Grace weighs 125 pounds.  Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight.  To figure out how much Alex weighs, we need to do some math.  

* Four times Grace's weight is 4 * 125 pounds = 500 pounds.
* Alex weighs 2 pounds less than that, so he weighs 500 pounds - 2 pounds = 498 pounds.

Finally, to find their combined weight, we just add their weights: 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds. 

So the answer is 623.

"So, Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses.  That's a total of 75 roses.  Each rose has 8 thorns, so we need to multiply that by the number of roses.  That gives us 75 roses * 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns. 

**Answer:** 600 
"
"So, they played 22 games.  They won more than they lost, which means they won 8 more than they lost.  To figure out how many they won, we need to figure out how many they lost.  If they lost 'x' games, they won 'x + 8' games.  We know that the total number of games they played is 22.  So, we can write an equation: x + (x + 8) = 22.  Let's solve for x: 2x + 8 = 22.  Then, we can subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14.  Finally, we can divide both sides by 2: x = 7.  So, they lost 7 games.  Since they won 8 more than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

"Okay, so Sylvie has worked at the company for 5 years.  That's pretty good!  

To figure out how much she'll make after 3 more years, we need to know how much her salary goes up each year.  

* **Year 1:** She gets a 10% raise, so her salary goes up by $600 * 0.10 = $60.
* **Year 2:** She gets another 10% raise, so her salary goes up by $660 * 0.10 = $66.
* **Year 3:** She gets another 10% raise, so her salary goes up by $726 * 0.10 = $72.60.

So, after 3 more years, Sylvie will make $798.60.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald. 
* Together they sold 88,000 copies.

Let's use that information to find out how many copies Harald sold.

**Think of it like this:**

* Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies.
* Marilyn sold 10 times that amount, so she sold 10x copies.

**Now, we know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000.**

* So, we can write an equation: x + 10x = 88,000

**Let's solve for x:**

* Combine the 'x' terms: 11x = 88,000
* Divide both sides by 11: x = 8,000

**Answer:** Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Okay, so Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.  Gerald gets a boost from his diet, and now he's running faster.  We know Lee runs in 38 seconds.  To figure out how fast Gerald runs now, we need to figure out how much faster he is. 

Let's think about it like this:

* Gerald's original time is 'x' seconds.
* Lee's time is 'x + 2' seconds.

We know Lee's time is 38 seconds, so we can write an equation:

x + 2 = 38

Now, let's solve for 'x'.  Subtract 2 from both sides:

x = 36

That means Gerald's original time was 36 seconds.  

Now, Gerald's diet helped him run faster, so we need to add 10% to his original time.  

Gerald's new time is 36 + 0.1 * 36 = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

* **Step 3:**  2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts. That means 2/3 * 120 girls = 80 girls are in the Girl Scouts.
* **Step 4:**  To find out how many girls aren't in the Girl Scouts, we subtract: 120 girls - 80 girls = 40 girls.

* **We know:** The whole city is 42 miles long.
* **To find out how long it takes:** We need to divide the total distance by the speed of the fog bank.

So, 42 miles / 3 miles/10 minutes = 14 minutes.

So, how many pieces are left?  We need to find the difference between the total pieces and the pieces Poppy and her mom put on the puzzle.  That's 1000 - 250 - 250 = 500 pieces. 


**Answer: 500**

"Frankie watched TV for a total of 7 hours.  He watched 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday, 1.5 hours on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday.  That's a total of 7 hours.  He watched 2.5 hours on Wednesday.  To figure out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday, we need to divide the total time he watched on Wednesday by the length of each episode.  He watched 2.5 hours on Wednesday, and each episode is 0.5 hours long.  So, he watched 2.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 5 episodes. 

**Answer:** 5

"Okay, so Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he made last year.  That means he baked 2 times the amount from last year.  He baked 15 more cookies than he planned, so he baked 2 times the amount he planned plus 15.  He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies.  Let's figure out how many cookies he baked last year. 

**Here's how to solve it:**

* Let's say he baked 'x' cookies last year.
* He baked 2 times that amount this year, so he baked 2x cookies.
* He baked 15 more cookies than he planned, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.
* He dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110 cookies.

**So, we can write an equation:** 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

**Let's solve for x:**

* 2x + 10 = 110
* 2x = 100
* x = 50

**Answer:** Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"So, the gas is $3.00 a gallon.  The app gives you $0.20 back for every gallon you buy.  If you buy 10 gallons, you'll get $2.00 back.  So, the total cost is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00. 

**Answer:** $28.00

"Okay, so Marcell and Beatrice are having a roll-up eating contest.  They both eat their whole roll-ups, and we need to figure out how many they ate in total. 

First, we need to figure out how much space each person's roll-ups take up.  Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 wide and 24 long, so that's 2 * 24 = 48 square roll-ups. Marcell's roll-ups are 3 wide and 14 long, so that's 3 * 14 = 42 square roll-ups.

Now, we need to add up the total area of their roll-ups. That's 48 + 42 = 90 square roll-ups.

Finally, we need to divide the total area by the number of people to find the average.  So, 90 / 2 = 45 square roll-ups per person. 


**Answer:** 45

"Okay, so Julia's boat is leaking water.  We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet.  To figure out how much water it took, we need to figure out how many feet she rowed.  

* **How many feet did she row?**  She rowed 20 feet.

* **How much water does the boat take in per 10 feet?**  It takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet.

* **How much water did she take in?**  She rowed 20 feet, so she took in 2 liters * (20 feet / 10 feet) = 4 liters of water. 


**Answer:** 4 liters

"The whiteboard gets cleaned 3 times per lesson, and each teacher has 2 lessons a day. So, we need to figure out how many times it gets cleaned in total. 

Here's how:

* **Lessons:** 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons
* **Cleanings:** 8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings

So, the whiteboard gets cleaned 24 times a day.

"Okay, so we know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures.  To figure out how many birds are in the picture, we need to figure out how many pictures Brittany's phone can hold.  

Brittany's phone can hold 6 times more pictures than Jamal's, so we can figure that out by dividing Jamal's pictures by 6. 

1800 / 6 = 300 pictures.

Now, we know Brittany's phone can hold 300 pictures.  To figure out how many birds are in the picture, we need to figure out how many times that number is bigger than the number of birds in Jamal's picture. 

We know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more pictures than the number of birds in Jamal's picture.  So, we can figure that out by dividing 300 by 50. 

300 / 50 = 6.

So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's picture.

"Okay, so Sasha has some leftover lumber.  She has 10 2x4x10 boards that cost $10 each, and 5 4x4x10 boards that cost $16 each.  She wants to sell them all.  

To figure out how much money she makes, we need to know how much she sells each board for.  

Let's say she sells each 2x4x10 board for $15.  

Here's how we can figure out her profit:

* **Cost of the 2x4x10 boards:** 10 boards * $10/board = $100
* **Cost of the 4x4x10 boards:** 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* **Total cost:** $100 + $80 = $180
* **Let's say she sells each 2x4x10 board for $15:** 10 boards * $15/board = $150
* **Let's say she sells each 4x4x10 board for $16:** 5 boards * $16/board = $80
* **Total selling price:** $150 + $80 = $230
* **Profit:** $230 - $180 = $50

**Sasha makes a profit of $50!**

"Okay, so we know Katy uses sugar and water in a special ratio.  It's 7 parts sugar to 13 parts water.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  

To figure out how much sugar she used, we need to figure out how many parts of the ratio that is.  

Let's think about it like this: if we have 7 parts of sugar, and we know she used 120 teaspoons, we can figure out how many parts of the ratio that is. 

We can do that by dividing the total teaspoons of sugar by the number of parts in the ratio. 

So, 120 teaspoons / 7 = 17.14 teaspoons per part.

"Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette and half as many oranges.  To find out how many fruits they have in total, we need to figure out how many of each fruit each person brought. 

Kael brought 10 apples (twice the amount Morisette brought) and 4 oranges (half the amount Morisette brought).

So, Morisette brought 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits.
Kael brought 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits.

Together they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

"Okay, so Dillon needs to buy watermelons, peppers, and oranges.  

* Watermelons cost three times as much as peppers, and oranges are $5 less than a watermelon. 
* He wants 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. 
* Each pepper costs $15.

Let's figure out the cost:

"The hospital makes a profit of $10,000. 

**Here's how we figure that out:**

* **Patients:** The hospital sees 500 people each day.
* **Time per patient:** Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
* **Total time:**  They see 500 people * 24 minutes/person = 12,000 minutes.
* **Doctor's fees:** The doctors charge $150 per hour.
* **Total doctor's fees:** They charge $150 per hour for 200 hours of work, which is $150 * 200 = $30,000.
* **Patient fees:** The hospital charges $200 per hour.
* **Total patient fees:** They charge $200 per hour for 200 hours of work, which is $200 * 200 = $40,000.
* **Profit:** The hospital makes $40,000 from patients and $30,000 from doctors, so they make $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Okay, so Steve lives 3 miles away and Tim lives 2 miles away.  Steve can bike really fast, 440 feet per minute. Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute. 

To figure out who gets home first, we need to see who gets there faster. 

* Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet.
* Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is 10,560 feet.

Let's see how long it takes Steve to get home:

* Steve's time = Distance / Speed
* Steve's time = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Now let's see how long it takes Tim:

* Tim's time = Distance / Speed
* Tim's time = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Tim takes 40 minutes, and Steve takes 36 minutes.  

The difference is 40 - 36 = 4 minutes. 

So, the winner will be waiting for **4** minutes.

"Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies.  He buys 60 cookies in total.  Each cookie costs $0.10.  So, the total cost is 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00.  He pays with a $10 bill, so he gets $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00 in change.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Seagull eats:** The seagull ate half of Dave's fries, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Pigeons eat:** Three pigeons ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Fries left:** After the seagull and pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.
* **Raccoon eats:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33.  Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 5.
* **Final count:** The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Answer:** There were 7 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it. 


"
"Okay, so Kimo has classes every day, but some days he has more classes than others.  Let's figure out how many hours he spends in class.

* **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:** He has 3 classes each day, and each class is an hour long, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours a day.  He does this 3 days a week, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 hours a week.
* **Tuesdays and Thursdays:** He has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours a day.  He does this 2 days a week, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours a week.
* **Total:**  He has 9 hours a week from Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 8 hours a week from Tuesdays and Thursdays.  That's a total of 9 + 8 = 17 hours a week.
* **For the whole semester:**  He has 17 hours a week for 16 weeks, so that's 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

**Answer:** 272

"Okay, so Bill bakes a bunch of rolls, croissants, and baguettes.  Let's figure out how long they are all together!

* **Rolls:** 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* **Croissants:** 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* **Baguettes:** 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add all those up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

Finally, we need to convert that to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, the answer is 280 feet!

"Okay, so the zookeeper needs to buy bananas for all the apes.  He buys 200 bananas for the monkeys, 400 for the gorillas, and 100 for the baboons each month.  To figure out how many bananas he needs for two months, we need to add up how many he buys each month.  That's 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.  Then, we need to multiply that by 2 because he needs it for two months.  So, he needs to buy 700 * 2 = 1400 bananas.

"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times, covering 100 yards each time, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, covering 40 yards each time, so she runs 34 * 40 = 1360 yards.  To find out who ran farther, we need to find the difference between their distances. Blake ran 1500 yards and Kelly ran 1360 yards, so Blake ran 1500 - 1360 = 140 yards farther than Kelly.

"Okay, so Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, 3 fewer seahorses, and 2 more clownfish.  

To find out how many fish they caught in total, we need to figure out how many of each type of fish they caught. 

* **Starfish:** Anakin caught 10, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
* **Seahorses:** Anakin caught 6, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses.
* **Clownfish:** Anakin caught 3, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish each person caught:

* Anakin caught 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.
* Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Finally, we add the number of fish each person caught to find the total number of fish they caught: 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

"Let's break this down!

*  We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. Let's say Brooke is ""B"" years old.  So Seth is ""2B"" years old.
*  In two years, their ages will add up to 28.  That means: (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28

Now we can solve for B:

* Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24
* Divide both sides by 3: B = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8 years old, we can find Seth's age:

* Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

**Answer: Seth is 16 years old.**

"If Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount, we can figure out how much Jimmy has. 

Twice Ethel's money is 2 * $8 = $16. 
Then Jimmy has $16 + $2 = $18. 

So the answer is $18.

"So, Pancho walks 20 miles a day, but on weekends he walks 10 miles.  To find out how many miles he walks in a week, we need to figure out how many days he walks and how many miles he walks on those days. 

* He walks 20 miles on weekdays, and there are 5 weekdays in a week.
* He walks 10 miles on weekends, and there are 2 weekends in a week.

So, he walks 20 miles * 5 days + 10 miles * 2 days = 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles in a week.

"Each uniform costs $150. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* The hat costs $25.
* The jacket costs three times the price of the hat, so it costs $25 * 3 = $75.
* The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket prices, so they cost ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.
* To find the total cost, we add up the prices of the hat, jacket, and pants: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

"Jake sees a total of 1210 legs. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* Spiders have 8 legs each, so 80 spiders times 8 legs each is 640 legs.
* Insects have 6 legs each, so 90 insects times 6 legs each is 540 legs.
* The rare mutant invertebrates have 10 legs each, so 3 of them times 10 legs each is 30 legs.
*  To find the total, we add all the legs together: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down:

* We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
* Since Sally Four is the same age, Sally Four is also 8 years old.
* Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so she's 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
* Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19 years old.
* Finally, the total age of all the birds is 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51 years.

So the answer is 51.

"Okay, so Jessica has student loans, a credit card, and a mortgage.  She wants to pay a little extra on top of the minimum payments. 

* **Minimums:**
    * Student loans: $300
    * Credit card: $200
    * Mortgage: $500
* **Total minimum:** $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 per month
* **Extra money:** She wants to pay 50% more, so that's $1000 * 0.50 = $500 extra each month.
* **Total she pays:** $1000 + $500 = $1500 per month
* **Yearly:** $1500 * 12 months = $18,000 per year 


So, Jessica pays $18,000 a year.

"It will take Billy a long time to peel and cut all those potatoes!  Here's how to figure it out:

* **Peeling:**  He needs to peel 60 potatoes, and it takes him 1.5 minutes per potato. So, that's 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes = 90 minutes.
* **Cutting:**  He needs to cut 60 potatoes, and it takes him 5 seconds per potato. So, that's 60 potatoes * 5 seconds = 300 seconds.
* **Total Time:**  To find the total time, we need to add the time for peeling and cutting. That's 90 minutes + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds. 

**Answer:** 5700 seconds

"Okay, so Zaid earns $6000 a month.  He spends some money on rent, gas, and then gives some to charity.  He also gives some money to his daughter and wife.  

Let's figure out how much money he has left.

* **Rent:** He spends 1/4 of his money on rent, which is $6000 * (1/4) = $1500.
* **Gas:** He spends 1/3 of his money on gas, which is $6000 * (1/3) = $2000.
* **Total spent:** He spends $1500 + $2000 = $3500.
* **Money left:** He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.
* **Charity:** He donates half of the remaining money, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.
* **Money after charity:** He has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.
* **Money for daughter and wife:** He gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700.
* **Final amount:** He has $1250 - $700 = $550 left.

"Okay, so Sandra wants her roses delivered, and she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.  She also got 200 pink calla lilies.  To figure out how many red roses she needs, we need to figure out how many white carnations she ordered.  We know she got 200 pink calla lilies, and those are five times the number of white carnations.  So, she ordered 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.  Now we know she ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, so she ordered 4 * 40 = 160 red roses.

"Okay, so the faster team is really good!  They're all super speedy.  

The less good team is a little slower.  The first runner is slow, then each person after that gets a little faster.  

To figure out how much faster they are, we need to add up the times for the less good team.  

* The first runner is 60 seconds.
* The second runner is 63 seconds.
* The third runner is 66 seconds.
* The fourth runner is 69 seconds.

That's a total of 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds.

Now, we need to figure out how much faster the faster team is.  The faster team is 55 seconds per person.  So, they run 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.

The faster team wins by 258 - 220 = 38 seconds!

"Okay, so Jerry's rolling a die, and we want to know how much more likely it is he'll get a number bigger than 3 than getting two even numbers in a row. 

* **Think about it like this:**  There are 3 numbers bigger than 3 (4, 5, 6) and 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6). 
* **The chance of getting a number bigger than 3 is 3 out of 6, which is 1/2 or 50%.**
* **The chance of getting two even numbers in a row is 3 out of 6 times 3 out of 6, which is 9 out of 36. That's 1/4 or 25%.**
* **To find the difference, we subtract the second chance from the first chance:** 50% - 25% = 25%.

**So, the answer is 25%.**

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Hamsters:** We know there are 10 hamster cages and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw. So, they have a total of 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.
* **Rats:** We know there are 160 pieces of straw used in total and we know the hamsters have 50 pieces. So, the rats have 160 - 50 = 110 pieces of straw.
* **Rats per cage:**  We need to figure out how many rats are in each cage.  We know each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, we divide the total straw for the rats by the number of rats: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.
* **Rats per cage:** Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, there are 18 rats in each cage.

"Mandy needs to pay Benedict $102.  Here's why:

* **Interest:**  They agreed to pay 2% interest each month.
* **Total Interest:**  Over 3 months, the interest is $2.
* **Total Amount:**  To find the total amount, we add the interest to the original amount: $100 + $2 = $102.

"Okay, so the trader bought the wheat for $20 per bag and had to pay $2 to get it to the warehouse.  He sold the wheat for $30 each.  He made a profit of $400.  To figure out how many bags he sold, we need to figure out how much money he made from selling the wheat. 

Let's think about it like this:

* He made $400 in profit.
* He sold the wheat for $30 each.
* He had to pay $2 to get the wheat to the warehouse.

To figure out how much money he made from selling the wheat, we need to figure out how much he made after paying for the wheat. 

Let's say he sold 'x' bags of wheat.  

* He made $30x from selling the wheat.
* He spent $22x on the wheat (20x + 2x).

So, we can write an equation:

$30x - $22x = $400

Let's solve for x:

$8x = $400

"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets, and then $4.50 less on food, so they spent $15.75 on food.  Then they went on two rides that cost $33 each, so that was $66 total.  To find out how much each person paid, we add up all the costs and then divide by 3.  That makes the total cost $102.00.  So, each person paid $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

"John collects 360 peaches. 🍑 
 
Here's how we figure that out:

"Here's how to figure out the answer:

* **Start with the flamingos on Friday:** Sue had 18 pink flamingos.
* **Take some away:** On Saturday, they took away 1/3 of the flamingos, which is 18 / 3 = 6.
* **Flamingos left:**  They had 18 - 6 = 12 flamingos left.
* **Add more on Sunday:** They added 18 more pink flamingos, so now they have 12 + 18 = 30 flamingos.
* **Find the difference:**  They had 30 pink flamingos and 12 white flamingos.  So, they had 30 - 12 = 18 more pink flamingos.

"Here's how to solve this:

* A pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser together.
* A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30.
* So, a pencil and eraser cost $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50
* Since a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser, a pen costs $1.50.
* If we want to know how much 8 pens cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8: $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

**Answer:** $12.00

"Okay, so Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.  She gets three times that amount in the first month, so she has 20 * 3 = 60 cards. Then, in the second month, she gets 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month, so she has 60 - 20 = 40 cards.  In the third month, she gets twice the number of cards from the first and second months, so she has 40 * 2 = 80 cards.  Finally, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 80 = 200 cards.  So, she has a total of 200 Pokemon cards.

"Okay, so John wins this award and gets a bonus.  He gets a $5000 bonus and then a raise of 5% of his regular pay.  He makes $2000 a week, and he works all year.  

To figure out how much he makes, we need to figure out how much his raise is.  A 5% raise means he gets 5% of his regular pay.  So, he gets $2000 * 0.05 = $100 extra each week.

Now, let's add that to his regular pay.  He makes $2000 + $100 = $2100 each week.

Finally, we need to figure out how much he makes in a year.  He makes $2100 every week, and there are 52 weeks in a year, so he makes $2100 * 52 = $11,000.

So, John makes $11,000 in a year!

"Okay, so Sara wants a jacket and shoes.  The jacket is $30 and each pair of shoes is $20.  She earns $5 for babysitting and $4 for mowing the lawn.  

To figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, let's see how much money she needs:

* The jacket and shoes cost $30 + ($20 * 2) = $70.
* She already has $10 saved.
* She needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.
* She earns $24 for each lawn mowing.
* She needs to mow the lawn $60 / $24 = 2.5 times. 

Since she can't mow half a lawn, she needs to mow the lawn **3** times.

"Let's break this down!

* **Let's use some letters to make it easier:**
    *  Let 'r' be the number of red chickens.
    *  Let 'w' be the number of white chickens.

* **We know:**
    *  The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day.
    *  The white chickens lay 5 eggs a day.
    *  Jerry collects 42 eggs in total.

* **We also know:**
    *  There are two more white chickens than red chickens.

* **Let's use the information to make equations:**
    *  3r + 5w = 42 (The total number of eggs)
    *  r = w + 2 (There are two more white chickens than red)

* **Now we can solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**
    *  Since we know 'r' is equal to 'w' plus 2, we can substitute that into the first equation: 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
    *  Simplify and solve for 'w': 3w + 6 + 5w = 42  
    *  8w + 6 = 42
    *  8w = 36

"To find out how long Gary walks, we need to figure out how long it takes him to walk the whole edge of the park. 

The park is a rectangle, so we can find the total distance by adding up the length and width. 

* Length: 1.5 miles
* Width: 6 miles
* Total distance: 1.5 miles + 6 miles = 7.5 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him, we divide the total distance by his speed.

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 7.5 miles / 3 miles per hour = 2.5 hours

So, Gary spends **2.5 hours** walking.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Sloane counted 100 people on the first day.
* The next day she counted 50 more than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 people.
*  She counted 500 people in total over the first two days.
*  To find out how many she counted on the third day, we subtract the total from the first two days from the total number of people she counted: 500 - 250 = 250 people.

**Answer:** 250

"Let's break this down!

* **Think about the problem:**  We know the pools are leaking, and we need to figure out how much water is in the small pool now.

* **Let's use some variables:**
   * Let 'x' be the amount of water in the small pool.
   * The big pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
   * Both pools lose 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
   * The big pool now has 4 times the amount of water as the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
   * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons. We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

* **Solve for x:**
   * 8x = 4(x - 16)
   * 8x = 4x - 64
   * 4x = -64
   * x = -16

* **The answer is not possible:**  We get a negative value for x, which means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way.


**Final answer:** There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and has to pay back more because she promised to pay 10% extra.  She's paying $165 a month for 12 months.  To figure out how much she'll owe after 12 months, we need to figure out how much she'll pay in total.  

Let's think about it like this:

* She's paying $165 a month, and that's for 12 months, so that's $165 * 12 = $2040.
* She also has to pay an extra 10% of the $2000 she borrowed, which is $2000 * 0.10 = $200.
* So, she'll pay a total of $2040 + $200 = $2240.
* But wait, she already paid $2040, so she'll have $2240 - $2040 = $200 left.


**Answer: $200**

"Okay, so we know Harriet is 21 years old.  Adrian is three times that, so he's 3 * 21 = 63 years old.  Zack is half of Adrian's age, so he's 63 / 2 = 31.5 years old.  

To find their average age in three years, we need to add three to each of their ages and then divide by 3.  That's (21 + 3 + 31.5) / 3 = 55.5 / 3 = 18.5 years old. 

**Answer: 18.5** 



"
"Okay, so we know Naomi scored 68 points.  Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is 34.  Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.  To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to figure out the total points for all the students.  We know the total is 251.  We can subtract the points that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored to find out how many points Jojo scored.  That's 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 104. 

**Answer:** Jojo scored 104 points.

"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.  To find out how many petunias he plants, we need to subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.  So, he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  Finally, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias.  That's 90 + 50 = 140 flowers. 

**Answer:** 140

"The company spent $15,000 on advertising one year and then spent a third of that amount the next year.  So, they spent $15,000 / 3 = $5,000 the second year.  To find the total amount spent, we add the two amounts: $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000. 

**Answer:** $20,000

"Okay, so Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour.  Carlos uses the boat for 3 hours and Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.  To find the total cost, we need to figure out how much Carlos pays and how much Benji pays. 

* Carlos pays $30 for 3 hours, so that's $30 * 3 = $90.
* Benji pays $18 for 5 hours, so that's $18 * 5 = $90.
*  In total, they pay $90 + $90 = $180.

"Okay, so James has 30 fire, 20 grass, and 40 water Pokemon.  He loses 8 of his water Pokemon and gets 14 more grass Pokemon.  To figure out the chance of picking a water Pokemon, we need to know how many water Pokemon he has left.  He has 32 water Pokemon left.  

To find the chance of picking a water Pokemon, we divide the number of water Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon.  That's 32 / 90.  

Rounding that to the nearest whole number, we get 36%.

"Chad's burrito cost $6.50 for the base burrito.  He added meat for $2.00, cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces for $0.25 each, which is $0.50.  He also got an upgrade for $3.00, which means he got chips and a drink.  

So, his total cost is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00.  He had a $5.00 gift card, so he only has to pay $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

"To figure out how long it takes them to finish the puzzle, we need to know how many pieces they can put together each minute. 

* Kalinda can put 4 pieces together per minute.
* Her mom can put half as many, so she puts 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces together per minute.

Now, we know they have 360 pieces.  To figure out how long it takes them to put them all together, we divide the total pieces by how many they put together each minute: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

That means it will take them 60 minutes to finish the puzzle.

"Okay, so the farm had 120 watermelons.  Ashlyn took some of them home, and then she went back a little later.  

* **First time:** She took 30% of the watermelons, which is 36.
* **After the first trip:** She had 84 left.
* **Second time:** She took 3/4 of the remaining watermelons, which is 63.

"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars for his company.  Each car costs $20,000.  He has to pay taxes on the cars, and then he has to pay $1000 for each car to register them.  How much does he spend in total?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Cost of the cars:** 12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000
* **Taxes:** $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000
* **Total cost before registration:** $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000
* **Total cost including registration:** $264,000 + $1000/car * 12 cars = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

**So, Mark spends $276,000 in total.**

"John has 54 candies.  To find out how many more candies he has than James, we need to figure out how many candies James has.  Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.  Finally, we can find the difference between John's candies and James' candies: 54 - 33 = 21.

"Okay, so we know there are snails in two aquariums.  Let's figure out how many fish are in each one.

*  The difference between the snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both. 
*  We know the difference is 28 snails. 
*  We also know that the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. 
*  So, we can say that 28 snails is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. 
*  Let's figure out how many fish are in each aquarium. 
*  We know that 28 snails is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. 
*  So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 28 / 2 = 14.

"Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 an hour. She works 6 hours a day for 4 days a week, so that's $250 * 6 * 4 = $6000 per week.  The movie takes 5 weeks, so she'll be paid $6000 * 5 = $30000.  Then, she gives Jean a 10% discount, so she pays $30000 - $3000 = $27000.

"Okay, so Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday and twice as many on Tuesday.  Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 on Tuesday.  

To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we can do this:

* Monday: 5 cookies * 4 = 20 cookies
* Tuesday: 13 cookies * 2 = 26 cookies
* Sue ate a total of 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

Now, we need to figure out how many calories Sue ate.  Each cookie has 200 calories.

* Sue's calories: 46 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories
* Her sister's calories: 18 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 3600 calories

Sue ate 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

"So, Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  The problem says the elevator takes him to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6.  Let's break it down:

*  He starts on the 3rd floor.
*  The problem says the elevator takes him to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 

To figure out his new floor, we need to do some math. 

*  Let's think of the starting floor as ""x"".
*  The problem says the new floor is 4 times ""x"" plus 6. 
*  So, the new floor is 4x + 6.

Now, we can solve for x. 

*  We know that the new floor is equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6. 
*  So, 4x + 6 = x 
*  Let's solve for x. 
*  Subtract x from both sides: 3x + 6 = 0
*  Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = -6
*  Divide both sides by 3: x = -2

So, Bill is on the **-2nd** floor.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Start with the total cows:** Mr. Sylas has 40 cows.
* **Cows per stall:** Each stall has 20 cows.
* **Number of stalls:** He has 10 stalls.
* **Cows per stall after buying:**  He divides the 40 cows equally among the 10 stalls, so each stall has 40/10 = 4 cows.
* **Cows in 8 stalls:**  He puts 4 cows in each of the 8 stalls, so there are 4 * 8 = 32 cows in 8 stalls.

"Okay, so the redwood is 200 feet tall.  Each section of the redwood is 10 feet long and weighs 400 pounds.  To find out how much the whole tree weighs, we need to figure out how many sections there are.  

The tree is 200 feet tall, and each section is 10 feet long, so there are 200 / 10 = 20 sections.

Now, we know each section weighs 400 pounds, so the whole tree weighs 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 80,000 pounds.

But wait! Termites ate some of the wood.  They ate 30% of the wood, which is 80,000 pounds * 0.30 = 24,000 pounds.

So, the redwood still has 80,000 pounds - 24,000 pounds = 56,000 pounds left. 


**Answer:** 56,000 pounds

"Nancy has to pay $6.00 for her overdue books.

"Carla needs 11 cups of flour. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Cookies:** She's making 36 cookies today and 30 tomorrow, for a total of 66 cookies.
* **Dozens:**  To figure out how much flour she needs, we need to know how many dozens of cookies she'll make.  
* **Flour per dozen:**  Two cups of flour make a dozen cookies.
* **Total flour:**  So, she'll need 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens of cookies.
* **Flour needed:**  Since each dozen needs 2 cups of flour, she'll need 5.5 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour.

"Okay, so we have 9,300 pennies in a cup.  To find out how much money we have in a stack with two-thirds of those pennies, we need to figure out how many pennies are in the stack. 

Two-thirds of 9,300 is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200 pennies.

Now, we know that each penny is worth $0.01.  So, to find the total amount, we multiply the number of pennies by the value of one penny: 6,200 pennies * $0.01/penny = $62.00

So the answer is $62.00

"The house costs $350,000.  There's also a fee for the person helping her buy the house, and another fee for transferring the house.  The fee for helping her buy the house is 5% of the house's price, which is $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500.  The fee for transferring the house is 12% of the house's price, which is $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.  So, the total cost is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.  Mrs. Cruz has $400,000 to spend, so the total cost is $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 more than her budget.

"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay some fees to make the sale happen.  He paid $12,000 for transfer fees and $20,000 for a brokerage fee.  Then he also had to pay $250,000 for the rest of the house.  To find out how much money Mr. Tan actually got from the sale, we need to subtract all the fees and the loan amount.  So, $400,000 - $12,000 - $20,000 - $250,000 = $100,000.  


**Answer:** $100,000

"Okay, so the oil takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees.  That means it takes 20 minutes * 1.40 = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.  Finally, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken after it's warmed up, so it takes 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes to cook.  So, the total time is 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes.

"Okay, so the sweater has a body, a collar, and a rosette.  The body takes 900 stitches. The collar is a tenth of that, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette is twice the size of the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.  The whole sweater has 1800 stitches.  To find out how many stitches are in each sleeve, we need to figure out how many stitches are left over after the body, collar, and rosette are made.  That's 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.  So, each sleeve has 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Mrs. Rylan bought a lot of seeds! She got 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds.  To figure out how much she spent, we need to know how much each kind of seed costs. Tomato seeds cost $40 each, and celery seeds cost $30 each.  

To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds. 

* Tomato seeds cost 20 packets * $40/packet = $800
* Celery seeds cost 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400
*  So, Mrs. Rylan spent $800 + $2400 = $3200 on seeds.

"Okay, so Sean has two scenes and a song.  

* The first scene has twice the lines of the song, which is 54 lines.
* He has a third of those lines, which is 54 lines / 3 = 18 lines.
* The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, which is 54 lines + 6 lines = 60 lines.
* He has four-fifths of those lines, which is 60 lines * (4/5) = 48 lines.

*  After taking out the A cards, she has 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.
*  Half of the remaining cards have the letter B, which is 48 * (1/2) = 24 cards.
*  That leaves 48 - 24 = 24 cards.
*  Five-eighths of the remaining cards have the letter C, which is 24 * (5/8) = 15 cards.

"Okay, so Matthew digs small holes in 3 minutes and big holes in 10 minutes.  

To find out how long it takes him to dig 30 small holes and 15 big holes, we need to figure out how long it takes him for each type of hole.

* **Small holes:** 30 small holes * 3 minutes/hole = 90 minutes
* **Big holes:** 15 big holes * 10 minutes/hole = 150 minutes

Now, we need to add up the time for both types of holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert that to hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Let's think about their ages:**
   * Let's say Mico is 'm' years old.
   * Let's say Marco is also 'm' years old.

* **We know they add up to 20:**
   *  m + m = 20

* **Solve for 'm':**
   * 2m = 20
   * m = 10

* **In 10 years, they'll be older:**
   * Mico will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old.
   * Marco will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old.

* **Their total age in 10 years will be:**
   * 20 + 20 = 40

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

*  Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.  That means if Sam is 'S' years old, Ruby is 6S years old.
* In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.  That means in 9 years, Ruby will be 3(S+9) years old.

Now we can set up an equation:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Let's solve for S:

* 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
* 3S = 18
* S = 6

So, Sam is 6 years old!

"Peter bought 20 popsicles for $0.25 each, and 4 ice cream bars for $0.50 each.  To find the total cost, we need to add up the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars. 

* Popsicles cost 20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00
* Ice cream bars cost 4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00
* The total cost is $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So the answer is $7.00.

"Okay, so we know a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half that amount, which is 35 spots.  

We also know there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.  To find the total number of spots, we just add up the spots on each snake: 

* Cobras: 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots
* Mambas: 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots
* Total spots: 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

Finally, to find half the total spots, we divide by 2: 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots

"Okay, so Alani, Braylen, and Margot each wrote stories in the first week.  They doubled the number of stories they wrote in the second week.

* Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
* Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

If you add all of their stories together, they wrote 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

"Okay, so we have a flag with 76 stars.  It has 3 rows of 8 stars, and then 2 rows of 6 stars.  To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we need to figure out how many stars are left over. 

We know there are 76 stars total, and we've already counted the stars in the first two rows.  That leaves us with 52 stars. 

We need to figure out how many rows of 5 stars are in the remaining stars.  We can do that by dividing the number of stars left over by the number of stars in each row of 5 stars. 

So, 52 stars / 5 stars/row = 10.4 rows.  Since we can't have a fraction of a row, there must be **5** rows of 5 stars.

"You need to figure out how many trucks you need to carry all the flagstones.  

* Each truck can carry 2000 pounds.
* You have 80 flagstones, and each one weighs 75 pounds.
* So, you need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight each truck can carry. 

Let's do the math: 5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks. 

Since you can't have half a truck, you'll need **3** trucks to carry all the flagstones.

"Okay, so we know the fast lane car is going 60 miles per hour.  The slow lane car is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  We want to know how long it took the slow lane car to travel 480 miles.

To figure that out, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.

So, we know the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour. Let's plug those in:

480 miles = 30 miles per hour * time

To find the time, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 30 miles per hour:

time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour

time = 16 hours

**Answer:** The slow lane car took **16 hours** to travel the same distance.

* **Chocolate for kids:**  The rest of the chocolate is for the kids, and there are 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars left.
* **Chocolate per kid:**  The kids get 16 chocolate bars divided by 8 kids, which is 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars per kid.

**Answer:** Each child gets 2 chocolate bars.

Let's add up the pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses for each day:

* **Day 1:** 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170
* **Day 2:** 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200

"The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day.  Two-thirds of them are sold in the morning, so that's 60 * (2/3) = 40 loaves.  

The rest of the bread is 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.  Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 loaves.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
* That means he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).
* Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight, so she needs to lose 2 pounds per week too.
* Since Sandy wants to lose the same amount as Joey, it will take her 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight. 


**Answer:** 4 weeks

"Okay, so we need to figure out how much we'll save! 

First, the ice cream is $11 now, which is $2 cheaper than the original $13 price.  That's a good deal!

We also need to know how much the milk costs before we can figure out how much we'll save on it. 

Let's say the milk costs $2.  Then, we'll need to figure out how much we'll save on the milk. 

To do that, we'll subtract the discount from the original price. 

**Can you tell me how much the milk costs?**

"Okay, so Theo wants to spend $6000 on his trip to South Africa.  He buys suits, suitcases, and a plane ticket.  

* **Suits:** He buys 6 suits for $100 each, so that's 6 * $100 = $600.
* **Suitcases:** He buys 3 suitcases for $50 each, so that's 3 * $50 = $150.
* **Plane ticket:**  The plane ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the price of a suit, which is 5 * $100 = $500. So, the plane ticket costs $500 + $700 = $1200.
* **Total cost:**  The total cost of everything is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350.
* **Money left:**  He has $6000 - $2350 = $3650 left.
* **Gifts:**  He wants to save $2000, so he has $3650 - $2000 = $1650 left for gifts.

**Answer:** $1650

"Okay, so Cera is 46 years old.  Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.  

To find out how old Noah was six years ago, we know that he was half Cera's age. So Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which is 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

So, the population of Chile now is 60,000 + 6 = 60,006.

"Let's break this down!

* We know the whole team has 105 players.
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense.
* The special teams have half as many players as the defense.

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of players on the defense.  

* The offense has 2x players.
* The special teams have x/2 players.

So, the total number of players is: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Now, let's solve for x:

* Combine the 'x' terms: (5/2)x = 105
* Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 5x = 210
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 42

**Answer:** There are 42 players on the defense.

"Okay, so the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.  To find out how much it costs to fill, we need to figure out how much space the pool takes up.  

The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet, so that's 6 * 4 = 24 square feet.  Then we need to multiply that by the depth, which is 5 feet.  So, 24 * 5 = 120 cubic feet.

Now, the cost is $0.10 per cubic foot, so we just multiply the volume by the price.  That's 120 * $0.10 = $12.00. 

**Answer:** $12.00

"Okay, so we know there are 30 boys in the classroom.  Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, there are 3 * 30 = 90 girls.  And since there are 1/10 as many non-gendered kids as boys, there are (1/10) * 30 = 3 non-gendered kids.  Finally, to find the total number of kids, we add up the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered kids: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 kids.

"Okay, so we know the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3.  That means for every pole, we need 3 wires.  We also know there are 45 wires in total.  

To figure out how many poles we need, we can think about it like this:

* If we have 45 wires, and each wire needs to be connected to a pole, we need to figure out how many times we need to use the ratio to get to the total number of wires.
* 45 wires / 3 = 15.  
* So, we need 15 * 1 = 15 poles.

"Okay, so there were 25 guys and 15 girls at the party to start.  After an hour, some people left.  We know 1/4 of the people left.  So, we need to figure out how many people left.  

To do that, we need to figure out how many people were at the party to begin with.  We know there were 25 guys and 15 girls, so there were 25 + 15 = 40 people at the party.

Now, we need to figure out how many people left.  We know 1/4 of the people left, so we need to figure out how many people left.  We can do that by multiplying the total number of people by 1/4.  So, 40 people * (1/4) = 10 people left.

Now, we need to figure out how many people are left.  We know 40 people - 10 people = 30 people are left.

Finally, we need to figure out how many girls are left.  We know there were 15 girls to start, and 10 people left, so we need to subtract the number of people who left from the number of girls.  So, 15 girls - 10 people = 5 girls are left.


**Answer:** 5 girls are left.

"To figure out how long it takes to fully charge, we need to figure out how much charge the phone needs to gain.  

The phone is at 60% charged, and it needs to get to 100%. That means it needs to gain 40% more charge.

Now, the phone charges 1% every 3 minutes.  To get 40% more charge, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

Finally, we need to convert that to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes is equal to 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

"Okay, so we need to figure out which job pays more. 

* **Job A:**  It pays $15 an hour, and you work 2000 hours a year. That's a total of $15 * 2000 = $30,000.  Then, the government takes 20% of that, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So, after taxes, you get $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

* **Job B:** This job pays $42,000 a year. But, it also has property taxes of $6,000.  After that, they take 10% of the rest, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.  So, after taxes, you get $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

So, Job B pays $32,400, and Job A pays $24,000.  The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400. 

**Answer:** Job B pays more.

"Okay, so Maria buys 8 shares of stock for $8 each.  That's a total of $8 * 8 = $64.  The stock goes up 50% the first year, so it's now worth $64 + ($64 * 0.50) = $96. Then, the stock goes down 25% the second year, so it's now worth $96 - ($96 * 0.25) = $72. 

So the final value of all her shares is $72.

"Okay, so Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times that amount, which is 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.  John ate half of what Thomas ate, so he ate 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.  To find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract: 3 - 2 = 1.

"Okay, so we have 200 students in total.  The problem says the groups are equal, so we need to figure out how many are in each of those groups.  

Let's think about it like this:

* The groups are equal, so we know there are 2 groups with the same number of students.
* The last group is smaller, and it's 10 less than each of the other groups. 

To find out how many are in the last group, we need to figure out how many are in the other groups. 

Let's say the other groups have 'x' students each.  

* The total number of students in the other groups is 2x.
* The last group has x - 10 students.

Now we can set up an equation: 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Let's solve for x:

* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

So, each of the other groups has 70 students.  The last group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals.  He has twice as many chickens as cows.  Let's figure out how many of each animal there are.

*  Let's say there are 'c' chickens.
*  Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, there are 'c' cows.

Now we know:
*  c + c = 60 (The total number of animals)
*  c = 2c (Twice as many chickens as cows)

Let's solve for 'c' and 'c':

*  2c = 60
*  c = 30 

So, there are 30 chickens. 

Now we know there are 30 chickens and 30 cows. 

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so there are 30 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 60 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so there are 30 cows * 4 legs/cow = 120 legs.

The total number of legs is 60 + 120 = 180 legs.

"Okay, so the pink frog is 50 pounds.  The blue beetle is the same weight as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.  The green toad is the same weight as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.  The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the pink frog, so it's 50 pounds + 10 pounds = 60 pounds.  The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the pink frog, so it's 50 pounds - 20 pounds = 30 pounds.  The total weight of everything is 20 pounds (the container) + 50 pounds (frog) + 50 pounds (beetle) + 50 pounds (toad) + 60 pounds (snake) + 30 pounds (bird) = 290 pounds.

"Okay, so Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A, which costs $4.  Then Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, which costs $4.  To find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we need to subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C.  So, Juice Box C is $11 and Juice Box B is $9. The difference is $11 - $9 = $2. 

**Answer:** $2 
"
"Okay, so we have 40 tables with 4 legs each and 50 tables with 3 legs each.  

To find the total number of legs, we need to do a little math. 

* 40 tables * 4 legs/table = 160 legs
* 50 tables * 3 legs/table = 150 legs

Now, add those together: 160 legs + 150 legs = 310 legs

So the answer is 310.

"Davos bought two shirts that cost $30 each.  He got a 40% discount, so he saved money!  To figure out how much he paid, we need to figure out how much the shirts cost before the discount.  

* **Step 1: Find the total cost of the shirts.** 
   * 2 shirts * $30/shirt = $60

* **Step 2: Calculate the discount.**
   * $60 * 0.40 = $24

* **Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original price.**
   * $60 - $24 = $36

Davos paid $36 for the two shirts.

"Okay, so Morgan wants to have a birthday party and she has $90.  She wants to do mini-golf, go-karts, and the arcade.  Here's how we can figure out how many friends she can invite:

* **Mini-golf:**  Mini-golf costs $5 per person.  Let's say she wants to invite 'x' friends.  That means the cost of mini-golf is 5x dollars.
* **Go-karts:**  Go-karts cost $10 each. She wants to go twice, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.
* **Total:**  To figure out how much she has left, we need to subtract the cost of mini-golf and go-karts from her total budget.

**Let's see how many friends she can invite:**

* **Total cost:** $5x + $20
* **Total budget:** $90

**We need to find the value of 'x' that makes the total cost equal to her budget.**

"Marisa gets $5 a day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops that cost 25 cents each, so that's $1.00.  She saves the change, which is $4.00.  If she saves for 5 days, she'll have $20.00 in her piggy bank. 

**Answer:** $20.00

"Okay, so Billy has $10 and wants to buy candy.  He buys candy that costs $1.50 per pound.  He also buys gumballs that cost $0.05 each.  He buys 40 gumballs.  How many pounds of candy did he buy?

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Figure out how much money Billy has left after buying the gumballs:**  He has $10.00 - $0.20 = $9.80 left.
* **Divide the money he has left by the price of candy per pound:** $9.80 / $1.50 = 6.53 pounds.

**Answer:** Billy bought approximately 6.53 pounds of candy.

"Carver is 45 years old.  Twice his age is 2 * 45 = 90.  Five years less than twice his age is 90 - 5 = 85.  So, Carver's son is 85 - 45 = 40 years old. 


**Answer: 40**

"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles from city one to city two, then 100 miles from city two to city three, and then 50 miles less than that to go from city three to city one.  That's a total of 225 miles for one trip.  The train does this trip three times a day.  To figure out how many days it takes for the train to need a service, we need to know how many miles it travels in total.  The train travels 675 miles in a day.  The train needs a service every 18,000 miles.  So, we divide the total miles traveled by the service distance.  That's 18,000 miles / 675 miles = 26.67 days.  Rounding that to the nearest whole number, it takes the train **27 days** to need a service.

"Okay, so Mark makes dog beds.  He makes a bed for a Rottweiler that needs 8 pounds of stuffing, a bed for a chihuahua that needs 2 pounds, and a collie bed needs the average of those two.  

To figure out how much stuffing he needs for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds, we need to figure out how much stuffing each collie bed needs. The average of 2 and 8 is 5 pounds.

Then we need to figure out how much stuffing he needs for the chihuahua beds. 4 chihuahua beds need 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

Finally, we need to figure out how much stuffing he needs for the collie beds. 3 collie beds need 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

So, in total, he needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

"Okay, so John drives 200 miles to his friend's house.  He drives at 70 mph.  Then he takes a detour that's 10 miles longer, so he's driving for a bit longer.  After that, he goes home on a 240-mile route at 80 mph.  How long did the whole trip take?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **To get to his friend's house:**  He drives for 200 miles at 70 mph, so that takes him 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours.
* **The detour:**  He adds 10 miles to his trip, so he's driving for 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours.
* **Back home:** He drives 240 miles at 80 mph, so that takes him 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

**To find the total time, we add all the times together:** 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours.

**So the answer is 6.00 hours.**

"There are 96 students at Small Tree School.  43 of them are girls.  5 girls and 4 boys were absent on Friday.  To find out how many boys were at school on Friday, we need to figure out how many boys there were in total.  We know there are 96 students total, and 43 are girls, so there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  5 of those boys were absent, so there are 53 - 5 = 48 boys at school on Friday. 

**Answer:** 48

"If there are 6 girls in the park, and there are twice as many boys, we need to figure out how many boys there are.  Since there are twice as many boys as girls, there are 6 girls * 2 = 12 boys.  Finally, we add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids in the park.  So there are 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids in the park. 

**Answer:** 18

"Jane needs to get at least 9 more points on her third test to pass.  

**Answer:** 9 
"
"Okay, so we know 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks, and then 4 times that number minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  That means 3 * 4 = 12 people were kicked out for not wearing masks.  Then, 12 - 5 = 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.  Finally, 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence, which is 3 * 7 = 21 people.  To find out how many people were kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the other people from the total number of people kicked out.  So, 50 total people - 12 (mask refusal) - 7 (shoplifting) - 21 (physical violence) = 10 people.

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to give out the awards!

First, we need to figure out how much each frame costs.  It costs $20 for the frame itself. Then, we need to add 20% extra for the etching.  That means each frame costs $20 + ($20 * 0.20) = $24.  

Next, we need to figure out how much it costs to get the pins.  Two seniors get pins, and each pin costs $5, so that's $5 * 2 = $10.

Then, we need to figure out how much it costs to get the cords.  One-fourth of the seniors are officers, and each officer gets a cord for $12.  So, that's $12 * (1/4) * 44 = $132.

Finally, we add up all the costs: $24 * 44 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

**Answer:** $1198

"Okay, so the wallpaper costs $400.  But if Ethan makes it himself, he saves 20% of the price.  That means he'll save $80.  So, to figure out how much it costs to make it himself, we take the original price and subtract the savings: $400 - $80 = $320.  

**Answer:** $320

* Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
* To find the total, we add up the pesos Axel and Anna have: 50 + 80 + 100 + 120 = 350 pesos.

"Okay, so Millie makes lemonade and wants to make some money.  She needs $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher has 12 cups.  She sells each cup for $1.  She sells 4 cups of lemonade every hour.  

To figure out how much money she makes, we need to figure out how many cups she sells in an hour.  She sells 4 cups per hour.  She sells 4 cups/hour * 36 cups = 144 cups of lemonade.  

Then, she makes $144 from selling the lemonade.  She spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $144 - $18 = $126. 

So, Millie makes $126 per hour.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

We know Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares of land left after selling some.  We also know he had 3/5 of his land, which is a fraction, so we need to figure out what the whole amount was.

Let's say he had 'x' hectares of land at first.  

* He sold 3/5 of his land, which is (3/5)x hectares.
* He has 12.8 hectares left, so (1 - 3/5)x = 12.8

Now we can solve for x! 

* (2/5)x = 12.8
* Multiply both sides by (5/2): x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* Calculate: x = 32 hectares

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Think about the ratio:** The ratio 5:6 means Betty has 5 parts and Sam has 6 parts of popsicles.
* **Find the total parts:**  They have a total of 5 + 6 = 11 parts.
* **Find the value of one part:**  They have 165 popsicles total, so one part is 165 / 11 = 15 popsicles.
* **Find how many Betty has:** Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
* **Find how many Sam has:** Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.
* **Find the difference:** Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Okay, so Carol writes a song for 4 hours, then records it for half that time, which is 2 hours.  She also spends 90 minutes editing.  To figure out what percentage of her time she spent editing, we need to do a few things.

First, let's convert the editing time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is equal to 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time she spent: 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours.

Finally, we can find the percentage of time spent editing by dividing the editing time by the total time and multiplying by 100%: (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = 20%.

So the answer is 20%.

"To figure out how many days Mark needs to save, we need to divide the cost of the bike by how much he earns each day. 

* Bike cost: $300
* Money Mark earns per day: $10

Mark needs to save for **30 days**.

"Okay, so Nancy found 90 spiders.  To find out how many millipedes she saw, we need to figure out 1/3 of that number.  That's like saying 90 / 3 = 30 millipedes.  

Then, she found twice the number of millipedes minus 12 stink bugs.  That means she found 30 * 2 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Finally, to find the total number of bugs, we add up all the bugs she found: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 162 bugs. 


**Answer:** 162

"Okay, so Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of power every hour.  He uses it for 8 hours a day.  If he uses it for 3 hours less each day, how much less energy will he use in 30 days?

**Here's how to figure that out:**

* **Daily energy use:** 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours
* **Reduced daily energy use:** 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours
* **Energy saved each day:** 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours
* **Total energy saved in 30 days:** 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours
* **Convert to kilowatt-hours:** 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kWh

**So, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of energy in 30 days.**

"Okay, so we have 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, and one zebra with 36 stripes.  Then there's another zebra with half as many stripes as the first one.  To find the total number of stripes, we just add them all up.  That's 2 * 17 + 36 + 18 = 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.  To find the average, we divide the total stripes by the number of zebras: 88 stripes / 3 zebras = 29.33 stripes per zebra.

"Okay, so Tyson wants to make muffaletta sandwiches for the game.  He needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese for each sandwich, and he's making enough for 20 people.  

* **Meat:** He needs 5 pounds of meat because 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.
* **Cheese:** He also needs 5 pounds of cheese.
* **Cost:** The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00.
* **Cheese:** The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00.
* **Total:**  The total cost is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"Okay, so Sally went to the seashore and got $10.  She bought some taffy, seashells, and magnets.  Here's how much she spent:

* **Taffy:**  She got 2 pounds of taffy, and it was on sale.  The sale was 1/2 off, so she got $1.50 off.  That means she paid $4.50 for the taffy.
* **Seashells:** She bought a bag of seashells for $1.50.
* **Magnets:** She bought 4 magnets, and they were $0.25 each, so that was $1.00.

Now let's add up all the costs: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

Finally, we subtract the total cost from her starting money: $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00

**Answer:** Sally has $3.00 left.

"Okay, so Tim buys two packs of fireworks, one for $400 and another one that's twice as much, which is $800.  Then he gets a 20% discount on everything.  Finally, he buys a special firework for $150.  

To figure out how much he spent, we need to do a few things:

1. **Calculate the cost of the second pack:**  The second pack is twice as expensive as the first pack, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.
2. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**  The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.
3. **Calculate the discount:**  The discount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.
4. **Calculate the final cost after the discount:**  After the discount, Tim spends $1200 - $240 = $960.
5. **Calculate the total cost including the finale:**  The total cost including the finale firework is $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"Let's break this down!

* **Joanne's apples from shortest trees:**  Joanne gathers half the apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  She gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister, and we know her sister gathers 3 times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne.
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:** 45 + x + 60 = 500
* **Solve for x:** x = 500 - 45 - 60 = 405

"Okay, so we have a herd of camels and dromedaries.  We know there are 180 heads in total, and we also know there are 304 bumps.  

To figure out how many dromedaries there are, we need to use some math.  

* **Heads:**  We know camels and dromedaries have different numbers of heads.  
* **Bumps:**  We know camels have two bumps each, and dromedaries have one.

Let's think about how we can use this information to find the number of dromedaries. 

**Here's what we can do:**

1. **Think about the total number of heads:**  We know there are 180 heads in total.

"Let's break this down!

* Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
* Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
* To find out how big Zack's locker is, we need to figure out how many times bigger Peter's locker is than Zack's. 
* Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's. So, Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker.
* Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's locker, so Zack's locker is 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches.
* Now we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.
* Timothy's locker is half the size of Zack's locker, so Timothy's locker is 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

**Answer:** Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"Oliver needs to climb 7,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb. 

Here's why:

* Stanley's comb is 10,000 feet high.
* Oliver is 3,000 feet high.
* To get to Stanley's comb, Oliver needs to climb the difference in height, which is 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet.

"Mr. Josue got money from two banks. The first bank gave him $4000, and the second bank gave him twice that amount.  So, the second bank gave him $4000 * 2 = $8000.  He started with $5000, and he got $4000 + $8000 = $12000.  So, he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000 now. 

**Answer:** $17000

"Okay, so first, four boats took away 20 cats.  That leaves 30 cats. Then, 18 of them ran off after a mouse.  So, how many are left?  

**Answer:** 12

"Okay, so Bill gets a deal for the first six months, then it goes up.  He pays $8 a month for six months, that's $8 * 6 = $48. Then it goes to $12 a month for two months, so that's $12 * 2 = $24.  Then it goes up to $14 a month for six months, so that's $14 * 6 = $84.  So, the total cost for 8 months is $48 + $24 + $84 = $156.  To figure out the cost for two years, we need to know how many months are in two years.  There are 12 months in a year, so two years is 2 * 12 = 24 months.  So, the total cost for two years is $156 * 2 = $312.

"Okay, so Cole wants new jeans for a dance contest. He finds two kinds: tattered jeans and jogger jeans.  They're on sale, so he buys both! 

The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less.  He saved $6 in total.  

To figure out how much the jogger jeans originally cost, we need to figure out how much he saved from the jogger jeans.  He saved $6, and that's 1/3 of the total savings.  So, he saved $6 / 3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.

The tattered jeans cost $28, and he saved $4 from those.  

The jogger jeans cost $18, and the tattered jeans cost $28.  The difference is $28 - $18 = $10. 


**Answer:** $10 
"
"Okay, so we have 4 buses that hold 60 people each, 6 minivans that hold 30 people each, and 10 minivans that hold 15 people each.  

To find the total number of people, we need to add up the people from each type of vehicle. 

* Buses: 4 buses * 60 people/bus = 240 people
* Minivans: 6 minivans * 30 people/minivan = 180 people
* Minivans: 10 minivans * 15 people/minivan = 150 people

Now, let's add all those numbers together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people

So, a total of 570 people can go on the trip! 


**Answer:** 570

"Lillian has 3 feeders she made herself and 3 she bought.  Each of the store-bought feeders has 20 birds on them.  The homemade feeders have 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they have 20 + 10 = 30 birds.  In total, she has 3 + 3 = 6 feeders.  If all the birds stay, she'll have 20 + 30 = 50 birds. 

**Answer:** 50

"Okay, so Aleksandra got soup, a bagel, and a cake. The bagel cost $4.  The soup cost 25% more than the bagel, so it cost $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5. The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it cost $4 / 2 = $2.  So, the total cost is $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

"Kenny needs $100 to go to the amusement park. He wants to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.50 each.  He has to make enough money to cover the ticket.  Let's figure out how many cards he needs to sell.

* **Think about it:** If he sells each card for $1.50, he can make $1.50 * x dollars, where 'x' is the number of cards he has.
* **He has $50:**  He has $50 to spend on the ticket. 
* **The answer:** To figure out how many cards he needs to sell, we need to figure out how many times $1.50 will equal $100. 
 
  * $100 / $1.50 = 66.67 
  * Since he can't sell parts of cards, he needs to sell 67 cards. 



**Answer:** 67

"Okay, so there were 36 guests, and the caterer made enough hot dogs for half of them to have two.  That means 18 guests got two hot dogs.  Since 40 people showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog, 22 people didn't get one.

"Let's break it down!

* Indras' name has 6 letters.
* Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name. 
* Half of Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.
* Her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

So, Indras' name has 6 letters and her sister's name has 7 letters. 


**Answer:** 6 + 7 = 13

"Okay, so Charlotte wants pots and pans, bowls, and some utensils.  Let's figure out how much that costs!

* Pots and pans: $120.00
* Bowls: $20.00
* Utensils: 5 utensils * $5.00/utensil = $25.00

That's a total of $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

The store is having a sale, so everything is 20% off!  That means she gets to save $33.00.

The final price is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

"Okay, so Josey has 15 gallons of gas and wants to put it into 5 containers.  If she needs 1/4 of a container, how many pints does she need? 

Here's how to figure that out:

* **Think about the size of each container:**  Each container holds 3 gallons.
* **Figure out how much gas she uses:** She needs 1/4 of a container, which is 3 gallons / 4 = 0.75 gallons.
* **Convert gallons to pints:**  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, she needs 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

**Answer:** 6 pints 
"
"Okay, so George spent $5 and got 1% of his money left.  That means he had $0.05 left.  He spent $4.95 on candy bars.  To figure out how many candy bars he bought, we need to divide the money he spent on candy bars by the price of each candy bar.  That gives us 6.6 candy bars.  Since you can't buy parts of candy bars, he bought **6** candy bars.

"Okay, so Antoine wants to make a big pot of soup! He needs twice as many onions as the recipe calls for, so that's 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds.  He's making soup for 6 people, so we need to figure out how much it costs.  The onions are $2.00 a pound, so he'll spend $2.00 * 4 pounds = $8.00 on onions.  He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are $2.00 each, so that'll cost him $2.00 * 2 boxes = $4.00.  The total cost is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.  That means each person will pay $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per serving.

"Okay, so we know the area of Billie's room is 360 square feet.  We also know the length is 3 yards, which is equal to 9 feet.  To find the perimeter, we need to know the width.  We can use the area formula: area = length * width.  So, 360 = 9 * width.  Solving for width, we get 40 feet.  Now, to find the perimeter, we use the formula: perimeter = 2 * (length + width).  So, perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet. 


**Answer:** 98 
"
"Okay, so Elizabeth has 60 beads and Margareth has 140 beads.  To find out how many more beads Margareth has, we need to subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads.

"Okay, so Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.  He bakes for 3 hours, and that makes it 40 + 900 = 940 degrees. Then he opens the window for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.  The window cools it down by 3 degrees for every 10 minutes, so it cools down by 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 degrees.  The final temperature is 940 - 1.5 = 938.5 degrees. 

**Answer: 938.5** 
"
"Okay, so Jon finishes the triathlon in 160 minutes.  James is 10% faster in the swim, so he finishes his swim in 40 * 1.10 = 44 minutes.  James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so he takes 70 + 5 = 75 minutes.  

To find out how long James takes to run, we need to figure out how much time he takes compared to Jon.  Jon takes 160 minutes, and James wins by 10 minutes, so James takes 160 - 10 = 150 minutes. 

James takes 150 minutes to run.

"Here's how to solve this:

* Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day.
* They eat apples for 30 days.

"Okay, so Bob has 10 raised beds, and each one is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.  That means each bed needs 32 cubic feet of soil.  He needs to buy enough soil for all 10 beds, so that's 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.  Each bag of soil holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags of soil.  Finally, 160 bags cost $12 each, so the total cost is 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920. 


**Answer:** $1920 
"
"Okay, so we know there are 15 red cards.  They want to know how many green cards there are, and we know they're 60% more than the red cards.  So, 60% of 15 is 9.  That means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.  And since the yellow cards are the same as the red and green cards combined, there are 24 yellow cards.  Finally, we add all the colors together: 15 + 9 + 24 = 48 cards. 

**Answer:** 48

"Okay, so we have Jennifer's puppies with 3 spots and Brandon's puppies with 4 spots.  That's a total of 7 puppies with spots.  And together they have 20 puppies.  To figure out what percentage of puppies have spots, we need to divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100.  That's (7/20) * 100 = 35%. 

So the answer is 35%. 
"
"Okay, so the farmer needs to buy hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes for his horses.  Let's figure out how many trips he needs to make to get all the feed.

* **Hay:** He buys 42 bales of hay, and each bale is 75 pounds. So, that's 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds of hay.
* **Oats:** He buys 20 sacks of oats, and each sack is 65 pounds. That's 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds of oats.
* **Sugar cubes:** He buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, and each box is 1 pound. That's 2 * 1 = 2 pounds of sugar cubes.
* **Carrots:** He buys 4 bags of carrots, and each bag is 12 pounds. That's 4 * 12 = 48 pounds of carrots.

Now, let's add up all the weight of the feed: 3150 + 1300 + 2 + 48 = 4500 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, he needs to make **2** trips to carry all the feed.

"
"Here's how to figure out who paid more:

* **Becky:** She bought 20 apples for $0.45 each, so that's 20 * $0.45 = $9.00. Then she got a $1 discount, so she paid $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.
* **Kelly:** She bought 20 apples for $0.50 each, so that's 20 * $0.50 = $10.00. She got a 10% discount, which is 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00. So she paid $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

To find out who paid more, we subtract Becky's price from Kelly's price: $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00. 

**Answer:** Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

"Okay, so Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen.  She paid $10.  To figure out how much change she got, we need to figure out the total cost.  The pen cost $2, and three times that is $6.  One less than that is $5.  So the paper cost $5.  The total cost is $2 + $5 = $7.  Then, she got $10 - $7 = $3 in change. 

**Answer:** $3

"Okay, so we have 30 students and they start with 10 pencils each.  After two months, they use some pencils, and then we're left with some pencils.  

Let's figure out how many pencils they had left.  

* **Step 1:**  They use 1/5 of the pencils, which is 30 students * 10 pencils/student / 5 = 6 pencils.
* **Step 2:**  They have 30 students * 10 pencils/student - 6 pencils = 294 pencils left.
* **Step 3:**  They have 1/3 of the pencils left, which is 294 pencils / 3 = 98 pencils.

So, they have **98** pencils left.

"Okay, so Matt wants cookies but his dad wants him to eat healthy.  He says he can have half as many cookies as carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room.  If Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, how many carrot sticks does he need to eat? 

Here's how to figure it out:

* Let's say Matt eats 'x' number of carrot sticks.
* He gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. 
* So, the cookies he gets are 0.5x + 2.
* He wants to eat 5 cookies in total.

We can write this as an equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
* Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks. 


**Answer:** 6

"Okay, so Benny saw a shark that was 10 feet long.  Now, imagine there were two remoras, each 6 inches long, attached to the shark.  To figure out what percentage of the shark's body is taken up by the remoras, we need to figure out how much longer the remoras are than the shark's body.

The remoras are 72 inches long in total.  The shark is 120 inches long.  So, the remoras are 72 inches out of 120 inches.  

To figure out what percentage that is, we can do this: 72 inches / 120 inches * 100% = 60% 

So the answer is 60%.

"If 3/4 of the students have a desktop computer, that means 1/4 of the students don't.  We know 20 students don't have computers.  So, we can figure out how many students there are by thinking about the total number of students.  

Let's say there are 'x' students in total.  We know that 3/4 of the students have computers, so we can write that as (3/4)x.  We also know that 1/4 of the students don't have computers, so we can write that as (1/4)x.  We know that (3/4)x - 20 = (1/4)x.  Let's solve for x.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Start with the total kids:** There are 32 kids in Gina's class.
* **Kids allergic to something:**  Nine kids are allergic to dairy, six are allergic to peanuts, and three are allergic to both. 
* **Kids not allergic:**  To find out how many kids aren't allergic, we need to subtract the number of kids who are allergic from the total number of kids. 

So, 32 - 18 = 14 kids aren't allergic.

"Okay, so Tom's wife's anniversary trip is going to be pretty expensive! 

* Plane tickets cost $5000 each, so that's $5000 * 2 = $10000 for both.
* The hotel is more expensive on the weekend, so it costs $1500/day * 20% more = $300 extra per day.
* That means the weekend hotel is $1500/day + $300/day = $1800/day.
* They'll be there for 3 days, so the hotel will cost $1800/day * 3 days = $5400.
* The whole trip will cost $10000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15400. 

So the trip costs $15400.

* **Oats for 5 days:** He needs 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds of oats.
* **Bags needed:**  He has 200 pounds of oats, and each bag has 50 pounds, so he needs 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

"Okay, so we have 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one is 60 inches tall.  We need to figure out how tall the pyramid is.  

First, we know the bottom row is 4 cheerleaders tall, and they are all 64 inches.  So that's 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

Then, the next row has 3 cheerleaders, and they are also 64 inches tall.  That's 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The next row has 2 cheerleaders, and they are also 64 inches tall.  That's 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

Now, we add all the heights together: 256 + 192 + 128 = 576 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet.  576 inches is equal to 576 / 12 inches per foot = 48 feet.

So the answer is 48 feet.

"Okay, so Paul drives his car twice a day, morning and afternoon, for 14 days.  That's a lot of driving!

* **Afternoon:** He also drives in the afternoon, and it costs $2 each time. He does this for 14 days, so he spends $2 * 28 = $56 on afternoon rides.
* **Total:**  To find the total, we add the cost of morning rides and afternoon rides: $168 + $56 = $224. 

So, Paul spent $224 on driving his car in those 14 days.

"Okay, so Mark has to pick a place for his wife's party.  He has two choices:

* **Option 1:**  It costs $200 no matter how many people come.
* **Option 2:** It costs $25 per person.

Here's the catch: Option 1 doesn't include food, but Option 2 does.  

To figure out how many people he needs to make the two places the same price, we need to figure out when the cost is the same. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Option 1:**  $200 + $5 * number of people
* **Option 2:** $25 * number of people

We want to find out how many people make the two options the same.  

Let's set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5 * number of people = $25 * number of people

Now we can solve for the number of people:

$200 = $20 * number of people

Divide both sides by $20:

number of people = 10 


So, Mark needs 10 people to make the two places the same price!

"Let's break this down!

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' be the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:**  The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

"Okay, so Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein and Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.  To find the total, we need to add those amounts together.  

* **Step 1: Find the total yarn used.**
   *  Think of it like this: 1/4 + 1/2 = ? 
   *  To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.
   *  So, 1/4 is the same as 1/4 * 1 = 1/4
   *  Now we have 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4
   
* **Step 2:  Multiply the total yarn by the number of yards per skein.**
   *  We know there are 364 yards in a skein.
   *  So, 3/4 * 364 yards/skein = 273 yards

**Answer:** 273

"Okay, so Suzie bought four packs of gum. She got two packs of strawberry gum, and she paid $2 for each pack of grape gum.  She also bought a pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum.  

To figure out how much each pack of strawberry gum cost, we need to figure out how much she spent on the other gum.  She spent $7 total, and $2 for the grape gum.  So, she spent $7 - $2 = $5 on the other gum.

She bought two packs of strawberry gum, so each pack cost $5 / 2 = $2.50.

"Okay, so Frederick wants to make popsicles and he's trying to save money. He needs popsicle sticks, and he's got a budget.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2x4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2x8 piece.  He needs to figure out which wood is the cheapest to buy so he can make the most popsicles.

He knows that a 2x4 costs $4 and a 2x8 costs $6.  He has $24 to spend on wood. 

Let's see which one is the best deal:

* **2x4:**  $4 for 200 sticks. That's $0.02 per stick.
* **2x8:** $6 for 400 sticks. That's $0.015 per stick.

The 2x4 is cheaper, so he should buy that!

To figure out how many 2x4 pieces he can buy, we divide his money by the price of each piece: $24 / $4 = 6 pieces.

Now, he can make popsicles with 6 pieces of 2x4, and that's going to give him a lot of sticks! 


**Answer:** 1200 sticks

"Okay, so Mario has 6 dogs, and each dog needs a pair of snowshoes.  Since each pair costs $12, we need to figure out how many pairs he needs.  

He has 6 dogs, and each dog needs 2 legs, so he needs 6 dogs / 2 legs per pair = 3 pairs of snowshoes.

Finally, 3 pairs of snowshoes cost $12.00 per pair * 3 pairs = $36.00.

"Okay, so the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so they have 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so they have 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  To find the total, we add up the number of animals at the farm and the zoo: 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  So, the total number of animals is 40 + 80 = 120.

"Okay, so Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  To figure out how many onions Sophia bought, we need to think about how many times Rose bought more than Sophia.  Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia did.  So, Sophia bought 12 / 4 = 3 onions.  

Now, we know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions, so Sophia bought 4 - 3 = 1 potato.

Finally, to find the total, we add the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought: 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 onions and potatoes.

"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th.  He needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound.  To figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we need to figure out how many days he has left. 

He has 211 days left to lose the weight.  So, he needs to burn 105,000 calories total.  

To figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 211 days = 500 calories per day.

"
"Okay, so the house and the lot cost $120,000 together.  The house is three times more expensive than the lot.  To find out how much the house costs, we need to figure out how much the lot costs first. 

Let's think about it like this:

*  If the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can say the house is 3 times the price of the lot. 
*  We know the total cost is $120,000. 

Let's use that information to solve for the price of the lot. 

*  We can write an equation:  Lot + House = $120,000
*  We know the house is 3 times the lot, so we can write that as: Lot + 3 * Lot = $120,000
*  Combine the lots: 4 * Lot = $120,000
*  Divide both sides by 4 to find the price of the lot: Lot = $30,000
*  The house costs three times the lot, so the house costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000


**Answer:** $90,000

"Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags. That's a total of 8 * 5 = 40 bags. She sold each bag for $8. So, she sold 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

* **Hats:** 3 kids * 1 hat/kid = 3 hats
* **Scarves:** 3 kids * 4 scarves/kid = 12 scarves
* **Sweaters:** 3 kids * 12 sweaters/kid = 36 sweaters
* **Mittens:** 3 kids * 1 mitten/kid = 3 mittens
* **Socks:** 3 kids * 2 socks/kid = 6 socks

Now, let's add up how many skeins she needs: 3 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 58 skeins

"To figure out how many rows Jackson can plant, we need to think about how many of each color he can fit in a row. 

* **Red tulips:** He can fit 6 red tulips in a row.
* **Blue tulips:** He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row.

He has 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips.  Let's see how many rows he can make with each color:

* **Red tulips:** 36 red tulips / 6 red tulips per row = 6 rows
* **Blue tulips:** 24 blue tulips / 8 blue tulips per row = 3 rows

Since he can only plant a certain number of rows of each color, we need to find the smaller number.  The smaller number is 3.

"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity per hour.  Then she gets a new device that uses 2 kilowatts per hour.  That means her total electricity use goes up.  

To figure out how much her electricity bill will be, we need to know how much she uses each week.  She uses 12 kilowatts per hour, and there are 7 days in a week, so she uses 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per week.

Now, each kilowatt costs $1.50.  So, her weekly bill is 84 * $1.50 = $126.00.

But wait!  The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour, so her total use is 14 kilowatts per hour.  That means her weekly bill is 14 * $1.50 = $21.00.

So, the difference in her weekly bill is $126.00 - $21.00 = $105.00.

"Okay, so the bus starts with 48 people.  Eight people get off, and then 5 times the number who left get on.  That means 5 * 8 = 40 people get on.  So now there are 48 - 8 + 40 = 70 people.  Then, 21 people get off, and 3 times fewer people get on.  That means 3 * 21 / 3 = 21 people get on.  So, there are 70 - 21 + 21 = 70 people left on the bus. 


**Answer:** 70 
"
"Okay, so we know Jame is 22 years old now.  In 8 years, his cousin will be 39 years old.  To find the age difference, we can subtract Jame's age from his cousin's age in 8 years.  That's 39 - 22 = 17 years.  

The question asks for the age difference *now*, so we need to subtract the 5 years Jame has left until he turns 27.  That's 17 - 5 = 12 years.

"Okay, so Errol bought a computer for $1,100, and a printer for $700 less than that.  That means the printer cost $700.  The total cost of the computer, printer, and monitors was $2,400.  To find out how much the monitors cost, we can subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost.  That gives us $2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600.  Since there are two monitors, each one cost $600 / 2 = $300. 


**Answer:** $300 
"
"Okay, so the boys brought 60 shells each, and there were two groups. That means they brought a total of 60 * 2 = 120 shells.  The girls brought 120 + (4 * 60) = 120 + 240 = 360 shells.  To find out how many shells each girl brought, we divide the total shells by the number of girls: 360 / 10 = 36 shells. 

**Answer:** 36

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Chenny is 10 years old.
* Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so she is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.

So the answer is 8. 
"
"Okay, so we have four books. The first one is 31 mm thick. The second one is 50 mm thick. The third one is 5 mm less than the second one, so it's 45 mm thick. And the fourth one is twice as thick as the first one, which is 62 mm. 

To find the total thickness, we just add all the thicknesses together: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm. 

So the answer is 188.

"Okay, so the problem is about how much money the eldest boy has after some stuff happens. 

* **Start:** The boys have $18 to share, so each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.
* **Eldest's money:** The eldest boy gets $6 + $5 = $11. Then he adds another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21.
* **Spending:** He spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.
* **Triple it:** He triples his remaining money, which is $13 * 3 = $39. 

So, the eldest boy has $39 now.

"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 for the whole month.  He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.  To figure out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, let's break it down.

* **First half:** He needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the first half.
* **Second half:** He wants to save twice as much in the second half, so he needs to save $562.50 * 2 = $1125.
* **Daily savings:** To figure out how much he saves each day in the second half, we divide the total savings by the number of days in the second half: $1125 / 15 days = $75 per day.

"Okay, so we know Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets.  Let's figure out how much Brad gets first. 

If they split $100, and Jeff gets 4 times what Brad gets, we can figure out how much Brad gets by dividing the total money by 4. 

So, Brad gets $100 / 4 = $25. 

Now, Jeff gets 4 times that amount, so he gets $25 * 4 = $100. 


**Answer:** $100

"Okay, so Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month.  That means he lost a total of 30 pounds.  To find out his starting weight, we need to figure out how much he weighed before he got sick.  We know his final weight was 70 pounds, so we can subtract the weight he lost to find his starting weight.  

70 pounds - 30 pounds = 40 pounds. 

So, Mark's initial weight was 40 pounds.

"Okay, so Daniel wants to buy some school stuff.  He needs five notebooks, two pens, one calculator, and one geometry set.  The shop gives him a 10% discount on everything.  

First, let's figure out how much everything costs:

* Notebooks: 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50
* Pens: 2 pens * $0.25/pen = $0.50
* Calculator: $12.00
* Geometry set: $10.00

Now, let's add up the cost of everything before the discount: $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

The shop gives him a 10% discount, so he'll pay $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

"Here's how to solve this:

* Shiloh will be 51 years old in 7 years.
* In 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. 
* Let's say his nephew is 'x' years old now. 
* In 7 years, his nephew will be x + 7 years old.
* So, 3*(x + 7) = 51

Now we can solve for x:
* 3x + 21 = 51
* 3x = 30
* x = 10

So, his nephew is 10 years old today.

"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals.  That's 45 more than Anna.  To find out how many Anna scored, we need to subtract 45 from Richie's score: 80 - 45 = 35.

To find the total, we add up all the goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175. 

So the answer is 175.

"Okay, so the food truck sells grilled cheese sandwiches.  They need bread, cheese, and condiments.  They buy bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches.  They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.  How much money do they make?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Cost of bread:** They need $3.00 for each loaf of bread, and they make 10 sandwiches with each loaf. So, each sandwich costs $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.
* **Cost of cheese and condiments:** They spend $30.00 for 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.
* **Total cost:**  They spend $0.30 per sandwich on bread and $3.00 on cheese and condiments, so they spend $0.30 * 10 = $3.00 on all the sandwiches.
* **Total money they make:** They sell each sandwich for $7.00, and they sell 10 sandwiches, so they make $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.
* **Profit:**  They make $70.00 and spend $3.00, so they make a profit of $70.00 - $3.00 = $67.00.

"Okay, so Michael's getting new carpet for his bedroom.  

First, we need to figure out how much the carpet itself will cost.  He's getting 18 feet by 12 feet of carpet, so that's 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.  The carpet costs $12 per square foot, so that's 216 * 12 = $2592.

Then, he needs padding, which costs $2 per square foot, so that's 216 * 2 = $432.

Next, the contractor charges $4 per square foot to take out the old carpet, so that's 216 * 4 = $864.

Finally, the installer charges $34 per square foot to put down the new carpet, so that's 216 * 34 = $7456.

So, the total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7456 = $11344.

"Okay, so the oven is 18 degrees too hot.  To figure out what temperature to set it to for the recipe, we need to figure out how much hotter it needs to be.  

The recipe calls for 520 degrees, and the oven is 468 degrees.  We need to add 20.8 degrees to the current temperature to get the right temperature. 

So, the oven needs to be set to 488.8 degrees.

"Okay, so Max wants to watch two movies.  The first one is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is like 90 minutes.  The second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is 125 minutes.  To find the total time, we just add those up: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.  So the answer is 215 minutes.

"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000.  Juan's house is 30% less expensive, so we need to figure out how much Juan's house costs.  

To do that, we need to find 30% of $76,000.  That's like taking 30 out of every 100 dollars.  So, 30% of $76,000 is (30/100) * $76,000 = $22,800.

Now, we subtract that amount from Herb's price to find Juan's house price: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Finally, to find the total price of both houses, we just add their prices: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200. 


**Answer:** $129,200

"Okay, so Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, so she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.  Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.  Together they brought 12 + 24 = 36 cups and 40 + 60 = 100 dishes.  So, the total number of utensils they brought is 36 + 100 = 136. 

**Answer:** 136

"Okay, so the jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans.  The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue.  

Let's think about this:

* **Let's say there are 'b' jelly beans that are blue.** 
* **Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, there are 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans as red.**
* **And since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, there are 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans as green.**

Now, we know the total number of jelly beans is 4500.  Let's put it all together:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

**To solve for 'b', we can combine the 'b' terms:**

2.99b = 4500

**Now, divide both sides by 2.99 to find the number of blue jelly beans:**

b = 1500

**Finally, to find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we can use the information about the percentages:**

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

**So, the jar has 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.**

"Okay, so Jared's typing speed went up a little bit each time.  He started at 47 words per minute and then got to 52.  If he keeps going, he'll be at 57.  To find the average, we need to add all his speeds and then divide by 3.  So, 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Then, 156 / 3 = 52.  So the answer is 52.

"If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week.  

To find the difference in his weight after 5 weeks, we need to figure out how much he'll lose with Cheerios and how much he'll gain with donuts.

* Cheerios: 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds
* Donuts: 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

The difference is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds. 

**Answer:** 2.5

"Alex has 100 people coming from her email invites, and each of them is bringing 2 friends. That's 100 * 2 = 200 people.  Then, she calls 10 friends, and 8 of them are bringing their spouses. That's 10 * 8 = 80 people.  So, in total, there are 200 + 80 = 280 people coming to the event. 

**Answer:** 280

"Okay, so we know the first dog is a little Affenpinscher, and he weighs 10 pounds.  The next dog is a Dachshund, and it's twice as heavy as the Affenpinscher, so it weighs 20 pounds.  Then there's a Papillon next to the Dachshund, and it's only a quarter of the Dachshund's weight, which is 5 pounds.  Finally, the last dog is a Mastiff, and it's 44 times heavier than the Papillon, which is 220 pounds. 

So the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* The beanstalk doubles in height each day.
* It starts at 4 feet.
* To be taller than the window, we need to find the day when it reaches 20 feet.

Let's think about the beanstalk's growth:

* Day 1: 4 feet
* Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
* Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
* Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
* Day 5: 32 * 2 = 64 feet
* Day 6: 64 * 2 = 128 feet
* Day 7: 128 * 2 = 256 feet

It will take **7 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Okay, so John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day.  Each cup of mushrooms has 3 grams of protein.  To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we need to figure out how many grams of protein he eats in a day.  So, he eats 200 grams of mushrooms, and each cup has 3 grams of protein, so he gets 200 grams * 3 grams/cup = 600 grams of protein a day.  Then, to find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply that by 7 days in a week, so he gets 600 grams/day * 7 days/week = 4200 grams of protein in a week. 

**Answer:** 4200

"Let's think about this!  Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  That means if he's currently 'x' years old, five years ago he was 'x-5' years old.  

We know that twice the age from five years ago is equal to Jerry's current age. So we can write an equation: 2(x-5) = x. 

Let's solve for x:

* 2x - 10 = x
* 2x - x = 10
* x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. In three years, he'll be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"Okay, so George needs to pay for two implants, and each one costs $2000.  Then he wants a crown for one of them, which costs an extra $500.  That makes the total cost of the implants $2000 + $500 = $2500.  He already paid $600, so he still needs to pay $2500 - $600 = $1900.  To figure out how many hours he needs to work, we need to know how much he makes per hour. He makes $15 per hour.  So, he needs to work $1900 / $15 per hour = 126.67 hours.

"Okay, so we know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's think about the angles in terms of how many times they are bigger or smaller than each other.

*  Let's say the smallest angle is 'x'. 
*  The other two angles are:
    * Twice the smallest: 2x
    * Three times the smallest: 3x

Now, we know that all three angles have to add up to 180 degrees. So, we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Let's solve for x:

* Combine the 'x' terms: 6x = 180
* Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The largest angle is three times the smallest, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"Colby has a lot of money!  He has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies.  Let's see how many gumballs he can buy. 

* **Quarters:** 8 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $2.00
* **Dimes:** 6 dimes * $0.10/dime = $0.60
* **Nickels:** 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
* **Pennies:** 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15
* **Total money:** $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45
* **Gumballs:** $3.45 / $0.05/gumball = 69 gumballs

**Answer:** 69

"Okay, so we have 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds.  

* Dogs have 4 legs each, so 5 dogs times 4 legs is 20 legs.
* Cats have 4 legs each, so 2 cats times 4 legs is 8 legs.
* Birds have 2 legs each, so 10 birds times 2 legs is 20 legs.

That's a total of 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs! 


**Answer:** 48

"To figure out how long it takes to travel 2000 miles, we need to know how fast the plane is going.  

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so it goes 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

To travel 2000 miles, it will take 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours. 


**Answer:** 5 hours

"Okay, so Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.  Marissa makes 3/4 of that amount in one hour.  If they both work for 12 hours, how much chocolate did they make together?

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Find how much Ruiz makes in one hour:** Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, so he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour.
* **Find how much Marissa makes in one hour:** Marissa makes 3/4 of Ruiz's amount, so she makes (3/4) * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour.
* **Find their total production:**  They make 60 pounds/hour + 45 pounds/hour = 105 pounds per hour.
* **Calculate their total production in 12 hours:** They make 105 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds.

**Answer:** 1260

"Okay, so Howard goes to the arcade.  He spends $8 on Monday.  On Tuesday, he spends twice as much, so he spends $8 * 2 = $16.  Then on Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as Tuesday, so he spends $16 * 4 = $64.  In total, he spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.  He started with $100, so he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **We know the jumbo bottle costs $24.00 and lasts for 120 washes.**
* **Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.**
* **To find out how much each pump costs, we need to figure out how much it costs for 1 pump.**

**To do that, we can divide the total cost by the number of pumps:**

$24.00 / 120 pumps = $0.20 per pump

**Now, we need to convert that to cents:**

$0.20 is equal to 20 cents. 


**Answer:** 20 cents

"Okay, so Joe has $50 to spend on a new outfit.  There's a sale where everything is 30% off.  The shirt costs $25, and the shorts cost $35.  

To figure out how much he'll have left, we need to figure out the total cost of the outfit.  The shirt is $25, and the shorts are $35, so that's $25 + $35 = $60.

Now, we need to figure out how much the sale is going to cost.  The sale is 30% off, so we need to figure out how much that is.  That's $60 * 0.30 = $18.

So, the total cost of the outfit is $60 - $18 = $42.

Finally, we need to figure out how much sales tax will be.  Let's say the sales tax is 6%.  That means the sales tax will be $42 * 0.06 = $2.52.

So, the final price of the outfit is $42 + $2.52 = $44.52.

**Answer:** $44.52

"Okay, so Monica's street is 150 meters long and it costs $194 to repave each meter.  Lewis's street is 490 meters long.  To find out how much it costs to repave Lewis's street, we just multiply the cost per meter by the length of the street.  So, Lewis's street would cost $194 * 490 = $95,660.  To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis's street than Monica's, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis's street.  That's $95,660 - $29,100 = $66,560.

"Okay, so John starts with $100,000 and then gets more money each month.  He gets 50% more money each month after the first 5 months.  

To figure out how much it costs, we need to know how many months he works on the project.  He works for 25 months in total.

Here's how to figure out the total cost:

* **First 5 months:** $100,000
* **Extra money each month:** $50,000
* **Total cost:** $100,000 + ($50,000 * 25 months) 

Let's calculate that:

* $100,000 + $1,250,000 = $1,350,000

So, John's research cost $1,350,000. 



**Answer:** $1,350,000

"Okay, so Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water.  He pays $0.15 per gallon.  To figure out how much he spends on water in a year, we need to do a few things:

1. **Calculate weekly cost:**  He uses 20 gallons/load * $0.15/gallon = $3.00 per week.
2. **Calculate yearly cost:** He does laundry twice a week, so he spends $3.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $156.00 per year.

So, Gary spends $156.00 on water for laundry in a year.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Scarlett spent!

* **Rocks:** She bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.00
* **Coral:** She got 3 pieces of coral for $2.00 each, so that's 3 * $2.00 = $6.00
* **Fish:** She bought 20 fish for $0.50 each, so that's 20 * $0.50 = $10.00
* **Fish food:** She spent $2.00 on fish food.

Now, let's add all those up: $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $23.00

So, Scarlett spent $23.00 in total.

"It will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from the bull. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Meat per day:** Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour, and he works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg of meat each day.
* **Bull's weight:** The bull weighs 750 kg.
* **Days to sell the meat:**  To find out how many days it will take to sell the whole bull, we divide the bull's weight by the amount of meat Prince sells each day: 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.

"Okay, so a diamond is $2000.  The gold is 4/5 of that, which is $2000 * (4/5) = $1600.  The silver is $400 less than the gold, so it's $1600 - $400 = $1200.  Finally, the total price is $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800. 

**Answer:** $4800

"To figure out how long it takes Tom to catch up, we need to know how much ground Tom needs to cover.  

* Bob is 75 miles ahead, so Tom needs to drive 75 miles to catch up.
* Tom is driving 70 miles per hour, so it will take him 75 miles / 70 miles per hour = 1.07 hours to catch up. 

**Answer:** It will take Tom about 1.07 hours to catch up.

"Manny can miss **10** classes. 

Here's why:

* He has 10 classes total.
* His parents will only pay if the total cost is less than $10 per class.
* If he misses 10 classes, the total cost will be $100. 
* $100 is more than $10 per class.

"Okay, so Jewel works 50 customers a day. Julie is twice as fast, so she works 100 customers a day.  

To find the total customers they work in a week, we need to multiply their daily work by the number of days in a week. 

Julie works 7 days a week, so she does 700 customers. Jewel works 7 days a week, so she does 350 customers.

Finally, to find the total, we add their work: 700 + 350 = 1050 customers. 


**Answer:** 1050

"Lynn ran 17 miles. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* Paisley ran 4 miles.
* Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
* Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles. 



"
"Okay, so we know apples cost $1.30 each and oranges cost $1.10 each.  

To find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges cost, we need to do a little math. 

* 5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50
* 5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50

So, 5 apples and 5 oranges cost $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00 


**Answer:** $12.00

"To figure out how long it takes Bob to dig the hole, we need to know how much time it takes him to move one cubic foot of dirt.  

*  He shovels 3 seconds for every cubic foot. 
*  The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. 
*  To find the total time, we multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes to shovel one cubic foot. 

**Answer:** 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds.

"The truck costs $30,000 to start.  Then, there are some extra things you can get for it.  The king cab is $7,500 extra.  Leather seats are a third of that price, so they cost $2,500.  Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,000.  The upgraded lights cost $1,500.  So, all those extras cost $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500.  The total cost of the truck is $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.

"Okay, so Tim gets a raise!  That's awesome!  He gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 a month salary.  That means he gets $20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000 extra each month.  Then, he gets a bonus that's half his salary, which is $20,000 / 2 = $10,000.  So, his new salary is $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000.  That's a lot of money!  To figure out how much he makes in a year, we just multiply his new salary by 12 months.  That's $21,000 * 12 = $252,000.  So, Tim makes $252,000 a year!

"Okay, so Alisa biked for 4.5 hours at 12 miles per hour.  That's 4.5 * 12 = 54 miles.  Stanley biked for 2.5 hours at 10 miles per hour, which is 2.5 * 10 = 25 miles.  To find the total distance, we just add those up: 54 + 25 = 79 miles.  So the answer is 79.

"Okay, so Bill wants to dig a well.  He can dig through soil really fast, but it's slower in clay.  

* He digs 4 feet of soil per hour.
* He digs half as fast in clay, so he digs 2 feet per hour in clay.

He needs to dig 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay.

* To find out how long it takes him to dig the soil, we divide the total soil he needs to dig by his digging speed: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

* To find out how long it takes him to dig the clay, we divide the total clay he needs to dig by his clay digging speed: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

* To find the total time, we add the time it takes to dig the soil and the time it takes to dig the clay: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"Okay, so Clara bought pomegranates on Tuesday for $20 each, and she got a $2 discount, so they cost her $18 each.  Then, the price went up to $30 on Wednesday.  She bought 20 more pomegranates on Wednesday, and they were $30 each.  

To find the difference in price, we need to figure out how much she paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday.  She paid $30 * 20 = $600.  Then, she got a 10% discount, so she paid $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference in price is $540 - $360 = $180.

"Okay, so James bought a plane for $150,000.  He has to pay $5000 a month to keep it in a hangar.  He also spends twice as much on fuel each month as that.  To figure out how much it costs him to own the plane for a whole year, we need to figure out his monthly costs and then multiply that by 12. 

So, he spends $5000 on the hangar and $10,000 on fuel each month. That's a total of $15,000 a month.  

To find out how much it costs him in a year, we multiply that by 12 months.  That's $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

"Let's break this down!

We know Lee has sheep and geese on his farm.  We know the total number of legs is 70, and the total number of heads is 20.  

To figure out how many sheep there are, we can use a little bit of math. 

* **Let's use 's' to represent the number of sheep.**
* **Let's use 'g' to represent the number of geese.**

We can write two equations:

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20 (Total heads)

Now, we can solve for 's' (the number of sheep).  

One way to do this is to use a little trick.  We can solve Equation 2 for 'g':

* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20
* **Subtract 's' from both sides:** g = 20 - s

Now, we can plug this value of 'g' into Equation 1:

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Let's solve for 's':

* **Simplify:** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70
* **Combine like terms:** 2s + 40 = 70
* **Subtract 40 from both sides:** 2s = 30
* **Divide both sides by 2:** s = 15

So, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm!

"Okay, so Roger wants coffee and a donut.  The regular coffee is $5 a pound, and he got a more expensive one that's 20% more expensive.  He needs a pound of coffee every day for a week.  How much did it all cost?

* **a) $42**
* **b) $44**
* **c) $5** 

Let's figure it out! 

The more expensive coffee is $6 a pound.  He needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week, so that's $6 * 7 = $42.  He also buys a donut for $2.  So, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44. 


**Answer: b) $44**

"Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00.  How much did the apple pie cost?

Here's how to figure that out:

* Chips cost $2.00 * 2 = $4.00
* The total cost of the food is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00
*  The apple pie cost $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So the apple pie cost $7.00.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

We know Janey has 3 more books than twice the number Sally has.  We also know Janey has 21 books.  Let's use that information to figure out how many books Sally has.

* Let's say Sally has 'x' books.
* Twice the number of books Sally has is 2x.
* Janey has 3 more than twice Sally's books, so she has 2x + 3.

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can write an equation: 2x + 3 = 21

Now we can solve for x:

* Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books!

"Karen earns twice as much as Lorie, so she makes $20 per hour.  She works 3 hours a day, so she makes $20 * 3 = $60 each day. Over two days, she makes $60 * 2 = $120.

"If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can figure out how many hash browns you can make with 96 potatoes by thinking about how many potatoes make hash browns. 

Here's how:

* **Think about the ratio:**  We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 
* **Set up a proportion:**  Let's say 'x' is the number of hash browns you can make with 96 potatoes. We can write this as a proportion: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns
* **Solve for x:**  To find 'x', we need to figure out what number goes in the 'x' spot to make the equation work.  We can do that by cross-multiplying: 6 * x = 36 * 96.  Then, we can solve for 'x' by dividing both sides by 6. 
* **The answer:**  x = 576 

So, you can make 576 hash browns with 96 potatoes. 


**Answer:** 576

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Max's cookies:** We know Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies. So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.
* **Cookie Monster's cookies:** Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
* **Summer's cookies:** Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.
* **Total cookies:** To find the total, add up the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 96 = 237 cookies.

**Answer:** 237

"Okay, so Shania wants to make her dress longer.  She makes it 50% longer, which means she adds half of its original length.  Then she adds 20cm of lace.  We know the final dress is 140cm long.  Let's figure out how long it was originally. 

Think about it like this:

*  Let's say the original dress was 'x' centimeters long.
*  She makes it 50% longer, so it's 1.5 times the original length.
*  That means the extended dress is 1.5x centimeters long.
*  We know the extended dress is 140cm long. 

So, we can set up an equation: 1.5x = 140cm

Let's solve for x:

* Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 140cm / 1.5 
*  That means x = 93.33cm. 


**Answer:** The dress was approximately 93.33cm long originally.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Turtle mode:** Chris mows his whole lawn in 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.
* **Rabbit mode:** He mows his whole lawn in 40 minutes.
* **Half and half:**  He mows half his lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode.
* **Total time:**  To find the total time, we need to add the time for each mode. 

**Answer:** 60 minutes

"Okay, so Catherine buys apples for $4, bananas for $2 per kilo, and oranges for $3 per kilo.  

* Apples: $4
* Bananas: 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4
* Oranges: 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6

To find the total, we add up the cost of each item: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So the answer is $14.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle! 

We know there are twins and triplets. One twin is older than one triplet.  The total age of the twins and triplets is 44.  

Let's use some simple math to figure it out. 

* **Let's say the twin's age is 't'.**
* **The triplet's age is '3t' (because there are three of them).**

Now, we can write an equation:

* **t + 3t = 44**

Let's solve for 't':

* **4t = 44**
* **t = 44 / 4**
* **t = 11**

So, one of the twins is 11 years old!

"Okay, so Manolo bought 5 lollipops and 4 candies for $3.20.  Each lollipop costs $0.40, so 5 lollipops cost $0.40 * 5 = $2.00.  The candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.  If he buys 10 lollipops, that'll be $0.40 * 10 = $4.00.  And 10 candies will cost $1.20 * 10 = $12.00.  So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4.00 + $12.00 = $16.00.

"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins each month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than that.  To find out how many coins Neil saves, we need to figure out how much more he saves than Rong. 

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins each month.  So, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month.

To find out how much they save in total over 10 years, we need to multiply their monthly savings by the number of months in 10 years. Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins. Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Finally, we add their savings together: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins. 

So, after 10 years, they'll have a total of 5760 coins.

"Okay, so John needs two vaccines that cost $20 each, so that's $20 * 2 = $40.  Then, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which is $125.  So, the heartworm check costs $125 * 0.60 = $75.  The total cost is $40 + $75 = $115.  So, John leaves with $125 - $115 = $10.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how much the crate of fruit costs. 

* **Bananas:** They cost twice as much as apples, and apples cost $0.50 each. So, bananas cost $0.50 * 2 = $1.00 each.
* **Oranges:** They cost three times as much as bananas, which cost $1.00. So, oranges cost $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each.
* **Total cost:** We have 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.  
    * Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
    * Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
    * Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00
* **Total price:** $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00

**So, the crate of fruit costs $32.00.**

"Mia needs 13 more chairs.  Here's why:

* She has 40 regular chairs.
* She has 15 baby chairs.
* She needs to have enough chairs for 42 adults and 15 babies.
* 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people
* She needs 57 people to be seated.
* She needs 57 - 42 = 15 more chairs.

"Okay, so we know there are 50 deer in the field.  Half of them are bucks, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bucks.  Then, 20% of the bucks are 8-point bucks.  To find out how many of those are 8-point, we multiply the number of bucks by 20%.  That's 25 * 0.20 = 5 bucks. 

So the answer is 5.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip. 

* Adam got 50 points.
* Betty got 30% more than Adam, so she got 50 + (30/100 * 50) = 65 points.
* Marta got 3 times more than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. So, Marta got 3 * (65 - 30) = 135 points.
* Together, they have 50 + 65 + 135 = 250 points.
* To go on the trip, they need 400 points.
* So, they are missing 400 - 250 = 150 points.

"Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Fireworks from the display:**  She sees 40% of the fireworks from the display, so she sees 300 fireworks * 0.40 = 120 fireworks.
* **Fireworks in her backyard:** She also has 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard, and each box has 5 fireworks, so she has 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks.
* **Total fireworks:**  To find the total, we add the fireworks from the display and her backyard: 120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks.

"Okay, so Gissela's truck can carry 4000 pounds. Gordy's truck can carry 800 more than that, so it can carry 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds.  Together, they can carry 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.  To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the amount they already carry from the total amount: 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.  So, Gary's truck can carry 2800 pounds.

"Alex charges $12 per day for tutoring, and she tutors for two weeks. So, she charges $12 * 7 days/week * 2 weeks = $168.

"Okay, so the factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream every 4 hours.  To find out how much they make in 48 hours, we need to figure out how many 4-hour chunks are in 48 hours.  That's 48 hours / 4 hours per chunk = 12 chunks.

Now, we know they make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream every 4 hours, so in 12 chunks, they'll make 50 quarts/chunk * 12 chunks = 600 quarts.

Finally, we need to add that to the chocolate ice cream.  They make 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream every 2 hours.  In 48 hours, they'll make 100 quarts/2 hours * 24 hours = 1200 quarts.

So, the total amount of ice cream they make in 48 hours is 1200 quarts + 600 quarts = 1800 quarts.

"Okay, so Marcus bought croissants, cinnamon rolls, mini quiches, and blueberry muffins.  Let's figure out how much that costs!

* Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00/croissant = $15.00
* Cinnamon Rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50/cinnamon roll = $10.00
* Mini Quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00/mini quiche = $12.00
* Blueberry Muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00/muffin = $13.00

Now, let's add all those up: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

But wait! Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount.  So, we need to take off 10% of the total cost.  That's $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

So, Marcus' total bill is $36.00.

"Okay, so Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy and eats 4 pieces a day. Amy starts with 100 pieces and eats 3 pieces a day.  

To figure out how much more candy Amy has, we need to see how much candy Amy eats in two weeks.  

* Amy eats 3 pieces a day * 14 days = 42 pieces. 
* Ginger eats 4 pieces a day * 14 days = 56 pieces. 
* Amy has 42 pieces - 56 pieces = -14 pieces. 

So, Amy has -14 pieces of candy after two weeks.

"Okay, so James went blueberry picking.  He had to pay $20 to get there and then $1.50 per pound.  He picked 30 pounds of blueberries.  To figure out how much he saved, we need to see how much it would have cost him at the store.  The store sells blueberries for $2.50 per pound.  So, he would have spent 30 pounds * $2.50/pound = $75 at the store.  He spent $65 picking them himself.  He saved $75 - $65 = $10.

"Okay, so the company wanted to buy 500 computers and they had $700 for each one.  But then they found out the price went up 10%!  

To figure out how much they paid, we need to figure out the new price of each computer.  

* 10% of $700 is like taking 10 out of every 100 dollars. So, that's (10/100) * $700 = $70.
* Now, we add that extra $70 to the original price of $700. That makes the new price $700 + $70 = $770.
* Finally, we multiply that new price by the number of computers they want to buy, which is 500. That gives us $770 * 500 = $385,000. 

So, the company paid $385,000 for all the computers.

* Erasers cost $0.25 each, so 8 erasers cost 8 * $0.25 = $2.00
* The total cost is $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00
* You paid $10.00, so you got $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00 in change.

"Okay, so Helga is really good at dancing!  She can tap her feet really fast.  

* **With her arms up:** She taps 200 times per minute with each foot.
* **With her arms down:** She taps 300 times per minute with her right foot and 250 times per minute with her left foot.

She dances for 5 minutes, and her arms are up for only 2 of those minutes.  

To find out how many times she taps her feet, we need to figure out how many times she taps in each of the 5 minutes.

* **Taps with arms up:** She taps 200 times per minute * 2 minutes = 400 times.
* **Taps with arms down:** She taps 550 times per minute * 5 minutes = 2750 times.

**Total taps:** 400 + 2750 = 3150 times.

"Ron is in a tough spot!  He's got a pothole that's going to cost his car $450 to fix.  The city says he can't fix it himself, and if he does, he'll get a fine.  He also has to buy some asphalt, and it costs $25 for each bucket.  

So, how much would he save if he fixes it?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Asphalt cost:** He needs 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25, so that's 3 * $25 = $75.
* **Total cost to fix it:**  The fine is $120, and the asphalt is $75, so that's $120 + $75 = $195.
* **Savings:** If he fixes it, he'll spend $195, but the pothole could cost him $450.  So, he'd lose $450 - $195 = -$255. 


**Answer:** Ron would lose $255.

*  The other three friends ate 3/4 of their pizza, which is 15 slices.
*  So, 10 slices + 15 slices = 25 slices were eaten.
*  That leaves 60 slices - 25 slices = 35 slices.

"Okay, so the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same amount of sausages in half the time the cat takes.  To figure out how long it takes the dog, we need to think about how long it takes the dog to eat the same amount of sausages. 

The dog eats in 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so it takes 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.

Now, to find the total time, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes. That's 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Finally, to find the average time, we divide the total time by the number of animals. So, the average time is 50 minutes / 2 animals = 25 minutes.

"Let's break this down!

* Topher's shoes are 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoes. 
* We know Topher's shoes are 100 inches long.
* Let's figure out how long Bobby's shoes are.

**Think about it like this:**

*  If we know Topher's shoes are 100 inches long, and 9 times Bobby's shoes is the starting point, we can figure out how much longer Topher's shoes are. 

**Let's solve it:**

* 9 times Bobby's shoes is 9 * x, where x is the length of Bobby's shoes.
* We know that 9 times Bobby's shoes plus 10 inches equals Topher's shoes. 
* So, 9x + 10 = 100

**Now we can solve for x:**

* Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 90
* Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

**Answer:** Bobby's shoes are 10 inches long.

"Okay, so we know candidate A got 20% of the votes.  Candidate B got 50% more than that, which is 20% + 10% = 30%.  That means A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.  So, the rest of the votes must have gone to candidate C.  Since there are 100 voters, and they got 50% of the votes, candidate C got 50 votes.

"Okay, so Cecelia wants to know how much she spent on milk.  

* A gallon of milk costs $5.
* A half-gallon costs $3 less than a gallon, so it costs $5 - $2 = $3.
* She wants 10 gallons of milk, so that's 10 * $5 = $50.
* She also wants 16 half-gallons, which is 16 * $3 = $48.
* To find the total, we add the cost of the gallons and the half-gallons: $50 + $48 = $98.

So the answer is $98.

"The tomato vendor used to pay $0.50 for each tomato. Now he gets them for $0.40 each.  To find out how much he saves each week, we need to figure out how much he spends on tomatoes each day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. 

He buys 500 tomatoes a day, so he spends $250 on tomatoes each day.  

There are 7 days in a week, so he spends $250 * 7 = $1750 on tomatoes in a week.

To find out how much he saves, we need to subtract the new price from the old price.  He saves $250 * 0.40 = $100 each day.  

So, he saves $1750 - $100 = $1650 each week.

"Okay, so the council had a vote on a new rule.  They voted on it, and the rule passed.  

*  The rule passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. 
*  There are 33 people on the council.

Let's think about this:

*  If there were 'x' people who voted against the rule, then twice as many people voted in favor. That means there were 2x people who voted for the rule.
*  The total number of votes is the number of people who voted against plus the number who voted for the rule. 
*  So, we know that x + 2x = 33. 
*  Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 33.
*  To find out how many people voted for the rule, we divide 33 by 3. 
*  That means 33 / 3 = 11. 
*  So, 2 times 11 is 22.

"Okay, so Krissa needs shirts for her preschoolers.  Here's how we can figure out how many shirts she needs:

* **Extra-small:** 11 kids need that size.
* **Small:** Twice as many as extra-small means 11 * 2 = 22 kids need small shirts.
* **Medium:** Four less than the small size is 22 - 4 = 18 kids need medium shirts.
* **Large:** Half as many as medium is 18 / 2 = 9 kids need large shirts.
* **Extra-large:** Six more than large is 9 + 6 = 15 kids need extra-large shirts.

Now, let's add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 65 shirts.

"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday for soccer.  That's a total of 12 hours. She also reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the time left.  

To figure out how much time she spends on soccer, we need to figure out how much time is left for soccer.  She has 12 hours total and 3 hours for reading, so that leaves 9 hours.  Then, she plays video games for 3 hours. 

So, she spends 12 hours total, and 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday.  That's 12 hours.  She spends 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday.  That's 12 hours.  She spends 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday.  That's 12 hours.  

To figure out what percentage of her weekend she spends on soccer, we need to divide the time she spends on soccer by the total time she has and multiply by 100.

"Here's how to figure out how long Jack is gone:

* **Driving to the museum:** He drives for 2 hours to get there.
* **Driving back home:** He also drives for 2 hours to get back.
* **At the museum:** He spends 6 hours at the museum.

To find the total time, we add up all the times: 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

"Okay, so Mike has 600 movies.  He wants to get rid of his old ones and get digital copies.  

* He has a third of his movies in series, which are cheaper to buy.  
* The rest of his movies are regular movies.
* The regular movies cost $10 each.

Let's figure out how much it costs to get all the movies.

**First, let's figure out how many movies are in series:**

* Mike has 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies in series.

**Now, let's figure out how many movies are left:**

* Mike has 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies left.

**Now, let's figure out how much it costs to buy the older movies:**

* 400 movies * $5/movie = $2000

**Finally, let's figure out how much it costs to buy the regular movies:**

* 400 movies * $10/movie = $4000

**So, the total cost is $2000 + $4000 = $6000**

"Okay, so Winston picked peaches, plums, and apricots.  

* Peaches cost $2.00 per pound, so he spent $12.00 on peaches because he picked 6 pounds.
* Plums cost $1.00 per pound, so he spent $8.00 on plums because he picked 8 pounds.
* Apricots cost $3.00 per pound, so he spent $18.00 on apricots because he picked 6 pounds.

To find the total, we add up the cost of each fruit: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"Okay, so the Llesis family drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour.  That's a long drive!  Then they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour.  To find out how far the vacation spot was, we need to add up the distance they drove and hiked.  

* **Driving:** 6 hours * 50 miles/hour = 300 miles
* **Hiking:** 1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour = 30 miles

So, the total distance to the vacation spot is 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles. 

**Answer:** 330

"Okay, so Ava and Emma are playing a game, and they want to see who's the best!  They each get points for different things:

* **Enemies:** They get 10 points for each enemy they jump on.
* **Berries:** They get 5 points for each berry they collect.
* **Time:** They get 30 points for every second they have left on the timer when they finish the level.

Ava did a little better than Emma, but she also took a little longer.

"Okay, so they ordered four pizzas and it cost $64.  Two of the pizzas cost $30, so we need to figure out how much the other two cost.  

Here's how:

*  The total cost of the pizzas is $64.
*  We know two pizzas cost $30.
*  So, the other two pizzas cost $64 - $30 = $34.
*  Since there are two of them, each pizza costs $34 / 2 = $17.


**Answer:** $17

"So, they ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, that's 3 * 5 = 15 times. Then, on two other days they ride twice as much, so they ride 2 * 3 = 6 times.  That's a total of 15 + 6 = 21 times for the week. 

**Answer:** 21

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* Bob started with 7 fish.
* He got 17 more fish from the store.
* After adding the new fish, he had 24 in total.
* He now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. 

Let's think about that:

* If he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, that means the number of white fish is half the number of orange fish. 
* We know he has 20 orange fish. 
* So, he must have bought 10 white fish. 


**Answer:** Bob bought 10 white fish.

"Okay, so Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon.  That means he uses 0.5 gallons of gas each day to drive to work.  He drives to work 5 days a week, so he uses 2.5 gallons of gas each week.  If gas costs $3 a gallon, that means he spends $7.50 on gas each week. 

**Answer:** $7.50 
"
"Okay, so Carrie got 10 twenties and 140 quarters.  She spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.  To figure out how much she spent, we need to figure out how much the quarters and the twenties are worth. 

* **Quarters:** 140 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $35.00
* **Twenties:** 10 twenties * $20/twenty = $200.00
* **Twenties spent:** 200.00 * (3/5) = $120.00
* **Total spent:** $35.00 + $120.00 = $155.00

So, Carrie spent $155.00 for lunch.

"Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Tomatoes:** He has 5 tomato plants, and each plant gives him 22 tomatoes, so he'll get 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes.
* **Eggplants:** He has 8 eggplant plants, and each plant gives him 4 eggplants, so he'll get 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants.
* **Total:**  He'll have 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits.

"So, Samwell sells TVs in different types: smart, analog, and OLED.  

* Smart TVs make up one-fourth of his sales.
* Analog TVs make up one-eighth of his sales.
* The rest are OLED TVs.

If he sold 40 TVs in total, how many were OLED TVs? 

a) 10
b) 15
c) 25
d) 30

"Okay, so we know there are 10 groups of 9 people each.  That means there are 90 people in total.  

If 3/5 of the people bring back seashells, we need to figure out how many seashells they bring. 

Let's think about it like this:

* 3 out of 5 is the same as 3/5.
* We have 90 people, and 3/5 of them bring seashells.
* To find out how many seashells they bring, we multiply the number of people by the number of seashells each person brings. 

So, 90 people * (3/5) = 54 seashells.

* **Marshmallows left:** They started with 35 and used 18, so they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.
* **S'mores each kid can have:**  They have 17 marshmallows and can share them between 2 kids, so each kid can have 17 / 2 = 8.5 s'mores. 

Since you can't have half a s'more, they can each have 8 s'mores.

"Okay, so they're playing for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

* Jack plays for 240 minutes.
* Friend 1 plays for 120 minutes.
* Friend 2 plays for 60 minutes.
* Friend 3 plays for 360 minutes.

So, they play a total of 240 + 120 + 60 + 360 = 780 minutes.

To figure out how much they spend, we need to know how many games they play.  Jack plays 240 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 12 games.

So, they spend $3.00. 



 
"
"Okay, let's break this down!

* **We know Tanya makes a 10-ounce mixture.**  That's our starting point.
* **She uses the same amount of zest as fragrance.**  This means the zest and fragrance are the same.
* **She uses twice as much salt as zest.**  So, the salt is twice the amount of zest.
* **She uses twice as much oil as salt.**  This means the oil is twice the amount of salt.
* **She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.**  This means the salt and sugar are the same.

**Let's use some simple math to figure out the amount of oil:**

* **We know the amount of salt is the same as the amount of sugar.**  Let's call this amount 's'.
* **We know the amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.**  So, the oil is 2 * s.
* **We know the amount of zest is the same as the amount of fragrance.**  Let's call this amount 'z'.
* **We know the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.**  So, the salt is 2 * z.

**Now, let's put it all together:**

* **The total amount of salt, zest, and sugar is 10 ounces.**
* **The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.** 

**To find the amount of oil, we need to figure out the amount of salt.**

"Paul needs 63 cupcakes for his birthday party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.  To find out how many more cupcakes he needs, we need to subtract the cupcakes he has from the total he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.  So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes. 


 
"
"Okay, so Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20.  That means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars. 

If Joe sells 20% of his cars, that's 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.  Then he gives away twice that amount to his mom, which is 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

So, Joe has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.

"Okay, so Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 less than that, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, so she scored 18 - 6 = 12 points.

To find Sasha's total points, we add her scores from both games: 14 + 12 = 26 points. 

So the answer is 26.

"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food.  She has 88 tins of cat food and 36 tins of dog food.  To find out how many more cat food tins she bought than dog food tins, we need to subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins.  That's 88 - 36 = 52.  So the answer is 52.

"Okay, so we know Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have a total of 341 cards.  Let's figure out how many Becca has.

* **Think about the clues:** We know Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has. 

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let's say PJ has 'x' cards.
    * Smendrick has 3 times that amount, so he has 3x cards.
    * Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Put it all together:**  The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x + 12 = 341
    * 7x = 329
    * x = 47 (This is how many cards PJ has)

* **Find Becca's cards:**
    * Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards. 
"
"Okay, let's break down how many eggs Cindy has:

* **Blue eggs:** She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she had 5 green eggs. So, she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* **Pink eggs:** She had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
* **Yellow eggs:** She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
* **Total eggs:**  Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs altogether.

So the answer is 27.

"Okay, so Milly has to return this book.  It costs $32, weighs 4 pounds, and she has to drive 20 miles to the place where she can return it.  The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  They'll only give her 75% of the price she paid for the book.  

To figure out how much she'll lose, we need to figure out the total cost of shipping and the total cost of the book. 

* **Shipping cost:** 
    * The book weighs 4 pounds.
    * It costs $0.35 per pound to ship.
    * So, the shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
* **Mileage cost:**
    * She has to drive 20 miles.
    * It costs $0.08 per mile to drive.
    * So, the mileage cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60
* **Total cost:**
    * The total cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00
* **Refund amount:**
    * The book cost $32.
    * She'll get 75% of that back.
    * So, the refund is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00
* **Final cost:**
    * The total cost is $3.00
    * She'll get $24.00 back.
    * So, she'll lose $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00


**Answer:** Milly will lose $21.00

"Mulan starts with $40. Her dad gives her $100. She buys two pairs of jeans for $30 each, and a bag for $20.  

To find out how much money she has left, we need to figure out how much everything costs. 

* Jeans cost $30 each, so two pairs cost $30 * 2 = $60.
* The bag costs $20.
* In total, Mulan spends $60 + $20 = $80.
* She started with $40 and now has $80. 
* To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from her starting amount: $140 - $80 = $60.

Mulan has $60 left.

"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars a month.  He makes 8,000 in the first week.  The second week he makes half as much, so he makes 4,000.  Then in the third week he makes three times as much as the first week, so he makes 24,000.  That's a total of 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  To find out how much he makes in the fourth week, we take his total for the first three weeks and subtract that from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.  So, he makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Okay, so Brittany makes 18 TikTok videos each week.  She also spends 2 hours writing songs and 15 minutes getting ready for each video.  

To figure out how much time she spends on TikTok in a month, we need to add up all the time she spends on each part of it. 

* **TikTok videos:** 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
* **Song writing:** 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
* **Makeup:** 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes
* **Total time:** 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

Now, we need to figure out how many minutes she spends on TikTok in a month.  There are 4 weeks in a month, so we multiply the weekly time by 4.

* **Monthly time:** 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes

"Okay, so Angela needs to get some stuff hung up.  She has a bunch of mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures.  Here's how we figure out how much it'll cost:

* **Mirrors:** She has 6 mirrors, and they cost $15 each to hang.  So that's 6 * $15 = $90.
* **Chandeliers:** She has 2 chandeliers, and they cost $15 each to hang. That's 2 * $15 = $30.
* **Pictures:** She has 20 pictures, and they cost $15 each to hang. That's 20 * $15 = $300.
* **Total:**  The total cost is $90 + $30 + $300 = $420.

**So the answer is $420.**

"Here's how to figure out how much money Roy has:

* **Anthony's savings:** Anthony saved $10 more than Eva, who saved $20. So Anthony saved $20 + $10 = $30.
* **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony.  To find out how much more, we need to multiply Anthony's savings by 40%.  That's 0.40 * $30 = $12.
* **Roy's total savings:**  Roy saved $30 + $12 = $42.

**Answer:** Roy has $42.

"Okay, so we know Pompei can lift 1 inch.  Then Saskay can lift 12 times that, which is 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift 4 times that, which is 48 inches.  And Naruto can lift 10 times that, which is 480 inches.  To figure out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to convert that to feet.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet. 

**Answer:** 40 feet

"Okay, so Patrick has three glue sticks.  We need to find out how much glue is left on the sticks that aren't used. 

* **Stick 1:**  Has 1/6 of the glue left.
* **Stick 2:** Has 2/3 of the glue left.
* **Stick 3:** Has 1/2 of the glue left.

To find the total glue used, we add up how much is left on each stick: 1/6 + 2/3 + 1/2.  To make this easier, let's find a common denominator: 

* 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6.  

Now we know that 8/6 of the glue is used.  To find out how much glue is left, we subtract the amount used from the total glue: 12 mm - (8/6) mm.

* 12 mm - (8/6) mm = (12 * 3) mm - (8 * 1) mm = 36 mm - 8 mm = 28 mm.

**Answer:** 28 millimeters

"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes.  That means he has twice as many dishes as socks.  To figure out how many socks he has, we need to figure out how many socks he has.  Since he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can figure out how many socks he has by dividing the number of dishes by 2.  So, Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Together, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks.

Jack has 60 dishes, and Peter has 60 socks, so they have a total of 60 + 60 = 120 dishes.

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 120 = 210.

"Vicki can have 12 groups perform! 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Time for each group:**  They get 2 minutes to set up, 6 minutes to play, and 2 minutes to leave. That's a total of 10 minutes.
* **Total time for the concert:**  Vicki has 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
* **How many groups can fit in the concert:** 120 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 12 groups.

"Brenda invested $300 and it grows with simple interest.  That means she gets the same amount of interest each year.  

*  The interest rate is 3/4 of her original money, so she gets 0.75 times her $300 each year.
*  Over 3 years, she'll get 0.75 * $300 * 3 = $675 in total interest.
*  So, after 3 years, Brenda will have $300 + $675 = $975.

"Okay, so we have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half of the white shirts have collars, so that's 20.  We also know 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.  To find out how many floral shirts don't have buttons, we subtract the number with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.  Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars.  That's 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break this down!

*  We know you're 3 years younger than your brother.  Let's say your brother is 'x' years old. That means you are 'x - 3' years old.
*  You're also 2 years older than your sister. Your sister is 'x - 2' years old.
*  Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.  That means your mom is 3x - 1 years old.

Now, let's add up all your ages: (x - 3) + (x) + (x - 2) + (3x - 1) = 87

Simplify the equation: 5x - 6 = 87

Solve for x: 5x = 93
 
Find your age: x = 18.6

"Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.  Here's why:

* He has 27 students.
* Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
* Glue sticks come in packs of 8. 

To figure out how many packs he needs, we do:

* 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks
* 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

Since you can't buy parts of a pack, he needs to buy 7 packs.

If we think about it like this, Wendy gets 2.5 more badges every month than Amber. Over a year, that means she gets 2.5 * 12 = 30 more badges than Amber.

"Okay, so Madeline and her roommate share groceries. They spend $400 a month, and Madeline pays 60% of that.  To figure out how much Keenan pays, we need to figure out what percentage he pays. 

Keenan pays the rest, so we can find that by subtracting Madeline's share from the total.  

* Madeline pays 60% of $400, which is $240.
* That means Keenan pays the other 40%, or $400 - $240 = $160.

Now, we need to figure out how much Keenan pays per week.  There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide his weekly cost by 4.

Keenan pays $160 / 4 weeks = $40 per week.

"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair.  To figure out how much she spent on a manicure, we know she spent 1/4 of that amount. So, she spent $400 / 4 = $100 on a manicure.  Then, for her pedicure, she spent 3/4 of what she spent on the manicure, which is $100 * (3/4) = $75.  Finally, to find the total amount she spent, we add up all the costs: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.

"Sarah sells her rope for $2 per meter.  She wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.50 per meter.  To figure out how much money she'll have left, we need to know how many meters of the new rope she buys. 

Let's say she buys 'x' meters of the new rope.  

* **Total money Sarah makes:** 20 meters * $2/meter = $40
* **Total money Sarah spends:** $1.50/meter * x meters

"Let's think about this problem step-by-step:

* Melanie is 8 years old now.
* In 10 years, she'll be 18.
* We want to find out how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age.

Think about it like this: if we want to know how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age, we need to figure out how many years it will take for her age to be 3 * 8. 

So, we need to find out how many years it will take for her age to be 24. 

Let's think about it like this: 8 + x = 24. 

Solving for x, we get x = 24 - 8 = 16. 

**Answer:** It will take 16 years for her age to be three times her present age.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Kelly has bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples.  We need to figure out how much money she has left.

* Bacon: 5 packs cost $10.
* Chicken: Each pack costs twice as much as bacon, so they cost $10 * 2 = $20. She has 6 packs, so that's $20 * 6 = $120.
* Strawberries: 3 packs cost $4 each, so that's $4 * 3 = $12.
* Apples: Each pack costs half the price of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2. She has 7 packs, so that's $2 * 7 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the things: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Kelly has $65 left in her budget. 

So, she has $65 - $156 = -$91.

"Let's break this down!

* **We know:** Peter, Paul, and Jean are all together 100 years old.
* **We know:** Paul is 10 years older than John.
* **We know:** Peter's age is the same as Paul and John's combined age.

Let's use some simple math to figure this out!

**Let's use letters to represent their ages:**

* Peter's age is ""P""
* Paul's age is ""P + 10"" (because he's 10 years older than John)
* John's age is ""J""

**Now we can write down what we know:**

* P + P + J = 100 (The total age is 100)
* P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages)

**Let's solve for the ages:**

* We can use the second equation to help us find J:  P = P + 10 + J
* We can substitute the first equation into this equation: 2P + J = 100
* We can solve for J: J = 100 - 2P

**Now we can use this to find P:**

* We know that P = P + 10 + J
* We can substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
* Simplify and solve for P: 3P = 110
* Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Answer:** Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.

"Okay, so James gets 10 CDs, and they cost $15 each.  He gets a discount of 40%, which means he pays less.  He keeps 5 of the CDs and sells the rest.  He sells the CDs for $40 each.  How much money did he lose? 

**Answer:**  He lost $50.

"Jen has a bunch of root crops to sell!  She has 6 yams that cost $1.50 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each.  

To figure out how much she'll earn, we need to add up how much she gets for each type of crop:

* Yams: 6 yams * $1.50/yam = $9.00
* Sweet Potatoes: 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.00
* Carrots: 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.00

So, in total, she'll earn $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00 

**Answer:** $34.00 
"
"Okay, so James wants to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim 2 miles per hour.  He swims for 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles.  

To figure out how long it takes him to swim, we need to know how long it takes him to swim 12 miles.  He swims at 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

After swimming, he takes a break for 3 hours.  

He then has to swim the rest of the way, which is 8 miles.  He swims at half the speed, so he takes 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, he takes 6 hours to swim the first part, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to swim the rest.  That's a total of 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours. 


**Answer:** 17 hours

"Let's break this down:

* Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
* The bakery has 40 less than seven times that amount. 

To find out how many loaves the bakery has, we need to figure out what 7 times Sam's amount is, then subtract 40.

* 7 times Sam's loaves: 7 * 70 = 490
* 40 less than 490: 490 - 40 = 450

The bakery has **450** loaves of bread.

"Okay, so he sells 6 New York Times and 10 Wall Street Journals.  

* New York Times: 6 copies * $0.10 per copy = $0.60
* Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * $0.08 per copy = $0.80

So, he makes $0.60 from the New York Times and $0.80 from the Wall Street Journal.  

The total is $0.60 + $0.80 = $1.40

"Let's break this down!

* We know the team scored a total of 45 points.
* Bahati scored the most, and it was 20 more than Azibo.
* Bahati also scored 10 more than Dinar.

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many points each person scored.

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let Dinar's score be ""D""
*  Let Azibo's score be ""A""
*  Let Bahati's score be ""B""

**Now, let's write down what we know:**

* B = A + 20  (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

**We can use these equations to solve for Azibo's score (A):**

* Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:
   * D + 10 = A + 20
   * A = D - 10

* Now we can plug that into the total points equation:
   * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

* Let's simplify and solve for D:
   * 3D + 10 = 45
   * 3D = 35
   * D = 35 / 3 
   * D = 11.67 (approximately)

* Now that we know D, we can find A:
   * A = D - 10
   * A = 11.67 - 10
   * A = 1.67 (approximately)

"So, the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each page is printed on both sides.  That means there are 100 pages per inch.  So, to find out how many pages are in the book, we just multiply the thickness by the number of pages per inch. 

The answer is 150 pages.

"Okay, so the hospital has 1000 beds and 200 of them are already filled.  Then, 50 new patients come in each day.  To find out how many beds are empty, we need to figure out how many beds are filled in two weeks.  

*  In two weeks, 50 patients come in every day, so that's 50 * 14 = 700 patients.
*  We know there are 1000 beds total, and 700 patients are in the hospital, so there are 1000 - 700 = 300 empty beds. 


**Answer:** 300

"Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.  Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.  Aliya is 3 years old.  To find out how old Shawna's father is, we need to figure out how old Shawna is.  Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.  Then, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so he is 5 * 9 = 45 years old. 

**Answer:** 45

"Okay, so Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. Kelly thinks that's wrong, and she thinks Courtney overcounted by 20%.  To figure out how many people were actually there, we need to figure out how many people Courtney overcounted. 

20% of 48 is like taking 20 out of 48.  That's 0.20 times 48, which is 9.6.  

So, if Courtney overcounted by 9.6 people, then there were 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 people at the concert.

"Okay, so we know Jason carried 2 balls.  That means Jeffrey carried 1 ball, and Jordan carried 4 balls.  To find out how many balls the coach brought, we just need to add up the number of balls they carried.  That's 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 balls.  So the answer is 7.

"The pirates dug a total of 31 holes before they filled in two.  Then they dug 29 more holes.  To find out how many holes they dug on the fourth day, we need to add the number of holes they dug before finding the treasure to the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.

"Okay, so Amora and Lainey each get 70 chips.  That's a total of 70 + 70 = 140 chips.  The other two people get the rest, and they get 125 chips.  So, there are 140 + 125 = 265 chips in total.

"Okay, so Jen needs $400 for supplies.  The tickets cost 50% more than that.  To figure out how much the tickets cost, we need to figure out what 50% of $400 is.  

* 50% of $400 is (50/100) * $400 = $200. 
* The tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600. 


 
**Answer:** $600

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are catching Pokemon.  They have a total of 339 Pokemon.  

* **Let's use some simple math to figure out how many each person caught:**

   *  We know Alex caught 5 more than Stan. Let's call the number of Pokemon Stan caught ""S"". So, Alex caught ""S + 5"" Pokemon.
   *  Stan caught 13 less than 4 times the number Adelwolfe caught. Let's call the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught ""W"".  So, Stan caught ""4W - 13"" Pokemon.

* **Now let's put it all together:**

   *  Alex + Stan + Adelwolfe = 339 Pokemon
   *  We know Alex caught S + 5, Stan caught S - 13, and Adelwolfe caught W Pokemon.  So, we can write that equation as: (S + 5) + S + W = 339

* **Let's solve for Stan's catch (S):**

   *  We know W = 41 (because we know Adelwolfe caught 41 Pokemon).  Let's plug that into our equation: (S + 5) + S + 41 = 339
   *  Combine like terms: 2S + 46 = 339
   *  Subtract 46 from both sides: 2S = 339 - 46
   *  Simplify: 2S = 293
   *  Divide both sides by 2: S = 146.5 

* **Stan caught 146.5 Pokemon.  Wait, that doesn't make sense!**  We need to round to the nearest whole number.  So, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

"Okay, so the show has 20 minutes per episode.  But there are half as many episodes as minutes, so we need to figure out how many episodes there are.  

If there are 20 minutes per episode, and we divide that by 20 minutes, we get 1 episode. 

So, if he watches every episode, he'll watch 20 minutes. 


**Answer:** 20

"Okay, so the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.  That's 300 miles. Then she flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 36 miles.  Finally, she flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, which is 110 miles.  To find the total distance, we add all those up: 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles. 

**Answer:** 446 miles

* **Length and Width:** The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.
* **Total Length:**  To find the total length of the fence, we add the length and width: 15 feet + 10 feet = 25 feet.
* **Slats:**  He needs 2 slats for every foot of fence, so we multiply the total length by 2: 25 feet * 2 slats/foot = 50 slats.

"Okay, so India has 4 more states than half the number of states in the USA.  To figure out the total number of states, we need to do a little math. 

* Half the number of states in the USA is 50 / 2 = 25.
* India has 4 more than half, so it has 25 + 4 = 29 states.
*  The USA has 50 states and India has 29, so together they have 50 + 29 = 79 states.

**Answer: 79**

"Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Find the total cost:** The dictionary, dinosaur book, and cookbook cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.
* **See how much more money he needs:**  He only has $14 saved, so he needs $39 - $14 = $25 more.
* **Calculate how many hours he needs to work:** He earns $5 per hour, so he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours.

"Okay, so we know Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard.  To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to figure out how many cherries Jerry has.  

We know they have 60 cherries total, and Robert has 30, so Richard and Robert have 50 cherries together.  

To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the cherries Richard and Robert have from the total number of cherries: 60 - 50 = 10.

Finally, we find the difference between Robert's cherries and Jerry's cherries: 50 - 10 = 40. 


**Answer:** 40

"Okay, so Sunny sold gingerbread and apple pie for a fundraiser.  

* On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. 
* On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Let's figure out how much he made!

**Saturday's Earnings:**

* He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer than that on Sunday, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.
* He made $6 per gingerbread box and 10 gingerbread boxes, so he made 10 * $6 = $60.
* He also made $15 per apple pie box and sold 6 apple pie boxes, so he made 6 * $15 = $90.
* His total earnings on Saturday were $60 + $90 = $150.

**Sunday's Earnings:**

* On Sunday, he sold 5 more gingerbread boxes than Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes.
* He sold 15 apple pie boxes and made $15 per box, so he made 15 * $15 = $225.

"Pamela needs 4 bottles of sunscreen.  Here's how we figure that out:

* **Sunscreen per day:** She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside, and she's outside for 4 hours a day. So she uses 1 ounce/hour * 4 hours/day = 4 ounces of sunscreen each day.
* **Sunscreen for the whole trip:** She'll be outside for 8 days, so she'll need 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.
* **Bottles needed:** Each bottle has 8 ounces, so she'll need 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles.

"The blue car costs $100.  The red car is 40% cheaper, so it costs $100 - (0.40 * $100) = $60 less.  The red car costs $100 - $60 = $40.  So, both cars cost $100 + $40 = $140.

"Here's how to solve this:

* Emil is 19 now, and when he's 24, he'll be half his dad's age and twice his brother's age. 
*  Let's think about the dad's age: when Emil is 24, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
*  Let's think about the brother's age: when Emil is 24, his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
*  Now we know the dad's age and the brother's age, we can find the sum of their ages. 
*  The sum of the dad's and brother's ages is 48 + 12 = 60.

**Answer:** 60

"Adrianne got 20 beads from her mom. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so she got 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mom, so she got 20 * 2 = 40 beads.  In total, Adrianne has 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

"Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday.  On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds.  On Saturday, he caught half of that amount, which is 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds.  In total, he caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds.  He can make 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.

"Okay, so we know 20% of the class is football players, which is 6 students.  Then, there are 24 students left.  

Out of those 24, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band, which is 6 students. 

So, 6 students (football) + 6 students (cheerleaders/band) = 12 students are leaving early.

"If Sophie wears size 5 boots, Charlie's boots are 5 times bigger, so they're size 5 * 5 = 25.  To find the average, we add up their sizes and divide by 2.  So, 25 + 5 = 30, and 30 / 2 = 15.

"Okay, so Pat has a flower bed that's 111 feet long.  She wants to put flowers in it, and each flower needs 1.5 feet of space between them.  She already has 17 flowers, so she needs to figure out how many more she needs to buy.

First, we need to figure out how wide the flower bed is in inches.  111 feet is 111 * 12 inches = 1332 inches.

Now, she can fit 1332 inches / 1.5 feet/plant = 888 plants in her flower bed.  

She needs to buy 888 - 17 = 871 more plants.

Finally, each plant costs $6, so she'll spend 871 * $6 = $5226 at the store. 


**Answer:** $5226

"Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many, so he eats 18 / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by the number of days in a week: 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels. So the answer is 63.

"Jessica has $2,000 a month. She saves 25% of that for shoes.  Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.  So, how many shoes can she buy?

**a) 2**
**b) 4**
**c) 24**
 
Let's figure it out! 

First, we need to see how much money she saves for shoes each month: $2,000 * 0.25 = $500. 

Then, we can see how many shoes she can buy with that money: $500 / $1,000 = 0.5 pairs. 

Since she can't buy half a pair of shoes, we need to figure out how many pairs she can buy in a year. 

She can buy 24 pairs of shoes in a year.

"Okay, so Emily can peel shrimp really fast!  She peels 6 shrimp every minute.  To cook them, it takes her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp.  So, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 minutes.  Then, she needs 15 minutes to peel all the shrimp.  So, it will take her 15 + 3 = 18 minutes to peel and cook all the shrimp. 

**Answer:** 18 minutes

"Okay, so the comet orbits the sun every 75 years.  Bill's dad saw it when he was 30.  Bill saw it again when he was three times his dad's age.  To figure out how old Bill was when he saw it the first time, we need to figure out how old Bill was when he saw it the second time.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Bill saw the comet again when he was 90 years old.
* That means he saw it 75 years before he was 90. 
* So, Bill was 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

"Okay, so the first plane flies to Greece three-quarters of the time.  That means it flies to Greece for 3/4 of its trips.  The rest of the trips are split between France and Germany.  

The other plane flies to Poland, and it makes half the number of trips the first plane does.  

Let's figure out how many trips the first plane makes.

"Okay, so Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote for twice as long, and Igneous for the same amount as both of them.  

Let's figure out how long they howl together:

* Chikote's howl is 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds long.
* Together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* Igneous howls for the same amount as Tobias and Chikote, so he also howls for 60 seconds.
* In total, they howl for 60 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* That's 120 seconds, which is 2 minutes. 

**Answer:** 2 minutes

**Answer:** $12

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* We know the average age of the group is 5 years.
* We also know that Helene is twice the average age, so she's 10 years old.
* The total age of Akbar and Alessandro is 7 years.
* To find Wilfred's age, we subtract Helene's age and the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age of all the children. 
* This gives us 20 - 10 - 7 = 3 years.

"Walter's lawyer is going to give $3800. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* Walter gets $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from his online fund. That's a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.
* His lawyer is going to give three times the amount Walter and his friends get, so he's going to give 3 * $2000 = $6000.
* Walter and his friend give a total of $2000. 
* To find out how much his lawyer gives, we subtract the amount Walter and his friend give from the total amount his lawyer will give: $6000 - $2000 = $3800.

"The bride gave half of the cookies to the church, so they got 750 cookies.  Since each person in the church got 15 cookies, there were 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people in the church.

"Okay, so we have a family of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids.  They want to cut a watermelon so that each adult gets a slice that's twice as big as each kid's slice.  

To figure out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to figure out how big each adult's slice is compared to the kids' slices. 

Let's say each kid gets a slice that's 'x' big.  The adults get twice that size, so each adult gets 2x.

Now, there are 2 adults and 4 kids, so there are a total of 6 slices.  

To figure out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to figure out what fraction of the slices the adults get.  

So, each adult gets 2x slices out of 6 total slices.  That means each adult gets (2x/6) = (x/3) of the watermelon. 

To figure out the percentage, we multiply that fraction by 100%.  So, each adult gets (x/3) * 100%

"Okay, so Jordan wants to make a cake for her mom's birthday.  She needs to figure out when to start so it's ready by 5:00 pm. 

Here's how long it takes to make the cake:

* Making the batter: 20 minutes
* Baking: 30 minutes
* Cooling: 2 hours is 120 minutes
* Frosting: 10 minutes

Let's add all that up: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes

To figure out when to start, we need to subtract the total time from 5:00 pm.  

So, 5:00 pm - 180 minutes = 1:00 pm 

That means Jordan needs to start making the cake at 1:00 pm.

"To figure out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold in total. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. That's a total of 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

Since they sold 64 chocolate bars, we can figure out how many are in each box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes: 64 chocolate bars / 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box. 


**Answer:** 8 
"
"Okay, so the dance studio charges $25 to rent the place and $1.50 per student per session.  They have 10 students and go to the studio 3 days a week.  To figure out how much they make each month, we need to figure out how much they charge for each session and how many sessions they have in a month. 

So, each session costs $25 plus $1.50 per student, which is $1.50 * 10 students = $15.  So, each session costs $25 + $15 = $40.

They go to the studio 3 days a week, so in a month they go 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions.

So, they make $40 per session * 12 sessions = $480. 


**Answer:** $480 
"
"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Peter:** Peter has 64 chocolate bars in total, and he has 4 boxes.  That means each box has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.
* **Martha:** Martha has 56 chocolate bars in total, and she has 7 boxes. That means each box has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.
* **The Difference:** Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. 


**Answer:** 8 
"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Start with the total porcupines:** There are 50 porcupines in the park.
* **Find the number of females:**  Since 3/5 of the porcupines are female, there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 female porcupines.
* **Babies born:** Each female gives birth to 4 babies a month, so in a year, they'd have 4 * 12 = 48 babies.
* **Total porcupines after a year:**  We start with 50 and add the babies, so there will be 50 + 48 = 98 porcupines. 


**Answer:** 98 
"
"Okay, so the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  To figure out how much water they need, we multiply the length, width, and depth. That gives us 25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet. 

Now, we know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. So, we multiply the cubic feet by 7.48 to get the total gallons needed. That's 1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10,392 gallons.

Finally, the pool company charges $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the total gallons by the price per gallon to find the total cost. That's 10,392 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $1039.20. 


**Answer:** $1039.20 
"
"Okay, so they have 9 red sticks.  They also have 5 more blue sticks than red, so they have 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  And the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so they have 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  Finally, they have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks in total. 

**Answer:** 34

"Okay, so Matteo drove for 4 hours at 55 miles per hour. That's 55 miles * 4 = 220 miles. 

Shandy drove for 10 hours at 45 miles per hour. That's 45 miles * 10 = 450 miles.

To find out how much farther Shandy drove, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles.

So the answer is 230 miles. 


"
"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Students over 16:** Half of the students are over 16, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
* **Male students over 16:** One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students.
* **Female students under 16:** The rest of the students are under 16, so there are 3000 - 1500 = 1500 students.
* **Female students under 16:** Half of the students under 16 are female, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 female students.

"Bethany can run 10 laps, Trey runs 14, Shaelyn runs 7, and Quinn runs 5.  To find out how many more laps Bethany runs than Quinn, we need to subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps.  So, Bethany runs 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn.

"Okay, so they fill the tank over two days.  Let's break it down:

* **Day 1:** Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.  Ms. B fills 3/4 of that, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.  That's a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons pumped on day 1.
* **Day 2:** Wanda fills 2/3 of what she did on day 1, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B fills 1/3 of what she did on day 1, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.  That's a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons pumped on day 2.
* **Total:**  They pumped a total of 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons in two days.
* **Remaining:**  To find out how much is left, we subtract the total pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.


**Answer:** 6000 gallons

"Okay, so Maria's power bank was at 100% when she started.  

First, it lost 45% of its charge in the first 5 hours.  That means it had 55% left.

Then, for the next 3 hours, it lost 21% of its charge.  So, it had 34% left.

"Okay, so James reads 18 pages.  He reads 3 pages every 10 minutes.  To find out how long he reads, we need to figure out how many 10-minute chunks are in 18 pages.  

* 18 pages / 3 pages per 10 minutes = 6 times 10 minutes = 60 minutes. 

So the answer is 60 minutes.

"Okay, so the hotel was full with 100 guests.  Some people checked out early, and some checked in later.  

* **People who checked out early:** 24
* **People who checked in later:** 30 (twice as many as the late checkouts)
* **More people checked in after dinner:** 7
* **Total people who checked in:** 15 + 30 + 7 = 52
* **Total people who checked out:** 100 - 24 - 15 = 61
* **Total people at the hotel now:** 61 + 52 = 113

"Okay, so there are 60 questions in the quiz.  40% of them are easy, so that's 24 questions. The rest are average and difficult, and there are 36 of those.

"Let's break this down!

* Teresa sells stuffed animals, and she sells them in different sizes.
* She sells them for three times the price of the small ones.
* She sold twice as many small ones as large ones.
* She made $120 from all the sales.
* Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

We need to figure out how many small stuffed animals she sold. 

Let's use some math:

* **Let's say 'x' is the number of large stuffed animals she sold.**
* **Since she sold twice as many small ones as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of a large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small one, so each large one costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**So, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"Okay, so the man eats 5 sandwiches, his wife eats 4, and their son eats 2.  To find the total, we just add them up: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches.  Now, we need to know how many sandwiches they eat in a week.  That's 11 sandwiches a day times 7 days a week, so it's 11 * 7 = 77 sandwiches. 

**Answer:** 77 
"
"Suzanne made $80 from cookies and $240 from cupcakes.  She also got $20 from her sisters.  To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of the gifts from her total earnings.  So, $320 - $20 = $300.  She has $300 left. 


**Answer:** $300

"
"Okay, so we have 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.  They each mine 18 pounds of ore a day.  That's a lot of ore!  To find out how much they mine in a month, we just need to multiply the amount they mine each day by the number of days in a month.  

So, 18 pounds/day * 30 days = 540 pounds. 


**Answer:** 540

"The store sells sandwiches in different sizes.  The first size has 2 sandwiches for $3, the second has 4 sandwiches for $6, and the third has 8 sandwiches.  Since the prices are the same for each sandwich, the price of the 8-sandwich package is $12.00. 

**Answer:** $12.00

"Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  Then, 40% of her red balloons popped, so she had 15 red balloons left.  She also let go of half of her yellow balloons, leaving her with 6 yellow balloons.  Finally, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 6 of them to her collection.  In total, Sally had 27 balloons.

"So, there's a 50% chance the teacher won't collect the homework.  If she does, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.  If not, there's a 20% chance Marcus can say his dog ate his homework.  

To figure out the chance Marcus has to turn in his homework, we need to think about all the different ways it could happen.  

* **Marcus doesn't turn in homework:** 50% chance the teacher won't collect it. 
* **Marcus turns in homework:** 40% chance the teacher gives everyone an extension. 
* **Marcus turns in homework and gets an extension:** 20% chance he can say his dog ate his homework. 

So, the chance Marcus has to turn in his homework is 80%

"Okay, so the school has 6000 seats for the graduation.  They're letting 950 people graduate and 300 people who work there come too.  That means there are 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats left.  If they want to give each graduate 1 ticket, they can give each graduate 4750 / 1000 = 4.75 tickets.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Large beans:** Grandpa eats 75 large jelly beans.
* **Medium beans:** He eats twice as many medium beans as large beans, so he eats 75 * 2 = 150 medium beans.
* **Small beans:**  Since 3 small beans are equal to 1 medium bean, Grandpa can eat 150 / 3 = 50 small beans.

"Okay, so Melissa works for 3 days and spends 6 hours each day.  She gets paid $15 a day, but has to pay $3 for parking.  To figure out how much she makes per hour after paying for parking, we need to do a few things. 

First, we need to figure out how much she makes each day. She gets $15 a day and has to pay $3 for parking, so she makes $15 - $3 = $12 each day.

Then, we need to figure out how many hours she works. She works 6 hours each day for 3 days, so she works 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Finally, we can figure out how much she makes per hour after paying for parking. She makes $12 for 18 hours, so she makes $12 / 18 = $0.67 per hour.

"Ted buys 3 books for $16 each, so that's 3 * $16 = $48.  He also buys 3 pencils for $6 each, so that's 3 * $6 = $18.  In total, he spends $48 + $18 = $66.

"Okay, so Richard wants to put soda bottles all along his driveway.  He wants to put one bottle every 3 feet.  He's going to drop a candy in each bottle.  How long will it take him to do this? 

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **How many bottles are there?**  He has a 24 foot driveway, and he puts a bottle every 3 feet. So he'll have 24 / 3 = 8 bottles.
* **How long does it take to do each bottle?**  It takes him 5 seconds to put the candy in each bottle.
* **How long is the whole process?**  He has 8 bottles, and it takes him 5 seconds to put a candy in each bottle, so it will take him 8 * 5 = 40 seconds.

**Answer:** 40 seconds

"Okay, so Amor buys Parmesan cheese for $11 per pound and mozzarella for $6 per pound.  She buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of mozzarella.  That's a total of $22 for the Parmesan and $18 for the mozzarella.  So, she spends $22 + $18 = $40 on cheese.  She started with $50, so she has $50 - $40 = $10 left. 

**Answer:** $10

"Okay, so Jim goes to college for 4 years and gets $50,000 a year in loans.  His job before college paid him $25,000 a year.  His degree makes his job worth three times as much, so he makes $75,000 a year now.  

To figure out how long it takes to make the money he owes, we need to figure out how much he makes in total.  He'll make $75,000 a year for 4 years.  That's $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.  

But he also has $200,000 in loans.  So, he needs to make $300,000 - $200,000 = $100,000 more.

So, it will take him 100,000 / 75,000 = 1.33 years to make that extra money. 


**Answer:** 1.33 years

"Okay, so Jim needs fabric for his big bed.  The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  He wants two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider.  To figure out how much fabric he needs, we need to find the area of the bed and then double it because he needs two pieces. 

The bed is 6 feet * 8 feet, which is 48 square feet.  He needs to buy two pieces of fabric, so he needs 48 * 2 = 96 square feet. 


**Answer:** 96

"Okay, so the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.  On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of that amount, which is 425 / 5 = 85.  So they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount they delivered on Tuesday, which is 102 * 2 = 204.  Then they added 5 more, so they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Finally, to find the total, we add up all the letters they delivered: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Okay, so Johnny's dad bet money on the horse races.  He lost $5 on the first race, then won $11 on the second race, and lost $16.50 on the third race.  To find out his average loss, we need to add up all his losses and then divide by the number of races.  

His total losses are $5 + $11 + $16.50 = $32.50.  

He had 3 races, so his average loss is $32.50 / 3 = $10.83.

"There are 26 countries in South America, and each has 5 cities with 1000 people in each.  So, there are 26 * 5 = 130 cities.  If everyone lives in these cities, there are 130 * 1000 = 130,000 people in South America. 

**Answer:** 130,000

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Xavier grew 3 inches, so he's now 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches tall.
* Cole grew 2 inches, so he's now 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches tall.
* The difference is 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

**Answer:** 1

"Okay, so we have three people sharing $1920.  The second person got $80 more than the first, and the third got twice what the second got.  To figure out how much the first person got, we need to figure out how much each person got.

Let's think about it like this:

* **Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars.**
* **The second person got 'x + $80' dollars.**
* **The third person got '2(x + $80)' dollars.**

Now, we know that the total amount of money divided by the number of people equals the amount each person got.  So, we can write an equation:

(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

Let's solve for 'x':

1.  (4x + $160) / 3 = $1920
2.  4x + $160 = $5760
3.  4x = $5600
4.  x = $1400

So, the first person got $1400! 


**Answer:** $1400

"Okay, so they worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  That's a lot of painting!  

To figure out how many hours they worked, we need to figure out how many days they worked. 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Now, they worked 3/8 of a day each day, so they worked 3/8 * 21 = 63/8 days.

To convert that to hours, we know there are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply 63/8 by 24. That gives us 63/8 * 24 = 189 hours.

Finally, we divide that by the number of painters, which is 4. That gives us 189 / 4 = 47.25 hours per painter.

"Okay, so Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total.  Let's think about how many he got in each set. 

* **Set 1:**  He got 4 more balls than the second set.
* **Set 2:**  He got x balls in the second set.
* **Set 3:** He got half as many balls as the second set.

To figure out how many he got in the first set, we need to figure out how many he got in the second set. 

Let's use the information we know:

* **Total:** 19 balls
* **Set 1:**  x + 4
* **Set 2:** x
* **Set 3:** x/2

Let's put it all together:

x + x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Now we can solve for x:

* Combine like terms: 4x + 4 + x/2 = 19
* Get rid of the fraction: 4x + 4 + 0.5x = 19
* Combine like terms: 4.5x + 4 = 19
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 4.5x = 15
* Divide both sides by 4.5: x = 3.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a ball, we need to think about what we did wrong.  

Let's try a different approach.  We know he got 19 balls total.  Let's use that to figure out the number of balls in each set. 

* **Set 1:**  x + 4
* **Set 2:** x
* **Set 3:** x/2

We know the total is 19, so let's try to figure out what x is.

"Okay, so Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.  It loses value each year.  The car loses 21% of its value each year.  

To figure out how much the car is worth in 2010, we need to figure out how much it loses each year.

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car loses 21% of $20,000, which is $20,000 * 0.21 = $4,200.  So the car is worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car loses 21% of $15,800, which is $15,800 * 0.21 = $3,318.  So the car is worth $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car loses 21% of $12,482, which is $12,482 * 0.21 = $2,607.  So the car is worth $12,482 - $2,607 = $9,875.

"So, Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water a day.  To figure out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days, we need to know how many gallons are in 8 cups.  There are 16 cups in a gallon, so 8 cups is equal to 8/16 = 0.5 gallons.  If she drinks 0.5 gallons a day, in 30 days she'll drink 0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons.

"Okay, so Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. Then, 20 more get on at the first stop.  That's 120 + 20 = 140 people.  At the second stop, 50 people get off, and then 180 more get on.  That's 140 - 50 + 180 = 270 people.  Finally, 80 more get off at the third stop, so there are 270 + 80 = 350 people on the train. 

**Answer: 350**

"Okay, so Alison bought a tank top for $10. Then she got some shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.  She also got some tennis shoes that were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.  Finally, she got some socks for $8, and she got a coupon for $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks.  So, how much did she spend in total? 

**Answer:** $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $51

"Okay, so James' insurance went up because he had an accident.  To figure out how much he pays a year, we need to know how much it costs him now.

* **Normal cost:** $120 a month
* **Increased cost:** 60% of $120 is 60/100 * $120 = $72 more.
* **Total cost:** $120 + $72 = $192 a month.
* **Yearly cost:** $192 * 12 months = $2304 a year.

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"Imma has 3 cats and feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time.  To figure out how many days the food will last, we need to know how much food she uses each day.  She feeds them 60 grams per feeding, and she feeds them twice a day, so she uses 60 grams * 2 feedings = 120 grams of food each day.  To find out how many days the food will last, we divide the total amount of food (720 grams) by the amount she uses each day (120 grams): 720 grams / 120 grams/day = 6 days.  So the food will last for 6 days.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know the total time to make the meal was 98 minutes.
* Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan, so we need to figure out how long Donovan took.
* Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes. 
* Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.

So, together they took 'x' + ('x + 18') = 98 minutes.

Now we can solve for 'x':

* 2x + 18 = 98
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

That means Donovan took 40 minutes. 

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Okay, so the doctor charges $200 for the cast, $300 for a 30-minute visit, $4 per pill for 30 painkillers, and $6 for parking.  

To figure out the total cost, we need to add up all those prices. 

* **Visit:** $300 for 30 minutes is $300 / 60 minutes = $5 per minute.  So, the visit costs $5 * 0.5 hours = $2.50.
* **Painkillers:**  The painkillers cost $4 per pill * 30 pills = $120.
* **Parking:** The parking costs $6 per hour * 2 hours = $12.

So, the total cost is $200 + $2.50 + $120 + $12 = $334.50.

The total cost of the party is $125 + $246 = $371.

"Okay, so Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is like 1/4 of her money.  Riza spent one-third of her money, which is like 1/3 of her money.  They both had $60.  To find out how much money they have left, we need to figure out how much money they spent and then subtract that from their original amount.  They spent a total of $35.  So, they have $25 left. 

**Answer:** $25

"Jenny needs to pay $30 for 15 roses. She has $25.  She doesn't have enough money to buy the roses. 

**Answer:**  Jenny doesn't have enough money.

"Okay, let's figure out how much money Terry makes!

* **Milkshakes:** He sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, so that's 6 * $5.50 = $33.00
* **Burger Platters:** He sells 9 platters at $11 each, so that's 9 * $11 = $99.00
* **Sodas:** He sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, so that's 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

To find the total, we add all those amounts together: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

So, Terry makes $162.00 in total.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
* The second train comes 30 minutes after the first train, and stays for 10 minutes.
* The third train arrives an hour after the second train, and leaves right away.
* The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train.

"So, Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75% of the original price, which is $1500. Then, he sold it for 120% of that price, which is $1800.  To find out the discount, we need to figure out how much less the watch was sold for than the original price.  The difference is $200.  To figure out the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.  That gives us 10%. 


**Answer:** 10%

"If each spring makes 216,000 jellyfish in an hour, then in 4 hours, 5 springs would make 216,000 * 5 = 1,080,000 jellyfish.

"Okay, so Binkie bowled a 90.  To find out Frankie's score, we need to figure out how much better Frankie did than twice Binkie's score. 

Twice Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180. Then, Frankie scored 180 + 15 = 195. 

So, Frankie's score was 195.

"Jenny saved $2.00. 

Here's how to figure that out:

* **She bought 10 bunches of bananas.**  
* **Each bunch has 4 bananas.**
* **She paid $3.00 for each bunch.**
* **She bought bananas individually, so she paid $0.80 per banana.** 

Let me know if you want to try another problem!

"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence.  Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  To figure out how much is left for Sam, we need to figure out how much Sam has. 

Let's think about it like this:

*  If we know Harry has 60 feet more than Sam, we can say Harry has 100 feet of fence.
*  We can then figure out how much Sam has by subtracting 60 feet from Harry's fence.

"If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, it means it grows 2 inches each year.  To find out how much it grows in 13 years, we just multiply the growth per year by the number of years: 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches. 

So the answer is 26.

"Okay, so Marcel sells MTB, BMX, and Trekking bikes.  

* MTB bikes cost $500 each.
* BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, so they cost $500 / 2 = $250 each.
* Trekking bikes cost $450 each.

Marcel sold 300 bikes in total.  Half of them were Trekking bikes, which is 300 bikes / 2 = 150 bikes. 
Then, 15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, which is 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 bikes.

The rest of the bikes were MTB bikes, so there were 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

To figure out how much Marcel made, we need to multiply the number of each type of bike by its price and add them up.

* MTB: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
* BMX: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* Trekking: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

So, Marcel made a total of $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500 from selling bikes.

"Here's how to figure out the fourth child's height:

* **Second child's height:** The second child is 2 inches taller than the first, who is 6 feet tall. So, the second child is 6 feet + 2 inches = 6 feet 2 inches tall.
* **Third child's height:** The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall. So, the third child is 6 feet 2 inches - 5 inches = 6 feet 7 inches tall.
* **Fourth child's height:** The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall. So, the fourth child is 6 feet 7 inches + 3 inches = 6 feet 10 inches tall.
* **Convert to inches:** The fourth child is 6 feet 10 inches = 72 inches + 10 inches = 82 inches tall.

"Okay, so Tony's painting four walls.  We need to figure out how much paint he'll need and how much it'll cost.

* **East and West:** They're 5 feet by 8 feet each, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 square feet.
* **Total:**  The walls add up to 80 + 40 = 120 square feet.
* **Gallons:**  A gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so he'll need 120 / 20 = 6 gallons.
* **Cost:**  A gallon costs $12, so 6 gallons will cost 6 * $12 = $72.

To find her new balance, we need to add up all the new stuff she bought and then subtract the things she returned.  

* **New Purchases:** $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00
* **Total Balance:** $85.00 - $15.00 + $43.00 = $113.00

"Okay, so Lauren wants to save for retirement.  She saves 20% of her paycheck.  She wants to save for 20 years.  She also wants to live on 40% of her salary.  

To figure out how much she needs to save, we need to know how much she makes and how much she spends.  

* She makes $100,000 a year.
* She wants to spend 40% of that on living expenses.  That's $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000.

So, she has $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 left over each year to save.

To figure out how much she needs to save in total, we multiply that by the number of years she wants to save: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

So, she needs to save $1,200,000.  

To figure out how many years she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs to save by how much she saves each year: $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

*  We know there are 240 boys, so there are 600 people in total.
*  To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of people. 
*  So, there are 600 - 240 = 360 girls.

* Blue balls cost $5 each, so we multiply 11 by 5 to get $55.
* Green balls cost $3 each, so we multiply 25 by 3 to get $75.

Now, we add all those amounts together: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157. 

So the store will make $157.

"Okay, so Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.  Luis used half of those, and then gave the rest to Kris. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob.  To figure out how many stickers Seth had to start, we need to figure out how many stickers Kris had after giving some to Rob.  Kris had 9 stickers and got 7 from Rob, so he had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.  Since Luis used half of Seth's stickers, Seth had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.  So the answer is 32.

"Okay, so Rani wants to know the fastest car ever made.  She finds out the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.  The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which goes 120 miles per hour.  So, to find the fastest car, we need to figure out how fast the second fastest car is.  The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, which goes 120 mph.  So, the second fastest car goes 5 * 120 mph = 600 mph.  Then, we need to figure out how much faster the fastest car is. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, which goes 600 mph.  So, the fastest car goes 1.25 * 600 mph = 750 mph. 

**Answer:** 750 mph

"Let's break it down:

* Liam is 16 years old now.
* Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
* We know Liam was twice Vince's age two years ago.  That means Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.
* So, Vince is currently 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

"Okay, so we know Arnold and Madeline painted eggs together.  Let's say they painted 'x' eggs each.  

Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  

We can figure out how many eggs Sarah painted by thinking about the total number of eggs they painted together.  

*  Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs.
*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Sarah painted 30 - 12 = 18 eggs.

Now we know that Sarah painted 18 eggs.  

Let's think about Arnold and Madeline.  They painted 'x' eggs each, so they painted a total of 2x eggs. 

We know that the total number of eggs painted is 56.  So, we can set up an equation: 2x + 18 + 12 = 56. 

Let's solve for x: 
* 2x + 30 = 56
* 2x = 26
* x = 13

So, Arnold and Madeline painted 13 eggs each.  

Camden painted 23 eggs.  

To find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs, we subtract: 23 - 13 = 10. 


**Answer:** Camden painted 10 more eggs than Arnold.

"Okay, so Nik has 200 crayons. He wants to put them in boxes, and each box needs to hold 8 crayons.  He wants to know how much the whole thing weighs. 

First, he needs to figure out how many boxes he can fill.  200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes.

Then, he needs to figure out how much the boxes weigh. 25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces.

Now, he needs to figure out how much the crayons weigh. 200 crayons * 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces.

Finally, he needs to add up the weight of the crayons and the boxes. 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces.

And since there are 16 ounces in a pound, he needs to divide the total weight by 16. 400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = 25 pounds. 


**Answer:** 25 pounds

"Okay, so Grandma walks 3 miles a day.  She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  The sidewalk is twice as long as the beach, so she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk.  She spends 40 minutes on the beach.  How long does it take her to walk the whole 3 miles? 

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Beach time:** She walks 2 miles at a speed of 3 miles per day / 2 miles = 1.5 miles per hour.
* **Sidewalk time:** She walks 1 mile at twice the speed of the beach, so she walks 1 mile / 1.5 miles per hour = 0.67 hours.
* **Total time:**  She walks for 40 minutes, which is 40/60 = 2/3 of an hour.
* **Total time in minutes:** 2/3 of an hour is 2/3 * 60 minutes/hour = 40 minutes.

"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels, and each pack is $10.  He gets a 10% discount.  

To figure out how much each bagel costs, we need to do a few things:

* **Calculate the total cost:** 4 packs * $10/pack = $40.00
* **Calculate the discount:** $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00
* **Calculate the final price:** $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00
* **Calculate the price per bagel:** $36.00 / 9 bagels = $4.00/bagel

So, each bagel costs $4.00.

"If the ratio of men to women is 5:9, that means for every 5 men there are 9 women.  So, if there are 84 people on the bus, we need to figure out how many of those are men and how many are women. 

We know the total ratio parts are 5 + 9 = 14.  So, to find the number of men, we divide the total number of people by the total ratio parts: 84 / 14 = 6.  That means there are 6 men.

To find the number of women, we multiply the total ratio parts by the number of women in the ratio: 9 * 6 = 54 women.

Finally, we subtract the number of women who got off the bus: 54 - 20 = 34.

"To figure out how many days it takes Lauren to draw all the pictures, we need to figure out how many days it takes her to draw each type of picture. 

* **Large:** She can draw 5 large pictures a day, so it will take her 45 pictures / 5 pictures/day = 9 days to draw all the large pictures.
* **Medium:** She can draw 6 medium pictures a day, so it will take her 36 pictures / 6 pictures/day = 6 days to draw all the medium pictures.
* **Small:** She can draw 7 small pictures a day, so it will take her 49 pictures / 7 pictures/day = 7 days to draw all the small pictures.

Now, we add up the time for each type of picture: 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days. 

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to draw all the pictures.

"Okay, so Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, then another 140 miles in 3 hours.  To find his average speed, we need to figure out how fast he was going overall.

* **First leg:** He traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, so his speed was 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour.
* **Second leg:** He traveled 140 miles in 3 hours, so his speed was 140 miles / 3 hours = 46.67 miles per hour (that's a little over 46 miles per hour).
* **Total distance:** He traveled a total of 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.
* **Total time:** He traveled for 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.
* **Average speed:**  To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, his average speed was 50 miles per hour.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many more bottles Hortex needs to make to cover everyone's energy needs. 

* **Step 1:**  We know each bottle gives 20% of a person's daily energy.
* **Step 2:**  We need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover the energy of 2300 people.
* **Step 3:**  We can do this by multiplying the number of people by the energy they need per day. 

So, 2300 people * 0.20 = 460 bottles of juice are needed each day. 

* **Step 4:**  We need to figure out how many more bottles Hortex needs to make. 
* **Step 5:**  We can do this by subtracting the number of bottles they make from the number of bottles they need.

"Okay, so the avocado tree starts small, right?  It makes 50 fruits when it's 5 years old.  Then it gets bigger and makes more each year.  

* **Year 6:** It makes 3 times the amount it made in year 5, so 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
* **Year 7:** It makes 7 times the amount it made in year 5, so 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.
* **Year 8:** It makes 150 fruits less than in year 7, so 350 - 150 = 200 fruits.
* **Year 9:**  It doesn't make any fruits.
* **Year 10:** It makes 20 times the amount it made in year 5, so 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.

So, in total, the avocado tree makes 250 + 150 + 350 + 200 + 0 + 1000 = 2250 fruits.

"Okay, so we know the yellow rope is the longest, and the blue rope is shorter than the yellow rope by 7 centimeters.  We also know that the red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.  

Let's use some simple math to figure out the lengths!

*  Let's say the yellow rope is 'x' centimeters long.
*  The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

Now, all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.  So, we can write an equation:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Let's solve for 'x':

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12 

So, the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.

Now we can find the length of the red rope:

* The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, which is 'x - 7'.
* So, the red rope is 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

**Answer:** The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Okay, so the mural has red, white, purple, and yellow paint.  We know that the red, white, and purple paint are all the same amount.  Half the mural is yellow, so we know that's 6 pints.  Since the red, white, and purple paint are all the same amount, we can figure out how much of each color is used by dividing the total amount of paint by 4.  That means each color is 12 pints / 4 = 3 pints.  So, the red paint is 3 pints * 3 pints/color = 9 pints.

"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk and it cost him $3.5 per gallon.  But then he realized some of it was bad, like, really bad. He had to return it.  So, how much did he get back? 

Here's how to figure it out:

* **First, find out how much he spent on the milk:** 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000
* **Then, figure out how much milk was bad:** 4000 gallons * (2/5) = 1600 gallons
* **Finally, calculate the refund:** $14,000 - (1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon) = $14,000 - $5,600 = $8,400

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $8,400.

"Let's break this problem down!

* **Let's use letters to represent the ages:**
   *  Let Colin's current age be ""C""
   *  Let Wendy's current age be ""W""

* **We know Wendy is five times older than Colin will be in seven years:**
   *  W = 5(C + 7) 

* **In 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Let's use the first equation to help us:**
   *  We can substitute the first equation into the second equation. 
   *  This means we'll replace ""W"" with 5(C + 7) in the second equation.

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   *  C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)
   *  C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   *  C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   *  C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   *  C + 5 = (5/3)C
   *  (2/3)C = 5
   *  C = 25/2

So, he can buy 2 books per $500 * $9,000 / 3 schools = 600 books per school.

"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Start:**  Two apples fall.
* **First throw:**  One apple goes in his pocket, and one goes back into the tree.  That makes 5 more apples fall.
* **Second throw:**  Six more apples fall.
* **Final count:**  Newton picks up all the apples. 

So, he has to have brought home all the apples.

"Okay, so Kate eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.  To figure out how many pizzas she needs, we need to figure out how many of each kind she needs to buy. 

* **Cheese pizza:** She eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, and each pizza has 12 slices. So she needs 6 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas. Since you can't buy half a pizza, she needs to buy 1 cheese pizza.
* **Pepperoni pizza:** She eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, and each pizza has 8 slices. So she needs 4 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 0.5 pizzas.  She needs to buy 1 pepperoni pizza.

**Answer:** Kate needs to buy 1 cheese pizza and 1 pepperoni pizza.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Snowballs per minute:** Jay builds 1 snowball every 15 minutes.
* **Snowballs in 15 minutes:** He builds 1 snowball every 15 minutes, so in 15 minutes he builds 1 snowball.
* **Snowballs in 30 minutes:** He builds 2 snowballs in 15 minutes, so in 30 minutes he builds 2 * 2 = 4 snowballs.
* **Snowballs in 45 minutes:** He builds 4 snowballs in 30 minutes, so in 45 minutes he builds 4 * 2 = 8 snowballs.
* **Snowballs in 60 minutes:** He builds 8 snowballs in 45 minutes, so in 60 minutes he builds 8 * 2 = 16 snowballs.


**Answer:** 60 minutes

"Let's break this down!

* We know John is 28 years old now.
*  When Digimon came out, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old.
*  Since John was twice as old as Jim, Jim was 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

So the answer is 4.

"Okay, so Doxa cut an apple into 8 pieces.  She ate one slice. Her sister ate one more than her, so she ate 2 slices. Her brother ate one more than her sister, so he ate 3 slices.  To find the total, we add up all the slices: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.

"Okay, so they used 38 bandages on the first day, then 28 on the second, and then 50 on the third.  They had 78 left at the end of the third day.  To figure out how many they started with, we need to figure out how many bandages they used in total.  They used 38 + 28 + 50 = 116 bandages.  Then, we need to add the bandages they had left to find out how many they started with.  So, 116 + 78 = 194 bandages. 


**Answer:** 194

"So, May's hair started at 10 inches and got cut to 8 inches.  The haircut cost $30 per inch, so she paid $30 for the 2 inches she had cut.  The color cost $40.  So, the total cost was $30 + $40 = $70.

"Okay, so Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week, that's a lot of work!  She gets $1.50 an hour, and if she's always there, she gets an extra $10.  Since April has 4 weeks, we need to figure out how much she makes in total. 

* **Daily earnings:** 7.5 hours/day * $1.50/hour = $11.25/day
* **Weekly earnings:** $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week
* **Attendance bonus:** $10/week
* **Total earnings:** $67.50/week + $10/week = $77.50

So, Jen will get $77.50 for the month of April.

"Jason earned $8.00. Here's how we figure that out:

* **Dishwasher:** He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and each time he gets $0.50, so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00
* **Laundry:** He did his laundry once, and that costs $3.00.
* **Trash:** He took the trash out twice, and each time it costs $0.75, so that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
* **Cleaning:** He cleaned his room once, and that costs $1.50.

So, $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00

"Okay, so a whale has 40 gallons of blood.  A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has 3 * 40 gallons = 120 gallons.  If we have ten sharks, they would have 10 * 120 gallons = 1200 gallons of blood.

"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Morning:** 50 people came in the morning.
* **10:00:**  40 more people came in, so that's 50 + 40 = 90 people.
* **Lunch:**  Twice the number of people who came in at 10:00 means 90 * 2 = 180 people came in for lunch.
* **Evening:** Three times the number of people who came in the morning is 50 * 3 = 150 people.
* **Total:**  50 + 90 + 180 + 150 = 470 people

So the total number of people who came in the restaurant that day is 470.

"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and twice as many black pens.  So, she bought 5 packs * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.  Since each pack has 5 pens, she has 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens.  Finally, he has 5 packs of red pens * 5 pens/pack + 50 black pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

"Okay, so John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which costs 50% more than scotch.  To figure out how much he spends on cognac, we need to know how much each bottle of cognac costs.

* **Cognac cost:**  Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, each bottle costs 1.50 times the price of a scotch bottle. 
* **Number of cognac bottles:** John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.
* **Total cognac cost:**  He buys 20 bottles of cognac at $15 each, so the total cost is 20 * $15 = $300.
* **Total cost:**  John spends $600 on scotch plus $300 on cognac, so he spends $600 + $300 = $900 in total.

"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day.  He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more. That means he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.  

So, in total, he planted 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day. 

Finally, he planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees in two days.

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher's lounge.  

Let's use some simple math.  

* Let's say there are 'x' coffee mugs in the lounge.
* Four times that number is 4 * x 
* Eight more than that is 4x + 8

We know that 4x + 8 equals 40.  

So, we can solve for x:

4x + 8 = 40
4x = 32
x = 8

That means there are **8** coffee mugs in the lounge!

"Okay, so we know there are 66 fish in the tank.  One-third of them have red stripes, which is 66 / 3 = 22 fish. 

Then, the rest of the fish don't have red stripes, and 5/11 of those have blue stripes.  To find that number, we multiply 44 fish (the number that don't have red stripes) by 5/11.  That gives us 44 * (5/11) = 20 fish.

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with either stripes.  That's 22 + 20 = 42 fish.

"Here's how to figure out the roof height:

* **First floor:**  Mattison's house is 7 times taller than him, so the first floor is 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches.
* **Second floor:** The second floor is 7 times taller than the first floor, so it's 7 * 420 inches = 2940 inches.
* **Roof:** The roof is the top of the house, so it's the same height as the second floor minus the first floor.  That means the roof is 2940 inches - 420 inches = 2520 inches.


**Answer:** 2520

"Okay, so the tourists found 700 shells.  They split them up into three groups: Alphas, The Finders, and Gogetters.  Alphas found 40% of the shells, which is 280.  That leaves 420 shells.  The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 252.  So, how many did Gogetters find?

"The dogs need a total of 8 miles of walking per day.  To find out how many miles the last dog needs, we can subtract the miles the other dogs need from the total.  So, the last dog needs 8 - 3 = 5 miles.

"Deandre caught 3 tunas, and they all weigh a total of 128 kilograms. Each tuna costs $0.50 per kilogram. So, he'll make $64.00 from selling all the tunas.

"
"Here's how to figure out Trinity's profit:

* **She sells the magazines for 11/8 of what she paid.**  That means she sells them for $72 * (11/8) = $99.
* **To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price.**  So, her profit is $99 - $72 = $27. 

**Answer:** $27 
"
"Okay, so Brian's dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high.  

* **Low setting:** It takes 1 liter of water out of the air each day.
* **Medium setting:** It takes twice as much water as the low setting, so it takes 2 liters per day.
* **High setting:** It takes twice as much water as the medium setting, so it takes 4 liters per day.

He runs the low setting for 3 days, then the medium setting for 3 days, and finally the high setting for 5 days.  

To find the total amount of water removed, we need to add up the water removed from each setting:

* Low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
* Medium setting: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
* High setting: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

So, the total is 3 + 6 + 20 = **30 liters**

"Okay, so Jolene has 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons.  That's a total of 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.  But they only have 12 left, so they threw 300 - 12 = 288 balloons. 


**Answer:** 288

"Okay, so she needs 14 mL of one medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine.  That means she needs 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL of the second medicine.  So, in one dose, she uses 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.  If she does this for 8 doses, she'll use 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL. 

**Answer:** 448 mL 
"
"Okay, so Ali has one class with 120 students.  John has two classes, and each of those classes has 15 students.  To find the total, we just add the number of students in Ali's class and John's two classes.  That's 120 + (2 * 15) = 120 + 30 = 150 students. 

**Answer:** 150 
"
"Okay, so Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister.  He promised to pay back the $300 plus 2% extra.  That means he'll pay back $300 + (2/100)* $300 = $300 + $6.  

He'll pay $25 each month for 11 months, so he'll pay $25 * 11 = $275.  

So, in the 12th month, he'll pay $300 + $6 + $275 = $581.

"Okay, so the jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  That means the jar is a big box!  To figure out how many jelly beans are in there, we need to know how much space they take up.

First, we need to figure out the total space the jelly beans take up.  We know the jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall, so we can calculate the total space by multiplying those numbers together.

Then, we need to figure out how many jelly beans are in the jar.  We know that each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we can divide the total space by that number to find out how many jelly beans are in there.

Finally, we need to figure out how many jelly beans are red.  We know that 30% of the jelly beans are red.

Now, we know how many jelly beans are in the jar, and we know how many are red.

"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then, 40 more people get on.  Then another 3/4 of the people from the first stop get on.  So, that's 30 more people.  The bus is now at 90 people.  Then, the bus doubles the number of people on it.  So, it's 180 people.  The bus needs to have 20 more people to be full.

"So, they have 40 students in total, and they want to do this escape room thing with 8 people at a time.  They have 45 minutes to do it.  To figure out how long it will take, we need to figure out how many groups they can make.  

* 40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

Now, each group gets 45 minutes, so we just need to multiply that by the number of groups. 

* 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes 


 
**Answer:** 225 minutes

"Ali has to pay John $100. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* John made 4 tables that cost $20 each, so that's 4 * $20 = $80.
* He also made 2 roof frames that cost $10 each, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.
* To find the total cost, we add the cost of the tables and the roof frames: $80 + $20 = $100.

"Let's break this down!

* Ian has a board that's 40 feet long.
* He wants to cut it into two pieces.
* The longer piece is four times longer than the shorter piece.

To find the length of the longer piece, we need to figure out how long the shorter piece is first. 

Let's say the shorter piece is 'x' feet long.  The longer piece is then 4 times that, or 4x feet long.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so:

x + 4x = 40 feet

Combine the 'x' terms: 5x = 40 feet

Now, divide both sides by 5 to find the value of 'x':

x = 8 feet

The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.


**Answer: 32**

"Okay, so Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs.  He makes 16 meatballs per pound of beef.  To figure out how much beef he needs, we divide the number of meatballs by how many he makes per pound: 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of beef.  

Now, he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef.  So, he needs 10 tablespoons of seasoning. 


**Answer:** 10

"Luke needs to buy fabric for 5 windows, and each window is 35 inches wide.  He wants to buy twice the total width of all the windows, so he needs to buy fabric for 2 * 35 inches = 70 inches. 


**Answer:** 70 inches 
"
"So, you want to figure out how much a 36-minute call would cost. 

First, the price is $0.25 for the first 16 minutes.  That's like 16 times $0.25.  Then, the price drops to $0.20 for the next 20 minutes.  That's like 20 times $0.20.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first part and the cost of the second part. 

So, the total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

"On Tuesday, it's expected to rain 5 inches. 

**Answer:** 5

"Let's figure this out!

We know Carly made brownies and cupcakes for her art class.  She made 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes.  

* Let's say Carly made 'c' cupcakes.
*  She made 'b' brownies.

We know that b = 3c - 2.

The class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

To find out how many cupcakes she made, we need to figure out what 'c' is.

We can do this by using the equation b + c = 10.

Let's substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

(3c - 2) + c = 10

Now, let's solve for 'c':

4c - 2 = 10

"Okay, so the manicure is $35 and the pedicure is $40.  They're giving a discount if you get both, so that's $43. Then, nail art is $3 per nail, and she wants it on all her fingers, so that's $30.  So, the total is $73.

"Okay, so we know Samantha has 27 paintings.  We also know she has 12 fewer than Shelley.  Shelley has 8 more than Kim.  Let's figure out how many paintings Kim has. 

To do that, we need to figure out how many paintings Shelley has.  We know Shelley has 8 more than Kim, so we can write that as Shelley = Kim + 8.

Now we know Samantha has 27 paintings, and she has 12 fewer than Shelley.  So, we can write that as Samantha = Shelley - 12.  We can plug in Shelley = Kim + 8 to get Samantha = (Kim + 8) - 12.

Now we can solve for Kim.  We know Samantha has 27 paintings, so (Kim + 8) - 12 = 27.  Let's solve for Kim.  We can add 12 to both sides to get Kim + 8 = 39.  Then, we can subtract 8 from both sides to get Kim = 31.


**Answer: Kim has 31 paintings.**

"To find the mean, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by how many scores there are. 

Here's how:

* **Add up all the scores:** 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 570
* **Divide the sum by the number of scores:** 570 / 9 = 63.33

So the mean score is 63.33.

"Eve had 20 pomelos. She gave some away, and now she has 5 left.  To find out how many she gave away, we need to find the difference between the starting amount and the amount she has left.  So, she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.

"Let's break it down:

* Madeline ate 6 grapes.
* Her brother used 5 times that amount, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
* Together they used 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
* The problem says they used all the grapes, so there were 0 grapes left.
* The mother used 0 grapes for the pies.


**Answer:** 0

"Okay, so Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week.  He spends $1.00 on pasta and $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount for gruyere cheese.  To figure out how much he spends in a year, we need to add up all the cheese costs.  

* **Gruyere cost:** He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and twice that amount for gruyere is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00
* **Total cheese cost:** The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00
* **Yearly cost:**  He makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in a year he makes 52 weeks * $9.00/week = $468.00

So, Bud spends $468.00 on making macaroni and cheese in a year.

"Okay, so Skyler has 100 hats. Half of them are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats. 

He has 50 - 30 = 20 hats left.  Since 3/5 of the rest are blue, that means 3/5 * 20 = 12 blue hats.

So, Skyler has 20 - 12 = 8 white hats.

"Okay, so Archie buys beef jerky for $18.00, but it's on sale for $3.00 off.  That means the jerky is $15.00.  

To figure out how much each stick costs, we need to divide the total price by the number of sticks.  There are 30 sticks in a bag.

So, each stick costs $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.

And since there are 100 cents in a dollar, each stick costs 50 cents. 


**Answer:** 50 cents

"Okay, so Audrey has to get 70% on both tests to move on to 7th grade.  The first test is 70 questions, and she got 60% of them right.  That means she got 60/100 * 70 = 42 questions right.  She needs to get 70% of the second test right, which is 70/100 * 40 = 28 questions.  So, she needs to get 28 questions right on the second test.

"Let's figure this out!

We know Mary makes strawberry ice cubes and blueberry ice cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  We also know that Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's use that information to find out how many blueberry cubes she makes.

* Let's say Mary makes 'x' number of strawberry cubes.
* The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which is 5x - 4.
* The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes, which is x + (5x - 4) = 116.

Now we can solve for x:

* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

* The number of blueberry cubes is 5 * 20 - 4 = 96.

**Answer: 96**

"It will take 30 minutes longer for the varnish to dry on all 6 paintings. 

Here's how we know:

* The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting.
* If we have 6 paintings, it will take 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes to dry all of them.
* The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting.
* So, the new varnish takes 72 minutes - 7 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes longer.

"Crista needs 12 cups of water for her plants. 
 
Here's how we figure that out:

* Some plants need a full cup: 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups
* The rest of the plants need a quarter cup: 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants
* The quarter cup plants need 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups
*  So, 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups

"Okay, so Conor goes to the beach every day.  On the first day, there were 50 people.  The next day, there were 20 more people, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.  Then on the third day, there were twice as many people as the second day, so there were 70 * 2 = 140 people.  So far, Conor saw 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.  The rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day, so he saw 60 * 5 = 300 people.  In total, Conor saw 260 + 300 = 560 people at the beach that week. 

**Answer:** 560

"Okay, so the popcorn starts popping fast at first, right?  It pops 20 kernels in the first 30 seconds. Then, it pops three times as many in the next 30 seconds.  Then, it pops four times as many in the next 30 seconds.  Finally, it pops half as many in the last 30 seconds.  

After that, some of the popcorn keeps popping from the heat, like a little bit of magic!  So, how many kernels does Garrett have to eat? 

**Answer:** 440 kernels

"They need 21 kilograms of dog food in a week. 

**Answer:** 21 
"
"Here's how to figure out the total number of legs:

* **Two-legged animals:** 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs
* **Four-legged animals:** 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs
* **Total legs:** 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

So the answer is 80. 


"
"Let's break it down:

* We know there are 4 blue blocks.
* The tower has twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.
* That means there are 12 blue and yellow blocks in total.
* To find out how many red blocks there are, we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

So, there are **20** red blocks. 
"
"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's 5 * 18 = 90 miles. Then he drives east for 8 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 8 * 18 = 144 miles.  To find out how far he is from his house, we need to add those two distances together.  That's 90 + 144 = 234 miles.  So the answer is 234 miles. 


 
"
"Okay, so Gary bought a boat for $9000.  The first year it lost 30% of its value, which is like taking off 30 dollars for every 100 dollars.  So, it lost $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  That leaves him with $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

The second year, it lost another 30% of its value, which is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  So, it's worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

The last year, it lost 20% of its value, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  So, it's worth $4410 - $882 = $3528. 

So the boat is worth $3528 after three years. 


 
"
"Okay, so the bag has 232 candies total.  We know there are 54 red candies.  To find out how many orange candies there are, we double the number of red candies, which is 54 * 2 = 108.  Then, we find out how many yellow candies there are by dividing the number of red candies by 2, which is 54 / 2 = 27.  So, we have 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  To find out how many pink candies there are, we subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies, which is 232 - 189 = 43. 


**Answer:** 43 
"
"Okay, so Helen went on a trip to Germany for 3 nights. She took the bus 7 times.  

* **Hotel:** She stayed at a hotel for 3 nights, and it cost $80 per night. So, the hotel cost her $80 * 3 = $240.
* **Bus:** Each bus ride cost $8, and she took the bus 7 times. So, the bus trips cost $8 * 7 = $56.
* **Total:** To find the total cost, we add the hotel and bus costs: $240 + $56 = $296.

**Answer:** $296 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping some.
* To find out how many he had before dropping any, we add 4 to get 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.
* Mazie gave Darla the rest of the marbles, so she gave Darla 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

**Answer:** 27 
"
"Okay, so they go to the movies.  They buy adult tickets, child tickets, and popcorn.  

* **Adult tickets:** 1 adult * $12/ticket = $12
* **Child ticket:** 1 child * $8/ticket = $8
* **Popcorn:** 2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6

To find the total cost, we add all those up: $12 + $8 + $6 = $26

So the answer is **26**. 
"
"Okay, so John's car is heavy!  It weighs 1200 pounds, and that's just the car itself.  Then he's got 250 pounds of luggage, and two kids who weigh 75 pounds each, so that's another 150 pounds.  To move the car, he needs to push with a force that's 1% of the total weight.  So, we need to figure out how much that is.  

The total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.  And 1% of that is 0.01 times 1600, which is 16 pounds. 

**Answer:** 16 pounds 
"
"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to know how long the fence is and how wide it is.  

* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all the sides added together. 
* **Calculation:**  We need to add up the length and width of the fence. 
* **Answer:**  The fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide. So, we need to add those together: 20 feet + 15 feet = 35 feet. 
* **Answer:** James needs 35 feet of crepe paper. 


"
"Here's how to solve this:

* We know Mia is younger than Emma, and they are 16 years apart.
* Mia is 40 years old.
* To find Emma's age, we add 16 to Mia's age: 40 + 16 = 56
* To find the average, we add their ages and divide by 2: (40 + 56) / 2 = 48

**Answer:** 48

"Okay, so Avery needs 3 place settings for each of her 12 guests.  That means she needs 36 place settings total. 

* Dinner plates cost $6 each, so she'll spend 36 * $6 = $216 on those.
* Bowls cost $5 each, so she'll spend 36 * $5 = $180 on those.
* Salad plates cost $4 each, so she'll spend 36 * $4 = $144 on those.

To find the total cost, we add all those up: $216 + $180 + $144 = $540. 

So the answer is $540.

"Okay, so James has a quarter, two nickels, and seven dimes.  Let's figure out how much that's worth in cents!

* A quarter is worth 25 cents.
* Two nickels are worth 2 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 10 cents.
* Seven dimes are worth 7 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 70 cents.

So, in total, James has 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.

"Octavia is making a quilt!  She has some t-shirts to use.  She has 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts.  To figure out how much fabric she has, we need to add up the area of each type of shirt.  

* Small shirts are 3 square feet each.
* Medium shirts are 4 square feet each.
* Large shirts are 6 square feet each.

So, she has 11 * 3 = 33 square feet of small shirts.
She has 8 * 4 = 32 square feet of medium shirts.
She has 6 * 6 = 36 square feet of large shirts.

To find the total, we add all the squares together: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet. 

**Answer:** 101

* **Anne's height:** Anne is twice as tall as Albert, who is 36 inches. So Anne is 2 * 36 = 72 inches tall.
* **Jackie's height after summer:** Jackie grew 3 inches, so she's now 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall.
* **Jackie's height before summer:**  To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to subtract the 3 inches she grew. So, she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall.

**Answer:** 67

"Okay, so Ryan gets $6 a week for chores and he did them for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18. Then he buys ice cream for himself and 3 friends, and that costs $1.25 per person, so it's $1.25 * 4 = $5. Then the tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $21.75 / $6.50 = 3.3 tickets.  Since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy **3** tickets. 


"
"Okay, so Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a picture frame for $5.  Lani got sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each.  

To find the total, we need to add up all the prices. 

* Ellen's stuff: $100 + $5 = $105
* Lani's stuff: $30 + (2 * $100) = $30 + $200 = $230
* Total: $105 + $230 = $335

So, they spent $335 in total.

"Josh services 3 cars a day, and he works 5 days a week.  That means he services 3 cars * 5 days = 15 cars a week.  He gets $4 for each car, so he makes $4 * 15 cars = $60 a week.  In two weeks, he'll make $60 * 2 = $120.

"Okay, so Randy starts with 18 cookies. He eats some, then gives some to his friends, and then bakes more. Let's figure out how many he has left. 

* He eats 3 cookies total.
* He gives away 2 cookies.
* He bakes 4 of each kind of cookie.

So, he has 18 - 3 - 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 cookies left.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Holes dug:** Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so he digs 6 * 14 = 84 holes.
* **Holes filled:** Nate fills 9 holes a day, so in 14 days he fills 9 * 14 = 126 holes.
* **Holes dug each night:** The dog digs 6 holes each night.
* **Total holes dug each day:** The dog digs 6 holes a night * 14 nights = 84 holes.
* **Time to fill:**  Nate fills 126 holes, and the dog digs 84 holes each day, so it will take him 126 / 84 = 1.5 weeks.


**Answer:** 1.5 weeks

"The answer is 1000. 

Here's why:

* Butler High School has 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School.
* To find the difference, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School. 
* 4000 - 3000 = 1000

"They made 7995 cookies in total. They have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.  To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies. 

So, 7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2225 

They made 2225 chocolate chip cookies.

"Okay, so Igor had to put some stuff on the lab bench.  He got 16 test tubes, 14 Petri dishes, and some beakers.  He got half the test tubes he was supposed to, which is 8.  He also got 2 more Petri dishes than he was supposed to, which is 16.  He had 29 items in total.  To figure out how many beakers he lost, we need to figure out how many he had to start with.  We know he had 29 items in total, and he had 8 test tubes, 16 Petri dishes, and some beakers.  We can figure out how many beakers he had by subtracting the number of items he had from the total number of items.  So, he had 29 - 8 - 16 = 5 beakers.  He lost 5 beakers.

"If there are 10 eggs in one basket and twice as many in another, we need to find the total number of eggs.  So, we double the number of eggs in the first basket, which is 10 eggs * 2 = 20 eggs. Then, we add the eggs from both baskets to get the total: 10 eggs + 20 eggs = 30 eggs. 

**Answer:** 30

"Okay, so we need to find out how much money the girls raised in total. 

* Alexandra makes $430.
* Kim makes $320 more than Alexandra, so she makes $430 + $320 = $750.
* Maryam makes $400 more than Sarah, who makes $300. So Maryam makes $400 + $300 = $700.
* To find the total, we add up all their earnings: $750 + $700 + $300 = $1750.

So the answer is $1750.

"The caretaker needs 606 feet of line.  Here's how we figure that out:

* **He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.**  
* **He has 200 feet of dock.**
* **So, he needs 200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet of line.**
* **He already has 6 feet of line.**
* **To find the total, we add the new line to the old line: 600 feet + 6 feet = 606 feet**

"Okay, so Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.  They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  To figure out how much they make, we need to know how much they make per night and then how much they make in two nights. 

* **Cost of meals:** 2 meals * $5/meal = $10
* **Total cost per night:** $10 + $5 = $15
* **Total cost for 2 days:** $15/night * 2 nights = $30
* **Total weekly earnings:** $30/night * 2 nights = $60

So, Tom's restaurant makes $60 a week.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find James's age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. James is twice her age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **Find John's age:** James was born when John was 19, so John is currently 19 + 32 = 51 years old.
* **Find the youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is currently 32 years old. In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

**Answer:** 35
