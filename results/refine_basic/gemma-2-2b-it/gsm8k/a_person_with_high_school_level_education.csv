"Let's break it down:

* We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
* Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
* Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
* To find the total, add the sheep from each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

"Okay, so Carla's download is 200 GB.  She's getting it at 2 GB per minute.  But then Windows makes her restart because it needs to install updates.  That takes 20 minutes.  Then she has to start over.  So, how long does it take to download the whole thing? 

Here's how to figure it out:

* **First, figure out how long she downloads before the restart:** 
   * 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB.
   * That means she downloads for 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.
* **Then, add the time spent restarting:**
   *  She has to restart, so that takes 20 minutes.
* **Now, figure out how long it takes to download the rest of the file:**
   * She has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.
   * That means she downloads 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.
* **Finally, add up all the time:**
   * 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

**So, it takes Carla 120 minutes to download the file.**

"Okay, so John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, then turns around because he forgot something. He tries to get home in 4 hours but gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours. He then drives at 30 mph for 30 minutes, and then speeds up to 80 mph for the rest of the drive. 

To figure out how far he is from home, we need to figure out how far he traveled in each part of his trip. 

* **First part:** He drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so he travels 60 miles per hour * 3 hours = 180 miles.
* **Second part:** He drives for 4 hours, but gets stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he drives for 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours. He travels at 80 mph for 2 hours, so he travels 80 miles per hour * 2 hours = 160 miles.
* **Third part:** He drives for 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours. He travels at 30 mph for 0.5 hours, so he travels 30 miles per hour * 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

Now, let's add up all the miles he traveled: 180 miles + 160 miles + 15 miles = 355 miles.

**Answer:** 355 miles

"Okay, so Eliza works 40 hours at $10 an hour, that's $400. Then she works 5 more hours at overtime pay, which is 1.2 times her regular rate, so that's $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  She gets paid $12/hour for those extra 5 hours, so that's $12 * 5 = $60.  Finally, she gets $400 for her regular hours plus $60 for overtime, so her total earnings are $460.

"To figure out how long it takes Carlos to start making money, we need to see how much he earns each year and how much it costs to take care of the tree. 

* **Earnings:** He gets $1.50 per lemon, and he gets 7 lemons each year, so he makes $1.50 * 7 = $10.50 per year.
* **Expenses:** It costs $3 to water and feed the tree each year.
* **Profit:**  He makes $10.50 and spends $3, so he makes $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 each year.

To make money, he needs to make more than his expenses.  So, it will take him 2 years to start making money.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's use variables:** Let 'x' be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
* **Green House:** She sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she had (2/3)x left.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more at the red house than the green house, so she sold (1/3 + 2) = 5/3 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, which means she sold (1/3 + 5/3) / 2 = 2 vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
* **Total Sold:**  She sold a total of 1/3x + 5/3x + 2 = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners.
* **Remaining:** She has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (2x/3) = 5.
* **Solve for x:** Multiply both sides by 3 to get 2x = 15. Divide both sides by 2 to get x = 7.5.

**Answer:** Melanie started with 7.5 vacuum cleaners.

"So, first we figure out how many students took contemporary dance.  20% of 20 students is 4 students.  Then, we subtract those students from the total to find the number of students who didn't take contemporary.  That leaves us with 16 students.  

Next, 25% of the remaining students, or 4 students, took jazz dance.  

Finally, we subtract the jazz dancers from the remaining students to find the number who took hip-hop.  That's 12 students.

To find the percentage of students who took hip-hop, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students and multiply by 100%.  That gives us 60%.

"So, Kyle got the book for $19.50, and that's after a 25% discount.  To figure out the original price, we need to figure out what the price was before the discount. 

Think about it like this: the discount is like taking off a part of the original price.  

Let's say the original price was 'x'.  The discount is 25% of 'x', which is 0.25x.

We know that the sale price is $19.50, so we can set up an equation:

x - 0.25x = $19.50

Now, let's solve for x:

0.75x = $19.50
x = $19.50 / 0.75
x = $26.00

**So, the original price of the book was $26.00**

* **Let's use variables:** Let Darrell's current age be represented by '7x' and Allen's current age by '11x'.

* **Set up an equation:**  7x + 11x = 162

* **Solve for x:** 18x = 162, so x = 162 / 18 = 9

* **Allen's age in 10 years:** Allen's age in 10 years will be 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109


**Answer:** Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"Let's break this down:

* We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total.
*  She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of silver coins.  This means Gretchen has x + 30 gold coins.

So, we can set up an equation:

110 = x + (x + 30)

Now, let's solve for 'x':

110 = 2x + 30
80 = 2x
x = 40

Since x represents the number of silver coins, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70

**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and they're on sale for $5.00 for 4 yogurts.  To figure out how much he spends in 30 days, we need to figure out how much he spends on one yogurt and then multiply that by the number of yogurts he eats in a day. 

So, he buys 4 yogurts for $5.00. That means each yogurt costs $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt. 

Over 30 days, he'll spend $1.25/yogurt * 30 yogurts = $37.50.

"Okay, so the bag of chips has 250 calories per serving and you have 5 servings.  You want to know how many grams you can eat if you've already eaten 1800 calories. 

First, figure out how many calories are in the chips: 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories.

Then, you need to figure out how many calories you have left to eat: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

"Okay, so Marcy works for 40 years and gets $50,000 a year.  After 20 years, she gets 5% of that amount each year.  So, after 20 years, she gets $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 extra each year.

Now, she works for another 10 years.  So, her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 * 10 = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000. 

So, her final annual pension is $75,000.

"Okay, so the streaming service charges $140 a month.  

* The first half of the year costs $140 * 6 months = $840.
* They then charge 10% less for the second half, so it's $140 - $14 = $126.
*  The total cost for the year is $840 + $126 = $966. 

So the answer is $966.

"Sophia can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas.  Here's how we figure that out:

* **Think about it like this:**  She used 4 gallons of gas to go 100 miles.
* **To find out how many miles she can go on a full tank, we need to know how many miles she can go with 12 gallons.**
* **We can do this by dividing the miles she traveled by the amount of gas she used:** 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.
* **Now, we multiply that by the amount of gas in her tank:** 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

"Okay, so Sylvie has been working at the company for 5 years.  That means she gets a raise every year.  

To figure out her salary after 3 more years, we need to figure out how much her salary will be after 3 years.

* **Year 2:** She gets another 10% raise on her $660 salary, so she gets $660 * 1.10 = $726.
* **Year 3:** She gets another 10% raise on her $726 salary, so she gets $726 * 1.10 = $798.60.

So, her salary after 3 more years will be $798.60.

"Let's break this down:

* We know Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald.
* Together they sold 88,000 copies.

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of copies Harald sold.  Since Marilyn sold 10 times as many as Harald, she sold 10x copies.

Their total sales are x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get 11x = 88,000

To find out how many copies Harald sold, we need to solve for 'x'.  Divide both sides of the equation by 11:

x = 88,000 / 11

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"Let's break this down:

* **Let's say Gerald's original time is 'x' seconds.**
* **Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee's time is 'x + 2' seconds.**
* **We know Lee ran the race in 38 seconds.**  This means 'x + 2' = 38.
* **To find Gerald's new time, we need to figure out what 'x' is.**  We can do this by solving the equation 'x + 2 = 38'.
* **Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us 'x = 36'.**
* **Now we can find Gerald's new time.  His new time is 'x + 0.1x' which is 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.**

**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

* **Let's use variables:**  We can use 'x' to represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* **Set up an equation:**  He wants to make twice as many cookies this year, so this year he baked 2x cookies.  He baked 15 more than he intended, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies.  After dropping 5, he has 110 cookies.  So, 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

* **Solve for x:**
    * 2x + 10 = 110
    * 2x = 100
    * x = 50

"Here's how to solve this:

We know the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.

We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find out how many cups of water she used, we need to figure out how many parts of the ratio represent the sugar.

*  We can set up a proportion: 7 parts of sugar = 120 teaspoons
*  To find the value of one part, we can divide the total teaspoons by the number of parts: 120 teaspoons / 7 = 17.14 teaspoons per part.

Now, we know that 17.14 teaspoons represent one part of the ratio.  To find out how many cups of water she used, we can multiply that value by the number of parts of the ratio.

*  Since the ratio is 7:13, we can multiply 17.14 teaspoons per part by 13 to find the number of cups of water. 

**Answer:** Katy used approximately 222.82 cups of water.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Convert everything to feet:**  We need to make sure everything is in feet, since we're comparing distances.  Steve lives 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet away. Tim lives 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet away.
* **Calculate Steve's time:** Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, so to figure out how long it takes him to get home, we divide the distance by his speed: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.
* **Calculate Tim's time:** Tim can skateboard at 264 feet per minute, so we divide the distance by his speed: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.
* **Find the difference:**  To find out how long it will take for the loser to finish, we subtract Tim's time from Steve's time: 36 minutes - 40 minutes = -4 minutes. 

**Answer:** The winner will be waiting at their house for **4** minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of Dave's fries, so he ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* **Pigeons' feast:** Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, totaling 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* **Remaining fries:** After the pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.
* **Raccoon's grab:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 5.
* **Final count:** The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Answer:** There were 7 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

"Okay, so Kimo has classes three times a week for an hour each, that's 3 hours a day, and he does that three days a week.  Then he has two classes for two hours each on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so that's 8 hours a week.  He has classes for 16 weeks, so we need to add up the hours from each day.  That's 3 hours a day * 3 days a week + 8 hours a week = 272 hours. 

**Answer:** 272 
"
"Okay, so Bill bakes a lot of bread!  Let's figure out how long all of it is. 

* He bakes 300 rolls, each 4 inches long, so that's 300 * 4 = 1200 inches.
* He bakes 120 croissants, each 6 inches long, so that's 120 * 6 = 720 inches.
* And he bakes 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long, which is 60 * 2 * 12 = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add all those lengths up: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet.  3360 inches is equal to 3360 / 12 = 280 feet. 


**Answer:** 280 feet

"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times, covering 100 yards each time, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards. Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times, covering 40 yards each time, so she runs 34 * 40 = 1360 yards.  To find out how much farther Blake ran, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance: 1500 - 1360 = 140 yards.

"Here's how to figure out the price:

* **The price goes up by 20% every two months.**  That means each time the price goes up, it's like adding 20% of the original price.
* **We need to figure out how much the price increases over 36 months.** 
* **Let's calculate:** 
    * 20% of $20 is $4.
    * The price increases by $4 every two months.
    * 36 months is 18 times 2 months. 
    * So, the price increases by $4 * 18 = $72. 

**The price of the bag of marbles after 36 months will be $20 + $72 = $92.**

"Jackie has to decide if she should do her taxes herself or hire a professional.  If she does her taxes herself, she'll lose 3 hours of freelance work, which means she'll miss out on $35 per hour. The accountant charges $90.  To figure out if hiring the accountant is better, we need to see how much money she'd make by doing her taxes herself versus how much she'd pay the accountant. 

Here's how to figure that out:

* **If she does her taxes herself:** She'll lose $35/hour * 3 hours = $105 in freelance work.
* **If she hires the accountant:** She'll pay $90.

So, she'll lose $105 if she does her taxes herself, and she'll save $90 if she hires the accountant. 

**Answer:**  Hiring the accountant will save Jackie $90.

"Let's break this down:

* Let Seth's current age be ""S""
* Let Brooke's current age be ""B""

We know:

* S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

We can use these equations to solve for their ages.

**Let's use the first equation to find S:**
* S = 2B

**Now, let's substitute this into the second equation:**
* (2B) + B + 2 = 28

**Simplify the equation:**
* 3B + 2 = 28

**Solve for B:**
* 3B = 26
* B = 8.67 (approximately)

**Now that we know Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age:**
* S = 2B
* S = 2 * 8.67
* S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Zaid spends a lot of money.  He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and then gives half of what's left to charity.  He also gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700.

First, let's figure out how much money he has left after all those expenses.

* **Rent:** 6000$ * (1/4) = 1500$
* **Car Fuel:** 6000$ * (1/3) = 2000$
* **Total Expenses:** 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$
* **Money Remaining:** 6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$
* **Charity Donation:** 2500$ / 2 = 1250$
* **Money After Charity:** 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$
* **Total Given to Daughter and Wife:** 200$ + 700$ = 900$
* **Final Remaining Money:** 1250$ - 900$ = 350$

So, Zaid has **350$** left.

"Okay, so the faster team is really good!  They're all running 55 seconds each.  The other team is a little slower.  The first runner is 60 seconds, then each person after that is 3 seconds faster.  So, the second runner is 60 + 3 = 63 seconds, the third is 63 + 3 = 66 seconds, and the fourth is 66 + 3 = 69 seconds.  That's a total of 258 seconds for the slower team.  The faster team is only 220 seconds.  The faster team wins by 38 seconds!

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Think about the possibilities:**  There are 6 sides on a die, so there are 6 possible outcomes.
* **What's the chance of getting a number greater than 3?**  There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6). So, the chance of getting one of those is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.
* **What's the chance of getting two even numbers in a row?**  There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6).  The chance of getting an even number on the first roll is 3/6, and the chance of getting another even number on the second roll is also 3/6. So, the chance of getting two even numbers in a row is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36.
* **Find the difference:**  The chance of getting a number greater than 3 is 1/2, and the chance of getting two even numbers in a row is 9/36.  The difference is 1/2 - 9/36. 
* **Simplify:**  To make the difference easier to understand, we can simplify 1/2 - 9/36.  The fraction 1/2 is equal to 18/36.  So, 18/36 - 9/36 = 9/36.  
* **Convert to a percentage:**  9/36 is equal to 1/4.  To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100%.  1/4 * 100% = 25%.


**Answer:** It's 25% more likely to get a number greater than 3 than to get two even numbers in a row.

"Let's break it down: Jenna's mom picked 20 apples.  Since Jenna picked half as many, she picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.  Together they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples. 

**Answer:** 30

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Hamsters:** We know 10 cages of hamsters get 5 pieces of straw each, so that's 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw used with hamsters.
* **Rats:** We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total, and we've already accounted for the hamsters, so we need to figure out how many rats were used. 160 - 50 = 110 pieces of straw are left for the rats.
* **Rats per cage:**  We divide the total straw for the rats (110) by the number of rats (we'll need to figure that out) to find out how many rats are in each cage. 

**Answer:**  We need to figure out how many rats there are.

"Mandy needs to pay Benedict $102. Here's why:

* **Interest:**  They agreed on 2% interest per month. 
* **Calculation:**  Over 3 months, the interest would be $100 * 0.02 = $2.
* **Total:**  To find the total amount, add the interest to the original amount: $100 + $2 = $102.

"Here's how to figure out how many bags the trader sold:

* **Cost:** The farmer sold the bags for $20 each, and the trader had to pay $2 to transport each bag.  So, the trader spent 20 * x + 2 * x = 22x dollars on the bags.
* **Revenue:** The trader sold the bags for $30 each, so he made 30 * x dollars.
* **Profit:** The trader made a profit of $400.  This means the total revenue from selling the bags minus the total cost of buying the bags equals $400.  So, 30x - 22x = 400.
* **Solve for x:**  We can simplify the equation to 8x = 400.  Divide both sides by 8 to get x = 50.

**Answer:** The trader sold 50 bags.

"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets, and then $4.50 less on food, so that was $15.75. Then they spent $66 on two rides.  To find out how much each person paid, we need to add up all the costs and then divide by three.  The total cost was $102.00.  So, each person paid $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

"John collects 360 peaches. 
 
Here's how we figure that out:

* **He works for 3 hours.**  
* **He collects 2 peaches per minute.**
* **To find the total peaches, we multiply the number of minutes he works by the number of peaches he collects per minute.** 

So, 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes
180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

"To figure out how much insect food the ducks need each day, we need to figure out how much they eat in a week and then divide that by the number of days in a week. 

So, they need 35 pounds of insects per week.  Since there are 7 days in a week, they need 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds of insects per day. 

**Answer:** 5 pounds

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Trees planted:** Tom plants 10 trees each year for 10 years, so he plants a total of 10 * 10 = 100 trees.
* **Trees chopped down:** He chops down 2 trees each year for 10 years, so he chops down 2 * 10 = 20 trees.
* **Total trees:**  He starts with 50 trees and plants 100 more, so he has 50 + 100 = 150 trees.
* **Trees that die:**  30% of the trees die, so 150 * 0.30 = 45 trees die.
* **Trees remaining:**  He has 150 - 45 = 105 trees left.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Saturday's change:** The neighbors took back 1/3 * 18 flamingos = 6 flamingos.
* **Flamingos remaining after Saturday:** They had 18 flamingos - 6 flamingos = 12 flamingos left.
* **Sunday's addition:** They added 18 more pink flamingos, bringing the total to 12 + 18 = 30 flamingos.
* **The difference:**  They had 30 pink flamingos - 12 white flamingos = 18 more pink flamingos.

* A pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser combined.
* A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30.
* So, a pencil and eraser cost $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50
* Since a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser, a pen costs $1.50.
* 8 pens would cost $1.50 * 8 = $12.00

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Total carrots needed:**  We need to give carrots to 40 restaurants, and each restaurant gets 2 pounds, so we multiply 40 by 2. That's 80 pounds of carrots.
* **Leftover carrots:** We have 200 pounds of carrots in total, and we're giving out 80, so we subtract to find the leftover. 200 - 80 = 120 pounds.

"There are 6277 children in Soda.

"Okay, so Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.  She gets three times that amount in the first month, so she has 20 * 3 = 60 cards. Then, in the second month, she gets 20 fewer than that, so she has 60 - 20 = 40 cards.  

In the third month, she gets twice the number from the first and second months, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.  Finally, she gets 100 * 2 = 200 cards in the third month. 

So, in total, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, and Publisher B pays him twice that amount.  So, Publisher B pays him 10 cents per sentence.  

To find out how much he makes from Publisher A, we multiply the number of sentences he edits by the rate per sentence: 1000 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents.

To find out how much he makes from Publisher B, we multiply the number of sentences he edits by the rate per sentence: 1000 sentences * 10 cents/sentence = 10000 cents.

Finally, to find his total earnings, we add the earnings from both publishers: 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Morning:** Baldur gets 5 pails * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters of water.
* **Afternoon:** He gets 6 pails * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters of water.

"Okay, so John wins this award and gets a $5000 bonus.  Then they get a 5% raise on top of that.  He makes $2000 a week, and he works all year.  

To figure out how much he makes, we need to figure out how much his raise is.  A 5% raise is like getting 5 out of every 100 dollars.  So, his raise is $5000 * 0.05 = $250.

Now, his new salary is $2000 + $250 = $2250.

Finally, he makes $2250 * 52 weeks = $115,000 for the year.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the weight of a candied apple:**  The problem tells us each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, and a chocolate bar weighs 40g. So, a candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.
* **Calculate the total weight of the candied apples:** Joe has 80 candied apples, and each weighs 20g, so the total weight is 80 * 20 = 1600g.
* **Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:** Joe has 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40g, so the total weight is 25 * 40 = 1000g.
* **Calculate the total weight of the bag:** The total weight of the bag is 1600g + 1000g = 2600g.

"Okay, so we know half a dozen plates costs $36000.  To find out how much twenty dozen cups cost, we need to figure out the difference.  

The difference is $1200.  So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Now, we need to figure out how much one cup costs.  We know there are 240 cups in twenty dozen.  So, the cost per cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.

"Here's how to figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn:

* **Calculate her total earnings:** She needs $70 for the jacket and shoes, and she has $10 saved.  She needs to make $70 - $10 = $60 more.
* **Figure out how many mowings:** She earns $24 per lawn mowing, so she needs to mow $60 / $24 = 2.5 times. 

Since she can't mow half a lawn, Sara needs to mow the lawn **3 times** to afford the jacket and shoes.

"Let's break this down!

* **Let's use variables:**  Let 'r' be the number of red chickens and 'w' be the number of white chickens.

* **We know:**
    *  The total number of chickens is r + w 
    *  Red chickens lay 3 eggs a day and white chickens lay 5 eggs a day, and Jerry collects 42 eggs in total.

* **Let's set up an equation:**
    * 3r + 5w = 42 
    * r = w + 2 (This tells us there are two more white chickens than red chickens)

* **Solve for 'r':**
    * We can use the second equation to substitute 'r' in the first equation: 
       3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
    * Simplify and solve for 'w':
       3w + 6 + 5w = 42
       8w + 6 = 42
       8w = 36
       w = 4.5 
    *  We can't have half a chicken, so there's probably a mistake in the problem. 


**Answer:** There's no solution to this problem as it's written.

"To find out how long Gary walks, we need to figure out how long it takes him to cover the whole perimeter of the park. 

The park is a rectangle, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 
Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

We know the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Let's plug those in:
Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk the whole perimeter, we divide the distance by his speed:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

So, Gary spends **5 hours** walking.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day.
* The next day she counted 50 more than the first day, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
*  She counted a total of 250 customers in the first two days.
*  To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the total from the first two days from the total number of customers she counted in three days: 500 - 250 = 250.

"
"Let's break this down step by step:

* **Let's use variables:**
   *  Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool.
   *  The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
   *  Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
   *  The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   *  The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
   *  The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

* **Solve for x:**
   *  8x = 4(x - 16)
   *  8x = 4x - 64
   *  4x = -64
   *  x = -16

* **The answer is not possible:**  We get a negative value for x, which means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way.


**Final answer:** There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and wants to pay it back with an extra 10% on top.  That means she'll pay back $2000 + (10/100)* $2000 = $2000 + $200 = $2200.  She's paying $165 a month for 12 months, so she'll pay $165 * 12 = $1980.  So, her total payment will be $1980.  To find out how much she'll owe, we need to subtract her total payment from the total amount she borrowed.  That means she'll have $2200 - $1980 = $220 left.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Harriet is 21 years old.
* Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* Zack is half Harriet's age, so Zack is 21 / 2 = 10.5 years old.

To find the average age in three years, we need to consider their ages in three years. 

* In three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
* Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
* Zack will be 10.5 + 3 = 13.5 years old.

Now, to find the average, we add their ages and divide by 3: (24 + 66 + 13.5) / 3 = 103.5 / 3 = 34.5 years.

* **Brianna's points:** Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
* **Total points:**  The total score for all four students is 251.  We know Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna's scores, so we can find Jojo's score: 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 104 points.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1:  First harvest**
   - 30% of the watermelons were ready, so Ashlyn took 30% of 120, which is 36 watermelons.

* **Step 2:  Watermelons left after the first harvest**
   -  Ashlyn had 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.

"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars for his company. Each car costs $20,000.  He has to pay 10% tax on the cars, and then another $1000 for registration on each car.  How much does he pay in total?

Here's how to figure it out:

* **Cost of the cars:** 12 cars * $20,000/car = $240,000
* **Tax:** $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000
* **Total cost before registration:** $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000
* **Total cost including registration:** $264,000 + ($1000/car * 12 cars) = $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

So, Mark pays $276,000 in total.

"Let's break this down!

* We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another.
* The difference between the snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. 
* We need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium.

Let's use some simple math:

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Start with the total cards:** Carly has 80 cards.
* **Cards with A:**  Two-fifths of the cards have the letter A, so that's (2/5) * 80 = 32 cards.
* **Cards left after A:**  She has 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.
* **Cards with B:** One-half of the remaining cards have the letter B, so that's (1/2) * 48 = 24 cards.
* **Cards left after B:**  She has 48 - 24 = 24 cards left.
* **Cards with C:**  Five-eighths of the remaining cards have the letter C, so that's (5/8) * 24 = 15 cards.
* **Cards left after C:** She has 24 - 15 = 9 cards left.

**Answer:** 9 cards.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Small holes:**  Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig each small hole, and he's making 30 of them, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.
* **Large holes:**  He takes 10 minutes to dig each large hole, and he's making 15 of them, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.
* **Total time:**  To find the total time, we add the time for the small holes and the time for the large holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.
* **Convert to hours:**  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

**Answer:** It will take Matthew 4 hours.

"Here's how to solve this:

* **Let's think about their ages:**  Let's say Mico is 'm' years old, and Marco is also 'm' years old.

* **The sum of their ages is 20:**  So, m + m = 20

* **Solve for their ages:**  This means 2m = 20.  Divide both sides by 2 to get m = 10.

* **Their ages in 10 years:**  In 10 years, Mico will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old, and Marco will also be 10 + 10 = 20 years old.

* **The sum of their ages in 10 years:**  Their ages will be 20 + 20 = 40 years old.

"Let's break this down:

*  Let Ruby's current age be ""R""
*  Let Sam's current age be ""S""

We know:

* R = 6S (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
* R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now we can solve for S (Sam's current age):

1.  We can use the first equation to substitute for R in the second equation: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
2.  Simplify and solve for S: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3.  Subtract 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27
4.  Subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18
5.  Divide both sides by 3: S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

"Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, and 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.  To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars. 

* Popsicles: 20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00
* Ice cream bars: 4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00
* Total cost: $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find the number of spots on a mamba:**  The problem tells us a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba. So, a mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots.
* **Find the total number of spots:**  We know there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas.  To find the total number of spots, we multiply the number of cobras by their spots and the number of mambas by their spots: 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots and 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots.
* **Find the total number of spots:**  The total number of spots is 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.
* **Find half the total number of spots:**  Half of the total number of spots is 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

"To find out how many silver beads Katerina uses, we need to figure out how much space the silver beads take up.  

*  She uses 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, for a total of 8 inches.
*  The necklace is 25 inches long, so there's 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches left for the silver beads.
*  Each silver bead is 0.25 inches long, so we divide the space for the beads by their length: 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.

**Answer:** Katerina uses 68 silver beads per necklace.

* 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 5,000 pounds total weight
* 5,000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks 
 
Since you can't have half a truck, you'll need 3 trucks.

"Okay, so we know the fast lane car is going 60 miles per hour.  The slow lane car is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.  We want to find out how long it took the slow lane car to travel 480 miles.

We can use the formula: distance = speed * time.

Let's plug in what we know: 480 miles = 30 miles per hour * time.

To find the time, we need to divide both sides by 30 miles per hour: 

time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours.

So, the slow lane car took **16 hours** to travel the same distance.

"So, John drives 30 miles each way to work, 5 days a week, for 50 weeks a year.  That's a lot of driving!  He pays $2 per mile, and he also gives his driver a $150 bonus each month.  To figure out how much he pays in total, we need to do a few things.

First, we need to figure out how many miles he drives each year.  He drives 30 miles each way, so that's 60 miles a day.  He does this 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week.  Over the whole year, that's 300 miles/week * 52 weeks/year = 15,600 miles.

Now, we need to figure out how much he pays for the driving.  He pays $2 per mile, so he pays 15,600 miles * $2/mile = $31,200.

Finally, he gets a $150 bonus each month, so he gets $150 * 12 months = $1,800.  

So, in total, he pays $31,200 for the driving and $1,800 in bonuses.

"Peter wants to exercise for twice the time he did on Sunday and Monday combined.  On Sunday he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday he exercised for 16 minutes.  To find out how long he needs to exercise on Tuesday, we need to figure out how much time that is.  

* **Total time on Sunday and Monday:** 23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes
* **Twice the combined time:** 39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday. 


**Answer:** 78

"Annika started with $50. She spent half of that on food and snacks, which was $25. Then she spent another $10 on rides.  To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the total spent from her starting amount: $50 - $25 - $10 = $15.  So, Annika has $15 left. 


**Answer:** $15

"Elise sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books this year, for a total of 135 books sold in the first two years.  She sold 200 books in the third year.  To find out how much money she earned, we need to multiply the number of books sold by the price per book.  

Here's how to calculate her earnings:

* **First two years earnings:** 135 books * $20/book = $2700
* **Third year earnings:** 200 books * $20/book = $4000
* **Total earnings:** $2700 + $4000 = $6700


**Answer:** $6700

"Okay, so Watson works 10 hours a day, five days a week. That's 10 * 5 = 50 hours a week.  He makes $10 an hour, so he makes 50 * 10 = $500 a week.  And, if the company does well, he gets a $300 bonus.  So, he makes $500 + $300 = $800 a week.  That's how much he makes in April!

"Okay, so we need to figure out how much we'll save.  

First, we know the ice cream is $11 now, and it was $13 before.  That means we save $2 per tub.  So, for 2 tubs, we save $2 * 2 = $4.

We also need to know the price of the milk to figure out how much we'll save on that.  

Let me know the price of the milk, and I can help you calculate the total savings!

"Okay, so Theo has $6000 for his trip. He buys suits, suitcases, and a flight.  He wants to save $2000.  Let's figure out how much he has left for gifts.

* **Suits:** 6 suits * $100/suit = $600
* **Suitcases:** 3 suitcases * $50/suit = $150
* **Flight:**  5 * $100 = $500, and then $700 more, so $500 + $700 = $1200
* **Total spent:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350
* **Money left:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650
* **Gifts:** $3650 - $2000 = $1650

"Let's break this down:

* Cera is 46 years old now.
* Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, so he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, which is 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
*  Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 + 6 = 60,006.

"Let's break this down:

* We know the total number of players is 105.
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so let's call the number of defense players ""x"".
* The special teams have half as many players as the defense, so they have x/2 players.

Now we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + (x/2) = 105

Let's simplify:

(7/2)x = 105

To find x, we can multiply both sides by 2/7:

x = 105 * (2/7)

x = 30

**Answer:** There are 30 players on the defense.

"Here's how to solve this:

We know that 5 people traded their old records for new ones.  They traded 7 new records in total.  Since each person traded 2 old records for 1 new record, we can figure out how many old records they brought in. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Let's say each person brought x old records.**
* **They traded 2x old records for 1 new record.**
* **The total number of old records they brought in is 5x.**
* **The total number of new records they got is 5.**

We know that 5 people traded their records, and they got 7 new records.  So, we can set up an equation:

5x = 7

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 5:

x = 7 / 5 = 1.4

This answer doesn't make sense because you can't have half a record.

"Okay, so we know there are 100 people working at the company.  Junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total, which is 40 people.  They each get paid $2000 a month.  Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2400 a month.  

To find the total salary for all programmers, we need to figure out how much the junior programmers make and how much the senior programmers make.  

The total salary for the junior programmers is 40 people * $2000/person = $80,000.

The total salary for the senior programmers is 60 people * $2400/person = $144,000.

Finally, the total salary for all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"To figure this out, we need to think about how much charge the phone gains per minute.  It gains 1% of charge every 3 minutes.

We want to know how long it takes to get to 100%, which means we need to figure out how many minutes it takes to gain 40% of charge (since it's currently at 60%).

So, we need to figure out how many minutes it takes to gain 40% of charge.  

* 40% of charge is the same as 0.40.
* We know it gains 1% every 3 minutes, so we can figure out how many 3-minute intervals it takes to gain 0.40. 
* 0.40 / 0.01 = 40. 
* 40 minutes is equal to 40 / 3 = 13.33 minutes.

"So, let's figure out which job pays more.

**Job A:**

* This job pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, which is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
* The state taxes that money at 20%, so they take $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
* After taxes, Nick gets $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

**Job B:**

* This job pays $42,000 a year.
* The state charges $6,000 in property taxes.
* After that, they have a 10% tax on the rest of the money, which is $36,000 - $6,000 = $30,000.
* The 10% tax on that is $30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000.
* Nick gets $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

**The difference:**

* Job B pays $27,000 - $24,000 = $3,000 more than Job A.


**Answer:** Job B pays more.

"Okay, so Maria buys 8 shares of stock for $8 each.  The stock goes up 50% the first year, then goes down 25% the second year.  

To figure out the final value, we need to do a little math. 

* **First year:** The stock goes up by 50% of $8, which is $8 * 0.50 = $4.  So the stock is now worth $8 + $4 = $12.
* **Second year:** The stock goes down 25% of $12, which is $12 * 0.25 = $3. So the stock is now worth $12 - $3 = $9.

**Answer:** The final value of all of Maria's shares is $9.

"Here's how to figure out the answer:

* Thomas ate 3 times more hot dogs than Luke, who ate 2. So Thomas ate 3 * 2 = 6 hot dogs.
* John ate half the amount Thomas ate, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.
* To find the difference, we subtract Luke's hot dogs from John's: 3 - 2 = 1.

**Answer:** John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Let's think about the groups:** The class is split into 3 groups.  
* **The equal groups:**  We know there are 2 equal groups.
* **The smaller group:** The last group is 10 less than each of the other groups.
* **Total students:**  The total number of students is 200.

**Let's figure out how many students are in the smaller group:**

* **Let's use variables:** Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.
* **The smaller group:** The smaller group has x - 10 students.
* **Total students in the equal groups:** 2 groups * x = 2x students
* **Total students in the class:** 2x + (x - 10) = 200

**Solve for x:** 
* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

**The smaller group has:** 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let's use variables to represent the number of chickens and cows:

* Let 'c' be the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' be the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 60 (The total number of animals is 60)
*  c = 2w (There are twice as many chickens as cows)

Now we can solve for the number of chickens and cows:

1.  We can use the second equation to substitute 'c' in the first equation: 2w + w = 60
2.  Combine the 'w' terms: 3w = 60
3.  Solve for 'w' by dividing both sides by 3: w = 20
4.  Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can use it to find 'c': c = 2 * 20 = 40

Finally, let's calculate the total number of legs:

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so there are 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so there are 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.
* The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters each day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, which is like adding 1/5 of 5000 meters.  That's 5000/5 = 1000 meters extra.  So now he's running 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters each day.  To figure out how far he runs in a month, we just multiply his daily distance by the number of days in a month.  That's 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.

"Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, and Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A.  To find the difference between Juice Box C and Juice Box B, we need to find the price of Juice Box B first.

Juice Box C costs $11, and Juice Box B costs $9, so the difference is $11 - $9 = $2.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Figure out how much money Billy had left after buying candy:**  He had $10.00 and spent $1.50 on candy, so he has $10.00 - $1.50 = $8.50 left.
* **Figure out how much money Billy spent on gumballs:** He spent $0.20 on gumballs.
* **Calculate how much money Billy had left after buying gumballs:** He had $8.50 and spent $0.20 on gumballs, so he has $8.50 - $0.20 = $8.30 left.
* **Figure out how many pounds of candy Billy bought:**  He spent $8.30 on candy, and each pound of candy costs $1.50, so he bought $8.30 / $1.50 = 5.53 pounds of candy. 

**Answer:** Billy bought approximately 5.53 pounds of candy.

"Let's think about this problem. Carver is 45 years old, and we know he's 5 years less than twice his son's age.  

To figure out his son's age, let's use a simple equation:

* Let 's' represent the son's age.
* Twice Carver's age is 2 * 45 = 90 years.
* Five years less than twice Carver's age is 90 - 5 = 85 years.

Since Carver is 85 years old, his son must be 85 - 5 = 80 years old.


**Answer: 80**

"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles from city 1 to city 2, then 100 miles from city 2 to city 3, and then 50 miles less than that to get from city 3 to city 1.  That's a total of 225 miles for one trip.  The train does this trip 3 times a day.  To figure out how many days it takes for the train to need a service, we need to know how many miles it travels in total.  The train travels 675 miles in a day.  The train needs a service every 18,000 miles.  So, we divide the total miles traveled by the service interval.  That gives us 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.  Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train needs a service every **27 days**.

"Okay, so John drives 200 miles to his friend's house, then takes a detour that adds 10 miles to the trip.  He then drives home on a different route that's 240 miles long.  

To figure out how long the whole trip takes, we need to figure out how long it takes to get to his friend's house, how long the detour takes, and how long it takes to get home.

* **To get to his friend's house:** 
   * He drives at 70 mph, so it takes him 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours.
* **The detour adds 10 miles:**
   * He's driving at 70 mph, so it takes him 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours.
* **To get home:**
   * He drives at 80 mph, so it takes him 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

Now, let's add up the time for each part of the trip: 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours. 

**Answer:** 6.00 hours

"The wallpaper costs $400 at the market.  If Ethan makes it himself, he saves 20% of the cost.  To find out how much he'll spend, we need to figure out how much he saves.  20% of $400 is (20/100) * $400 = $80.  Then, we subtract that from the original price to find the final cost.  So, the total cost of making the wallpaper himself is $400 - $80 = $320.

"Let's think about this problem step-by-step.

*  We know Mr. Ruther sold some of his land, and he's left with 12.8 hectares. 
*  We can figure out how much land he had originally by using the fact that he has 12.8 hectares left after selling some.
*  Let's say he had 'x' hectares of land at first.
*  He sold 3/5 of his land, which is (3/5)x hectares.
*  The amount of land he has left is (1 - 3/5)x, which is 2/5 * x.
*  We know that (2/5)x = 12.8 hectares. 
*  To find x, we can solve for it:
    * Multiply both sides by 5/2: x = 12.8 * (5/2)
    * Calculate: x = 32 hectares.

**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Okay, so Tyson wants to make muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people.  He needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese per sandwich, and each sandwich serves 4 people.  

First, we need to figure out how many sandwiches he needs to make.  20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches.

Now, he'll need 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat.

And he'll need 5 sandwiches * 1 pound per sandwich = 5 pounds of cheese.

The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so he'll spend 5 pounds * $7.00 per pound = $35.00 on meat.

The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so he'll spend 5 pounds * $3.00 per pound = $15.00 on cheese.

Finally, he'll spend a total of $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00 on the meat and cheese.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Joanne's apples from shortest trees:** Joanne gathers half the apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  She gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister, and we know her sister gathers 3 times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne.
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from tallest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:** Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples.

"Let's break this down!

We know there are 180 heads in total, and we need to figure out how many of those are camels and how many are dromedaries. 

* **Heads:**  We know camels and dromedaries are mixed in the herd, so we can represent the total number of heads as a sum of the number of camels and dromedaries.
* **Bumps:**  Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one.  We know there are 304 bumps in total.

Let's use variables to make things easier:

* Let 'c' be the number of camels.
* Let 'd' be the number of dromedaries.

We can set up two equations based on the information given:

1. **c + d = 180** (The total number of heads)
2. **2c + d = 304** (The total number of bumps)

Now we can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve the first equation for 'c':

* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:

* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

**Answer:** There are 56 dromedaries.

"Okay, so Antoine wants to make a big batch of French onion soup.  He needs twice the amount of onions, which is 4 pounds.  He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which is $2.00 per box.  

To figure out the cost per serving, we need to find the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings. 

The total cost is $8.00 for the onions and $4.00 for the beef stock, for a total of $12.00.  

The soup will serve 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 = $2.00.

"Here's how to find the perimeter:

* **Know the formula:** The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding up the lengths of all its sides.  It's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.
* **Find the length:** The length is given as 3 yards, which is equal to 9 feet.
* **Find the width:** The area of the rectangle is 360 square feet, and we know length * width = area. So, width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet.
* **Calculate the perimeter:**  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.

**Answer:** 98 feet

"Here's how to figure out the final temperature:

1. **Oven heating:** The oven is on for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.  The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, so it adds 5 degrees/hour * 180 minutes = 900 degrees.

2. **Cooling:** Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, which is 30/10 = 3 degrees.

3. **Final temperature:**  The house starts at 40 degrees and gets 900 degrees hotter from the oven. Then it cools down 3 degrees because of the window.  The final temperature is 40 + 900 - 3 = 937 degrees.

"Okay, so Jon finishes the triathlon in 160 minutes.  James is 10% faster in the swim, so he finishes that part in 40 * 1.10 = 44 minutes.  James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so he takes 70 + 5 = 75 minutes.

To find out how long James takes to run, we need to figure out how much time he takes compared to Jon.  Jon takes 160 minutes, and James wins by 10 minutes, so James takes 160 - 10 = 150 minutes. 

James takes 150 minutes to run.

"To find the average speed, we need to figure out the total distance traveled and the total time it took. 

* **Distance:** The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, covering 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it drives 30 mph for 1 hour, covering 30 * 1 = 30 miles.  The total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.
* **Time:** The trip takes 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.
* **Average Speed:**  The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

So the answer is 50 mph.

"Okay, so Bob has 10 raised beds, each 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall.  That means each bed needs 32 cubic feet of soil.  He needs to buy enough soil for all 10 beds, so that's 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet total.  Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags of soil.  Finally, 160 bags cost $12 each, so the total cost is 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

* **Total red and green cards:**  We know there are 15 red cards and 9 green cards, so there are a total of 15 + 9 = 24 cards.
* **Yellow cards:**  The problem says yellow cards are the same as the sum of red and green cards, so there are also 24 yellow cards.
* **Total cards:**  To find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards: 15 + 9 + 24 = 48 cards.

"Okay, so the farmer needs to buy hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes for his horses.  Let's figure out how many trips he'll need to make to get all the feed.

* **Hay:** He buys 42 bales of hay, and each bale weighs 75 pounds, so that's 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.
* **Oats:** He buys 20 sacks of oats, and each sack weighs 65 pounds, so that's 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.
* **Sugar cubes:** He buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, and each box is 1 pound, so that's 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.
* **Carrots:** He buys 4 bags of carrots, and each bag weighs 12 pounds, so that's 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weight: 3150 + 1300 + 2 + 48 = 4500 pounds.

Finally, we need to figure out how many trips the truck can carry. The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.  So, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

**Answer:** The farmer needs to make 2 trips.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1:**  Figure out how many pencils were used.  Since 1/5 of the pencils were used, we know 1/5 * 30 pencils = 6 pencils were used.

* **Step 2:**  Calculate how many pencils were left after the first two months.  We start with 30 pencils and subtract the used pencils: 30 pencils - 6 pencils = 24 pencils.

* **Step 3:**  Calculate how many pencils were left after the end of the year. We know 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, so we do 1/3 * 24 pencils = 8 pencils.

"Let's break this down:

* Matt wants to eat 5 cookies.
* His dad says he can have half the number of carrot sticks he eats plus 2 extra for cleaning his room.

This means we need to figure out how many carrot sticks he needs to eat to get 5 cookies.

Let's use a variable to represent the number of carrot sticks:

* Let 'x' be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

We know that:

*  0.5x + 2 = 5 

Now we can solve for 'x':

* Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
* Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

**Answer:** Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Think about the problem:** We know that 3/4 of the students have a desktop computer.  We also know that 20 students don't have one.  
* **Let's use variables:** Let 'x' represent the total number of students.
* **Set up an equation:** We can use the information given to create an equation.  Since 3/4 of the students have computers, we know that (3/4)x represents the number of students with computers.  The number of students without computers is represented by (1/4)x. We know that 20 students don't have computers, so we can write the equation: (3/4)x - 20 = (1/4)x
* **Solve for x:**  
    * Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: 3x - 80 = x
    * Subtract x from both sides: 2x - 80 = 0
    * Add 80 to both sides: 2x = 80
    * Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

**Answer:** There are 40 students at that grade level.

"Let's break this down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72

"Okay, so Frederick wants to make popsicles and save money, so he's making his own popsicle sticks.  He's got a budget of $24 to buy wood.  He can get 200 sticks from a 2x4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2x8 piece. 

To figure out how many sticks he can make, we need to figure out which wood is cheaper per stick. 

* **2x4:**  $4 for 200 sticks. That means each stick costs $0.02.
* **2x8:** $6 for 400 sticks. That means each stick costs $0.015.

The 2x4 is cheaper, so we'll use that to make the most popsicles.

He can buy 6 pieces of 2x4 wood with $24.  That means he can make 6 * 200 = 1200 popsicle sticks.

"Let's think about this like a simple equation.  We know the house and the lot cost a total of $120,000.  The house costs three times as much as the lot.  So, we can figure out how much the lot costs and then multiply it by 3 to find the price of the house. 

The lot costs $x.  The house costs 3 times the lot, so it costs 3x.  

The total cost of the house and lot is $120,000.  So, we can write the equation: x + 3x = $120,000.

Combining like terms, we get 4x = $120,000.  To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 4: x = $30,000.

The house costs 3 times the lot, so it costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

"Okay, so Ada's daily electric use is 12 kilowatts.  She's adding a new device that uses 2 kilowatts a day.  

To figure out her weekly bill, we need to know how much she'll use each week.  Her new daily use is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts.  

Now, let's think about how much she'll use in a week.  That's 14 kilowatts per day * 7 days a week = 98 kilowatts.

Her weekly bill before the new device is 98 kilowatts * $1.50 per kilowatt = $147.00.

"Okay, so the food truck sells grilled cheese sandwiches.  They have to buy bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They also spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches.  They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.  How much money do they make?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Cost of bread:** They need $3.00 for each loaf of bread, and they make 10 sandwiches per loaf. So, it costs $3.00 / 10 = $0.30 per sandwich for the bread.
* **Cost of cheese and condiments:** They spend $30.00 for 10 sandwiches, so it costs $30.00 / 10 = $3.00 per sandwich for the cheese and condiments.
* **Total cost:**  The total cost for the sandwiches is $0.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $3.00
* **Total revenue:** They sell each sandwich for $7.00, and they sell 10 sandwiches, so they make $7.00 * 10 = $70.00
* **Net profit:**  Their net profit is their total revenue minus their total cost. So, they make $70.00 - $3.00 = $67.00

"Okay, so Michael's getting new carpet for his bedroom.  Here's how to figure out the total cost:

* **Carpet:**  He needs 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet of carpet.
   * The carpet costs $12 per square foot, so that's 216 * $12 = $2592
* **Padding:** He's also getting padding, which costs $2 per square foot, so that's 216 * $2 = $432
* **Removal:** The contractor charges $4 per square foot to take out the old carpet, so that's 216 * $4 = $864
* **Installation:** The installer charges $34 per square foot, so that's 216 * $34 = $7456
* **Total:**  To find the total cost, we add all those up: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7456 = $11344

**So the total cost to replace the carpet is $11344.**

"Let's break this down!

The note says the jar has 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.  

Let's use 'b' to represent the number of blue jelly beans.  

*  We know there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so there are 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans.
*  We also know there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so there are 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of all three: b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Let's simplify the equation: 2.99b = 4500

Now, divide both sides by 2.99 to find the number of blue jelly beans: b = 1500

To find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we can use the information about the percentages:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

The jar has 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

* **Dachshund:** Twice the weight of the Affenpinscher, so 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds
* **Papillon:**  One-fourth the weight of the Dachshund, so 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds
* **Mastiff:** 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds

**Answer:** 220 pounds

"The boots cost $16 on Amazon and $13 on eBay.  The shipping on eBay is twice as much as on Amazon, so it costs $8.  The total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.  The boots are $21 - $16 = $5 more expensive on eBay. 

**Answer:** $5 
"
"Here's how to figure this out:

The beanstalk doubles in height each day.  We need to find the day when it reaches 20 feet. 

* Day 1: 4 feet
* Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
* Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet
* Day 4: 16 * 2 = 32 feet
* Day 5: 32 * 2 = 64 feet
* Day 6: 64 * 2 = 128 feet
* Day 7: 128 * 2 = 256 feet

It will take **7 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

"Okay, so he eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day.  Each cup has 3 grams of protein.  To find out how much protein he gets in a day, we multiply the grams of mushrooms by the protein per cup.  So, 200 grams * 3 grams/cup = 600 grams of protein.  To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.  So, 600 grams/day * 7 days/week = 4200 grams of protein. 


**Answer:** 4200

"Let's think about this problem.  We know Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  That means we need to figure out how old he is now and then add three to that. 

Let's say Jerry's current age is represented by the variable ""x"".  Five years ago, he was x - 5 years old.  We know that he's twice as old now as he was five years ago, so we can write an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Now we can solve for x:

x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. In three years, he'll be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"Okay, so George needs to pay for two implants, and each one costs $2000.  He also wants a crown for one of them, which costs an extra $500.  That means the total cost of the implants is $2000 + $500 = $2500.  He's already paid a deposit of $600, so he still needs to pay $2500 - $600 = $1900.  He makes $15 per hour, so to make $1900, he needs to work $1900 / $15 per hour = 126.67 hours.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!  

We know that the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  

Let's say the smallest angle is 'x'.  The other two angles are:

* Twice the smallest: 2x
* Three times the smallest: 3x

So, we can write an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get: 6x = 180

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now, the largest angle is three times the smallest, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"The pet store has 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds.  

* Dogs have 4 legs each, so there are 5 * 4 = 20 dog legs.
* Cats have 4 legs each, so there are 2 * 4 = 8 cat legs.
* Birds have 2 legs each, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 bird legs.

In total, there are 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs. 


**Answer:** 48

"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases it by 50%, so it becomes 8 pounds + (50/100) * 8 pounds = 12 pounds.  Since it's too heavy, he uses a weight that's 2 pounds lighter, so he uses 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds. 

**Answer:** 10

"To figure this out, we need to know how long it takes the plane to travel a certain distance at a certain speed. 

* **Step 1: Find the plane's speed.**  We know it travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

* **Step 2:  Calculate the time to travel 2000 miles.**  We want to know how long it takes to travel 2000 miles at the same speed. So, we divide the distance by the speed: 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

**Answer:** It would take **5 hours** to travel an additional 2000 miles.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Ruiz's production:** Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.  To find out how much he makes in one hour, we divide: 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.
* **Marissa's production:** Marissa makes 3/4 times as much as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour.
* **Total production:**  They work for 12 hours, so Ruiz makes 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa makes 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.
* **Total:**  Their combined production is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"Okay, so Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  That's a lot of miles!  To figure out how long his tires will last, we need to figure out how many times they rotate.  

* Each tire rotates 725 times every 2 miles.
* He drives 400 miles, so we need to figure out how many times the tires rotate. 
* That's 400 miles / 2 miles per rotation = 200 rotations.
* Now we need to figure out how many rotations are in a year. 
* There are 12 months in a year, so that's 200 rotations/month * 12 months = 2400 rotations.
* We know each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations.
* To figure out how many years it will take for the tires to wear out, we divide the total rotations by the rotations per tire. 
* That's 10,440,000 rotations / 2400 rotations = 43.7 years.


**Answer:** 43.7 years

"Okay, so Joe has $50 to spend on a new outfit for his field trip.  There's a 30% off sale, so he'll save some money!  The shirt is $25, and the shorts are $35.  Let's figure out how much he'll have left after the sale.

First, the shirt is $25, and he gets 30% off, so he pays $25 - $7.50 = $17.50 for the shirt.  Then, the shorts cost $35.  So, the total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.  

Now, we need to figure out how much he'll pay after the sale.  Let's say the sales tax is 6%.  That means he'll pay an extra $52.50 * 0.06 = $3.15 in sales tax.  So, the final price is $52.50 + $3.15 = $55.65. 

**Answer:** $55.65

"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to find the difference in cost between the two streets. 

* Monica's street is 150 meters long and costs $194 per meter to repave, so it costs $194 * 150 = $29,100.
* Lewis' street is 490 meters long and costs $194 per meter, so it costs $194 * 490 = $95,660.
* The difference in cost is $95,660 - $29,100 = $66,560. 

So the answer is **$66,560**.

"To figure this out, we need to know how much meat Prince can sell in a day. He sells 15 kg of meat per hour and works 10 hours a day, so he sells 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg of meat per day.

Then, we need to divide the bull's weight (750 kg) by the amount of meat Prince sells per day (150 kg).  750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days.

So it will take Prince **5 days** to sell the meat from the bull.

"Manny can miss **10** classes. 

Here's why:

* If the total cost is more than $10 per class, his parents won't pay.
* He has 10 classes total. 
* To figure out how many he can miss, we divide the total cost by the price per class. 
* $100 / $10/class = 10 classes

"Okay, so Jewel processes 50 customers a day. Julie is twice as fast, so she processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers a day.  

To find their total weekly production, we need to multiply their daily numbers by the number of days in a week:

* Julie: 100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers
* Jewel: 50 customers/day * 7 days/week = 350 customers

Finally, add their weekly production: 700 + 350 = 1050 customers

**Answer:** 1050

"Lynn ran 17 miles. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* Paisley ran 4 miles.
* Reggie ran 5 times Paisley's distance, which is 5 * 4 = 20 miles.
* Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.

"Here's how to figure that out:

* **Apples:**  Four apples cost $5.20, so one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.
* **Oranges:** Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.
* **Total cost:** Five apples cost $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.
* **Total cost:** Five oranges cost $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.
* **Total:**  $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00

So Clyde will pay $12.00.

"To figure out how long it takes Bob to dig the hole, we need to know how long it takes him to shovel one cubic foot of dirt.  

* **Volume:** The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, so the volume is 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet.

* **Time:**  Since it takes him 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot, it will take him 72 / 3 = 24 seconds to dig the whole hole. 


**Answer:** 24 seconds

"The truck costs $30,000 to start.  Then, there are extra things you can get for it.  The king cab is $7,500, leather seats are a third of that, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.  Running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.  The upgraded light package is $1,500.  So, the total cost of all the extras is $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500.  The total cost of the truck is $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500.

"Okay, so Tim gets a raise of 5% of his $20,000 a month salary.  That's like adding 5% of 20,000 to his salary.  Then, he gets a bonus that's half his salary.  To figure out his total yearly earnings, we need to add up his new salary and his bonus. 

**Here's how to do it:**

* **Raise:**  $20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000
* **New Salary:** $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

"Okay, so Clara bought 20 pomegranates on Tuesday for $20 each, and got a $2 discount, so they cost her $400 total.  Then the price went up to $30 a fruit the next day.  She bought 20 more pomegranates, and they were on sale for a 10% discount.  

To find the final price, we need to figure out the total cost of the pomegranates on the second day.  The price per pomegranate is $30, and she bought 20, so that's $30 * 20 = $600.  Then, she got a 10% discount, so the final price is $600 - $60 = $540.

The difference in price between the two days is $540 - $360 = $180.

"Okay, so James bought a plane for $150,000.  He has to pay $5000 a month to keep it in a hangar.  He also spends twice as much on fuel each month as that.  To figure out how much it costs him to own the plane for a year, we need to figure out his monthly costs and then multiply that by 12. 

* **Fuel cost:** He spends twice as much on fuel as his hangar rent, so he spends $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.
* **Total monthly cost:** His total monthly cost is $5000 (hangar) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000
* **Yearly cost:**  His yearly cost is $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000

So, it cost him $180,000 to own the plane for a year.

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep and geese:
    *  Let 's' be the number of sheep.
    *  Let 'g' be the number of geese.

* We know the total number of legs is 70: 
    * Sheep have 4 legs, so 4s legs.
    * Geese have 2 legs, so 2g legs.
    *  This gives us the equation: 4s + 2g = 70

* We also know the total number of heads is 20:
    *  Sheep have 1 head.
    *  Geese have 1 head.
    *  This gives us the equation: s + g = 20

* Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

   *  Let's solve the second equation for 'g':  g = 20 - s
   *  Substitute this value of 'g' into the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
   *  Simplify and solve for 's': 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

"Okay, so we know 60% of the teachers are history teachers, which is 90.  The rest are math teachers, so there are 60 teachers who are math teachers.  Each of those math teachers sleeps for 6 hours a day.  To find the total sleep time, we just multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep.  That's 60 teachers * 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours. 


**Answer:** 360

"Let's break this down:

* **Aurelia has $120.**
* **Kassidy has 3/4 of Aurelia's money, so Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.**
* **Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150.**
* **To find out how much they would have if they shared equally, we add their money and divide by 3:** $150 + $90 + $120 = $360.
* **Finally, we divide the total by 3 to find out how much each person gets:** $360 / 3 = $120.

"Let's break this down.  We know Janey has 3 more books than twice the number Sally has.  We also know Janey has 21 books.  

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of books Sally has.  Twice the number of books Sally has is 2x.  

We can set up an equation: 2x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books. 


**Answer: 9**

"Here's how to figure out how many toys James needs:

* **Start:** James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he has 4 toys * 4 dogs = 16 toys.
* **New dogs:** There are 8 more dogs, so there are 4 dogs + 8 dogs = 12 dogs in the shelter.
* **Twice as many dogs:** There are twice as many dogs as when he left, so there are 12 dogs * 2 = 24 dogs.
* **Toys needed:** James needs toys for 24 dogs, so he needs 24 dogs * 1 toy/dog = 24 toys.
* **Toys bought:** James bought 24 toys - 16 toys = 8 more toys.

"To figure this out, we need to figure out how many hash browns you can make with a certain number of potatoes.  We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.  So, to find out how many hash browns you can make with 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion. 

Here's how:

* **Let 'x' be the number of hash browns you can make with 96 potatoes.**
* **Set up the proportion:**  We know 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, so we can write: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns
* **Solve for x:**  Cross-multiply and solve for x: 
   * 6 * x = 36 * 96
   * 6x = 3456
   * x = 3456 / 6
   * x = 576

**Answer:** You can make 576 hash browns with 96 potatoes.

"Let's break this down:

* Shania extended the dress by 50% of its original length, which means she added 0.50 times the original length.
* She also added 20cm of lace trim.
* The final dress is 140cm long.

Let's use algebra to figure out the original length:

* Let 'x' be the original length of the dress.
* The extended dress is 1.50x (because she extended it by 50%).
* We know the final dress is 140cm long, so: 1.50x + 20 = 140

Now we can solve for x:

* Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.50x = 120
* Divide both sides by 1.50: x = 80

**Therefore, the dress was 80cm long in its original design.**

* The triplet's age is '3t' (since there are three of them).
* The problem tells us the twin is 7 years older than the triplet. 
* Their combined ages are 44.

So, we can set up an equation: t + 3t = 44

Now, let's solve for 't':

* 4t = 44
* t = 44 / 4
* t = 11

Therefore, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"Here's how to figure out how many coins they'll have in ten years:

* **Rong's savings:** Rong saves 20 coins each month, so in a year he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins. Over ten years, he'll save 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
* **Neil's savings:** Neil saves 2/5 more than Rong, so he saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 28 coins each month. Over ten years, he'll save 28 * 12 * 10 = 3360 coins.
* **Total savings:**  Rong's savings + Neil's savings = 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Okay, so we need to figure out the price of the fruit crate. 

* **Bananas:** They cost twice as much as apples, which cost $0.50 each. So, bananas cost $0.50 * 2 = $1.00 each.
* **Oranges:** They cost three times as much as bananas, which cost $1.00. So, oranges cost $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each.

Now, let's add up the cost of each fruit:

* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Finally, add all the costs together: $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00

**So, the crate of fruit costs $32.00.**

"Here's how to figure out the total ice cream made:

* **Chocolate:** The factory makes 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream every 2 hours.  
* **Vanilla:** They make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream every 4 hours.

To find the total quarts made in 48 hours, we need to figure out how many 2-hour and 4-hour chunks of time we have.

"Ron is in a tough spot!  He's got a pothole that's going to cost his car $450 to fix, but the city won't fix it.  He'd have to pay a $120 fine if he fixes it himself.  He also has to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.  

To figure out if fixing the pothole is a good idea, let's look at the costs:

* **Asphalt:** 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75
* **Total cost to fix the pothole:** $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195

So, if he fixes the pothole, he'll spend $195.  But if he doesn't fix it, the pothole will cause $450 in damage.

"Let's break this down.  Topher's shoes are 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoes.  We know Topher's shoes are 100 inches long.  Let's figure out how long Bobby's shoes are.

*  Let 'x' represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
*  We know that 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe is 9x.
*  We also know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe.  This means: 100 = 9x + 10

So, $5000 + $1500 - $5400 = $0.

"Let's break this down:

* The regulation passed with twice as many votes in favor as against it. 
* We know there were 33 people on the council.

This means the number of votes for the regulation is twice the number of votes against it.  

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of votes against the regulation.  The number of votes in favor is then 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes for and against the regulation, so:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms: 3x = 33

To find the number of votes against the regulation, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 33 / 3 = 11

The number of votes in favor is 2x, so:

2 * 11 = 22

**Answer: 22**

"To figure out how many shirts Krissa ordered, we need to break down the number of students needing each size:

* **Large:** Half the number of medium students is 18 / 2 = 9 students.
* **Extra-large:** Six more than the size large students is 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, add up the number of students for each size: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 65 students.

"Okay, so Mike has 600 movies.  He wants to get rid of his old ones and get digital copies.  

* He knows that a third of his movies are in series, and he can get those for only $6 each. 
* The rest of his movies are regular movies.
* 40% of the regular movies are older movies, and they cost $5 each.

To figure out how much it costs to replace all his movies, we need to figure out how many regular movies he has and how much they cost. 

**Here's how to do it:**

1. **Series movies:** Mike has 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies in series.
2. **Regular movies:** Mike has 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies that aren't in series.
3. **Cost of older movies:** 400 movies * $5/movie = $2000
4. **Cost of regular movies:** 400 movies * $10/movie = $4000
5. **Total cost:** $2000 + $4000 = $6000

**So, it costs Mike $6000 to replace all his movies.**

"Okay, so Billy gets a raise after two months and then again on his anniversary.  We need to figure out how much more money Billy makes than Sally.

* Billy's starting rate was $10 per hour.
* He gets a $0.50 raise after two months, so his rate is now $10.50 per hour.
* Then, he gets a $1.00 raise on his anniversary, making his rate $11.50 per hour.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    *  Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    *  Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    *  Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    *  We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    *  We know she uses 10 ounces of the mixture.

* **Solve for the amount of oil (o):**
    *  Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    *  Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    *  Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x 
    *  We know x = zest, so o = 4z

* **Find the amount of oil (o):**

"Paul needs 63 cupcakes for his birthday party. He already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.  To figure out how many more he needs, we find the total number of cupcakes he has: 8 + 40 = 48.  Then, we subtract that from the total he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.  So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes. 

**Answer:** 15

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Joe's cars:** Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. So Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.
* **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.
* **Cars given to mother:** Joe gives away twice the number he sold to his mother, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.
* **Cars remaining:** Joe starts with 40 cars and sells 8, then gives away 16, leaving him with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.

**Answer:** 16

"Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food and 6 packages of dog food.  Each package of cat food has 11 tins, and each package of dog food has 6 tins.  To find out how many more cat food tins she bought than dog food tins, we need to do a few things:

1. **Find the total number of cat food tins:** 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
2. **Find the total number of dog food tins:** 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins
3. **Find the difference:** 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

**Answer:** Kimberly bought 52 more cat food tins than dog food tins.

"Let's figure this out!

* Let's say PJ has 'x' cards. 
* Smendrick has 3 times that amount, so he has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.

We know the total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Now we can solve for x:
* 7x + 12 = 341
* 7x = 329
* x = 47 

So PJ has 47 cards.  To find Becca's cards, we use the information that she has 3x + 12 cards.
* Becca has 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Cindy has 5 green eggs.
* She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
* She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
* To find the total number of eggs, we add all the types: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Okay, so Milly has to return a book that was kind of boring.  It weighs 4 pounds, cost $32, and needs to be sent 20 miles away.  The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  Amazon will only give her 75% of the book's price back.  

To figure out how much Milly will lose, we need to do a few things:

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   * The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound, so that's 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.
   * The book needs to be shipped 20 miles, and the cost per mile is $0.08, so that's 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.
   * The total cost to ship the book is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

2. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   * The book cost $32, and Amazon will only give her 75% back, so she'll get $32 * 0.75 = $24.00 back.

3. **Calculate the final cost Milly will lose:**
   * The total cost to ship the book is $3.00, and she'll get $24.00 back, so she'll lose $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00.


**Answer:** Milly will lose $21.00.

"Mulan starts with $40. Her dad gives her $100. She buys two pairs of jeans for $30 each, and a bag for $20.  

To find out how much money she has left, we need to figure out the total cost of the jeans and the bag.  The jeans cost $30 each, and she buys two pairs, so that's $30 * 2 = $60.  The bag costs $20.  So, the total cost is $60 + $20 = $80.

Mulan has $140 total.  To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total cost from her starting amount: $140 - $80 = $60. 

**Answer:** $60

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Week 1:** Boris makes 8,000 bars.
* **Week 2:** He makes half as much as week 1, so he makes 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He makes three times as much as week 1, so he makes 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:**  He makes 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find out how much he makes in week 4, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris makes 14,000 bars in week 4.

* **Chandeliers:** She has 2 chandeliers, and each one costs $15.00 to hang, so that's 2 * $15.00 = $30.00
* **Pictures:** She has 20 pictures, and each one costs $15.00 to hang, so that's 20 * $15.00 = $300.00

So, the total cost is $129.00 + $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $529.00

"Here's how to figure out how much money Roy has:

* **Anthony's savings:** We know Eva saved $20.00, and Anthony saved $10.00 more than her, so Anthony saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
* **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, which means he saved 1.40 times Anthony's amount.  To find out how much Roy saved, we multiply Anthony's savings by 1.40: $30.00 * 1.40 = $42.00.

**Answer:** Roy has $42.00.

"Okay, so we know Pompei can lift 1 inch, and Saskay can lift 12 times that.  So Saskay can lift 12 inches.  Then Kagiyami can lift 4 times that, which is 48 inches.  And Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.  Finally, to get the answer in feet, we divide by 12 inches per foot.  So Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet. 


**Answer:** 40 feet

"Here's how to figure out Mason's total distance:

* **First leg:** He travels 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, so he goes 8 * 4 = 32 miles.
* **Second leg:** He keeps going for another 6 hours at 8 miles per hour, so he travels 8 * 6 = 48 miles.
* **Total:**  His total distance is 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.

**Answer:** 80 miles 
"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Think about the relationship between speed, time, and distance:**  The time it takes to travel a distance is related to the speed and distance.  
* **Let's use variables:** Let's say the speed of a kangaroo is 'k' and the time it takes to travel is 't'.
* **Set up an equation:** We know that distance is the same for all the animals, so we can write:  t = distance / speed.
* **Substitute and solve:**  We know the total time for 3 kangaroos is 18 hours, so 18 = distance / k.  
* **Now, let's consider the turtles:**  The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is k/2.
* **Find the new time:**  The time for four turtles is 18 hours. 

**Answer:** 36 hours

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Kora made 20 dishes.
* Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
* Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.
* To find the total, add the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

So the answer is 140.

* **Soda:** 3 bottles of soda cost $3.00 per bottle, so that's 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
* **Water:** 2 bottles of water cost $2.00 per bottle, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00
* **Total:**  $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

So, David will pay $13.00 for 3 soda and 2 water bottles.

"David has $12.48 and wants to buy 16 bolts that cost $0.03 each.  To figure out how much money he'll have left, we need to find the total cost of the bolts.  

*  16 bolts * $0.03/bolt = $0.48
*  $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

David will have $12.00 left.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Paul starts with 52 marbles.
* His friend gives him 28 more, so he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.
* He loses 1/4 of his marbles, which is (1/4) * 80 = 20 marbles.
*  He has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.

So the answer is 60.

"Okay, so Amy has 10 multiple-choice questions, 20 true/false questions, and 5 long answer questions.  

* Multiple Choice: 10 questions * 0.80 (correct) = 8 points
* True/False: 20 questions * 0.90 (correct) = 18 points
* Long Answer: 5 questions * 5 (points) = 25 points

Adding those up, she gets 8 + 18 + 25 = 51 points.

"Okay, so Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 from selling chickens. He's selling each chicken for $50.  He has 300 chickens.  He wants to sell 3/5 of them.  

To figure out how much he spent on the chickens, we need to figure out how much he'll make.  

* He'll sell 3/5 of his chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 = 180 chickens.
* He'll make $50 per chicken * 180 chickens = $9000 from selling them.
* To make a $2000 profit, he needs to make $9000 - $2000 = $7000. 

So, he needs to have spent $7000 on the chickens. 



 
"
"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Julie sold 14 glasses.
* The boys sold an equal number of glasses, so they each sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.
* To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract: 14 - 18 = -4. 

**Answer:** -4 


"
"Here's how to figure out how much Iris spent:

* **Manicure cost:** She spent $400 / 4 = $100 on a manicure.
* **Pedicure cost:** She spent $100 * (3/4) = $75 on a pedicure.
* **Total cost:**  $400 + $100 + $75 = $575 

So, Iris spent $575 at the spa. 


**Answer:** $575

"Sarah sells her rope for $40.  To figure out how much money she'll have left after buying a new rope, we need to know how many meters of the new rope she buys.  Let's say she buys 'x' meters of the new rope.  

The cost of the new rope is $1.50 per meter times 'x' meters, which is $1.50x.  

To find out how much money Sarah has left, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she made from selling the old rope: $40 - $1.50x.

"Let's break this down:

* Melanie is 8 years old now.
* In 10 years, she'll be 18. 
* This means she's 8 + 10 = 18 years old in 10 years.

To find out how many years it takes for her age to be three times her current age, we need to figure out when she'll be 3 * 8 = 24 years old.

Let's think about it:

* Melanie is 8 years old now.
* In 'x' years, she'll be 8 + x years old.
* We want to find 'x' when 8 + x = 24.

Solving for 'x':

* 8 + x = 24
* x = 24 - 8
* x = 16

So, it will take **16 years** for her age to be three times her current age.

"Let's break down Kelly's grocery shopping:

* **Bacon:** 5 packs cost $10, so each pack costs $10 / 5 = $2.
* **Chicken:** Each chicken pack costs twice as much as bacon, so they cost $2 * 2 = $4.
* **Chicken cost:** Kelly has 6 packs of chicken, so they cost $4 * 6 = $24.
* **Strawberries:** Each strawberry pack costs $4, and she has 3 packs, so they cost $4 * 3 = $12.
* **Apples:** Each apple pack costs half the price of a strawberry pack, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2. Kelly has 7 packs, so they cost $2 * 7 = $14.
* **Total cost:**  The total cost of all the items is $2 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $52.
* **Money left:** Kelly has $65 to spend, and her total cost is $52. She has $65 - $52 = $13 left.

"Let's break this down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let Peter's age be ""P""
    *  Let Paul's age be ""P + 10"" (since he's 10 years older than John)
    *  Let John's age be ""J""

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
    * P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

* **Solve for the ages:**
    *  Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    *  Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    *  We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Since P = P + 10 + J, substitute the value of J we just found: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Answer:**  Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.

"Okay, so Cameron wants to stay at the hotel for a bit longer.  He's got a choice: pay for a full 24 hours or just pay for the extra hours he'll be staying. 

Here's how to figure out which is cheaper:

* **Option 1: Full 24 hours** - This costs 1600 pesos.
* **Option 2: Extra hours** - He's staying for 12 hours, and then adds 70 pesos per hour after that.  So, he'll pay 70 pesos for each of the extra 12 hours. 

Let's see how much that costs: 70 pesos/hour * 12 hours = 840 pesos.

Now, let's add that to the cost of the 12-hour stay: 1600 pesos + 840 pesos = 2440 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 2440 pesos - 1600 pesos = 840 pesos.

   *  Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
   *  Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

* **We know:**
   * B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
   * B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
   * A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

* **Let's use the first two equations to find A:**
   * Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:
     * D + 10 = A + 20
     * A = D - 10

* **Now we can plug A into the third equation:**
   * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

* **Simplify and solve for D:**
   * 3D + 10 = 45
   * 3D = 35
   * D = 35 / 3

"Let's figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught!

We know Alex has 5 more Pokemon than Stan, and Stan has 13 fewer than 4 times the number Adelwolfe caught.  

Let's use variables to make things easier:

*  Let 'A' be the number of Pokemon Alex caught.
*  Let 'S' be the number of Pokemon Stan caught.
*  Let 'W' be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.

We can write down what we know about their catches:

*  A = S + 5  
*  S = 4W - 13
*  A + S + W = 339

Now, let's use the first two equations to help us find 'S' (Stan's catch):

*  Substitute the first equation into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
*  Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
*  Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
*  Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
*  Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
*  Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
*  Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

Now that we know how many Pokemon Adelwolfe caught, we can find Stan's catch:

*  Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
*  Simplify: S = 164 - 13
*  Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan caught 151 Pokemon.

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **First plane:**  The first plane flies to Greece three-quarters of the time, so it flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany:** The rest of the flights are split equally between France and Germany, meaning (1/4)x flights go to each of those places.
* **Other plane:** The other plane flies to Poland, and it makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes.

**To figure out how many flights to France the first plane makes, we need to figure out the total number of flights the first plane makes.**

* **The other plane's trips are half the first plane's trips:** 44 = (1/2) * x
* **Solving for x:** x = 44 * 2 = 88

**Therefore, the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.**

"Okay, so the pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  To figure out how much water they need, we multiply the length, width, and depth. That gives us 25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet. 

Now, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons.  Remember that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. So, 1400 cubic feet is equal to 1400 * 7.48 gallons = 10,392 gallons.

Finally, the pool company charges $0.10 per gallon, so the total cost is 10,392 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $1039.20.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Blue sticks:** They have 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.
* **Yellow sticks:** They have 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.
* **Total sticks:** They have 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.

So the answer is 34.

"To figure out how much farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to find the difference in their distances. 

* **Matteo's distance:**  He drove for 4 hours at 55 miles per hour, so he traveled 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.
* **Shandy's distance:** She drove for 10 hours at 45 miles per hour, so she traveled 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.
* **The difference:** Shandy drove 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles farther than Matteo. 


**Answer:** 230 miles

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Students over 16:** Half of the students are over 16, so there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students.
* **Male students over 16:** One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so there are 1500 * (1/4) = 375 male students.
* **Female students under 16:** The rest of the students are under 16, so there are 3000 - 1500 = 1500 students.
* **Female students under 16:** Half of the students under 16 are female, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 female students.


**Answer:** 750

"Okay, let's break this down:

* **Day 1:** Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of that, which is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.  They pump a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.
* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she did on Day 1, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she did on Day 1, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons. They pump a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.
* **Total:**  They pump a total of 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons in two days.
* **Remaining:**  To find out how much is left, we subtract the total pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.


**Answer:** 6000 gallons

"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Think about the power bank's charge:**  We know it started at 100% and lost some charge.
* **First 5 hours:**  It lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, so it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.
* **Remaining charge:**  After 5 hours, it had 55% of its charge left.
* **Next 3 hours:**  It lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, so it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.
* **Final charge:**  After 8 hours, it had 28% of its charge left.

"Okay, so Janet makes $25 per week working.  She wants to save 20% of $10,000 for a car.  To figure out how many weeks she needs to work, we need to figure out how much she saves each week.  She saves $5 each week.  To figure out how many weeks it will take to save $10,000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly savings.  So, she'll need to work for 2000 weeks.

"Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. He wants to buy some fruit, but he already has some peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples.  Let's figure out how many plums he can buy.

* Peaches cost $0.50 each, pears cost $0.50 each, kiwis cost $1.00 each, and apples cost $0.75 each. 

First, let's see how much he's spent on the fruit he already has:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Now, let's see how much money he has left:

* $10.00 - $1.50 - $2.00 - $2.00 - $3.75 = $2.25

He can buy 2.25 / $0.25/plum = 9 plums. 


**Answer:** Jamaar can buy 9 plums.

"Anne has 900 pieces of sweets in total. She gives 2 packs to her friends, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.  She then gives the rest of the sweets to her 10 friends, which is 900 - 120 = 780 pieces.  Each of her friends gets 780 / 10 = 78 pieces. 


**Answer:** 78

"The price of carrots increases by 5% each year.  So, after three years, the price will be:

* Year 1: $120 * 1.05 = $126
* Year 2: $126 * 1.05 = $133.70
* Year 3: $133.70 * 1.05 = $139.76

The price of carrots after three years is **$139.76**.

"Here's how to figure out the number of guests:

* **Start with the total guests:** The hotel had 100 guests.
* **Early checkouts:** 24 people checked out early.
* **Late checkouts:** 15 people checked out late.
* **Afternoon check-ins:** Twice the number of late checkout guests means 15 * 2 = 30 people checked in.
* **Dinner check-ins:** 7 more people checked in after dinner.
* **Total guests:**  To find the total, add all the guests: 100 - 24 - 15 + 30 + 7 = 113 

**Answer:** 113

"Okay, so we know there are 60 questions total.  40% are easy, so that's 24 questions.  The rest are split into average and difficult questions, which is 36.  

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions right, so that's 18 points.  She also gets half of the average and difficult questions right, which is 9 points.

Finally, we add those points together to get a total of 18 + 9 = 27 points.

"Let's break this down:

* **Let 'x' be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.**
* **Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**So, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"To find the total number of sandwiches they eat in a week, we need to figure out how many sandwiches they eat each day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. 

* The man eats 5 sandwiches a day.
* The wife eats 4 sandwiches a day.
* Their son eats 2 sandwiches a day.

So, in total, they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches each day.

There are 7 days in a week.  

Therefore, the family eats 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches in a week.

"Suzanne made $80 from selling cookies and $240 from selling cupcakes.  She also got $20 from her sisters.  To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the cost of her gifts from her total earnings.  

Here's how:

* Total earnings: $80 + $240 = $320
* Gifts: $20
* Money left: $320 - $20 = $300

Suzanne has $300 left.

"
"Here's how to solve this:

* **Step 1:**  A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds per day.
* **Step 2:** A steel pickaxe mines 1.5 times more than an iron pickaxe, so it mines 1.5 * 12 = 18 pounds per day.
* **Step 3:**  If 40 dwarves use steel pickaxes, they mine 18 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 720 pounds per day.
* **Step 4:**  Over 30 days, they mine 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21,600 pounds.

**Answer:** 21,600 
"
"The store sells the sandwiches in different sizes, and the prices are proportional.  This means the price per sandwich is the same for all sizes. 

* The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3, so each sandwich costs $3 / 2 = $1.50.
* The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6, so each sandwich costs $6 / 4 = $1.50.

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages.  The 8-sandwich package will cost $1.50/sandwich * 8 = $12.00. 


**Answer:** $12.00

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Worst-case scenario:**  The substitute teacher doesn't give an extension, and Marcus doesn't get an extension from the normal teacher. That's 50% chance of a substitute and 40% chance of an extension.
* **Best-case scenario:** Marcus gets an extension from the normal teacher, and the substitute teacher doesn't give an extension. That's 40% chance of an extension.
* **The middle ground:** Marcus doesn't get an extension from the normal teacher, and the substitute teacher doesn't give an extension. That's 20% chance of no extension.

So, the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is 20% + 8% = 28%.

"Okay, so Melissa works for 3 days, and each day she works 6 hours.  She gets paid $15 a day, but has to pay $3 for parking.  To figure out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we need to figure out how much she makes each day after expenses.  She makes $15 - $3 = $12 each day.  Then we need to figure out how much she makes per hour.  She works 18 hours total, so she makes $12 / 18 = $0.67 per hour. 


**Answer:** $0.67

"Okay, so Jim goes to college for 4 years and gets $50,000 a year in loans.  His job before college paid him $25,000 a year.  His degree makes his income triple, so he makes $75,000 a year now.  

To figure out how long it takes to make up for the money he lost by not working, we need to figure out how much he makes in total.  He'll make $75,000 a year for 4 years, so that's $75,000 * 4 = $300,000.  He also lost $25,000 a year for 4 years, so that's $25,000 * 4 = $100,000.  

So, he needs to make $300,000 and he's already made $300,000.  That means it will take him 0 years to make up for the money he lost.

"Okay, so they delivered 425 letters on Monday.  On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of that amount, which is 425/5 = 85.  So they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.  Then on Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, which is 2 * 102 = 204.  Finally, they delivered 5 more than that, so they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.  To find the total, we add up all the deliveries: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Molly needs to pay for 10 people's chicken salad at $6.50 per person and 6 people's pasta salad at $6 per person.  

To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad separately.

* Chicken salad cost: 10 people * $6.50/person = $65.00
* Pasta salad cost: 6 people * $6/person = $36.00
* Total cost: $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00

So, Molly will pay $101.00 for the catering.

"Okay, so Johnny's dad bet money on horse races.  Here's how to figure out his average loss:

* **Race 1:** He lost $5.
* **Race 2:** He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race, so he won $10 (twice $5). Then he won $1 more, so he won $11.
* **Race 3:** He lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the second race, which is $16.50.
* **Total Loss:**  He lost a total of $5 + $11 + $16.50 = $32.50.
* **Average Loss:** His average loss per race is $32.50 / 3 races = $10.83.

"Okay, so we have three people sharing $1920.  The second person got $80 more than the first, and the third got twice what the second got.  To figure out how much the first person got, we need to figure out how much each person got.

Let's break it down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' be the amount the first person got.
    *  The second person got x + $80.
    *  The third person got 2(x + $80).

* **Set up an equation:**  The total amount divided by the number of people equals the share of each person:
    * (x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

* **Solve for x:**
    * (4x + $160) / 3 = $1920
    * 4x + $160 = $5760
    * 4x = $5600
    * x = $1400

* **The first person got $1400.**

"Okay, so they worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  That's a lot of painting!  To figure out how many hours they worked, we need to figure out how many days they worked. 

First, we need to figure out how many days are in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Now, they worked 3/8 of a day each day for 21 days, so that's (3/8) * 21 = 63/8 days.

To convert that to hours, we know there are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply 63/8 by 24. That gives us 63/8 * 24 = 189 hours.

Finally, we divide the total hours by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.  That's 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours per painter.

"Let's figure this out!

* Let's say Rory retrieved 'x' balls in the second set. 

* In the first set, he retrieved 'x + 4' balls.

* In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved 'x/2' balls.

* The total number of balls he retrieved is the sum of all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

* To find 'x', we can solve this equation:
    * Combine like terms: (5/2)x + 4 = 19
    * Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
    * Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

* So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.

*  The first set was x + 4, so he retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.


**Answer:** Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"Here's how to figure out the price of the car in 2010:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is like taking 21 out of every 100 dollars.  So, it loses $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The car is now worth $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):**  The car loses another 21% of its value, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The car is now worth $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):**  The car loses another 21% of its value, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The car is now worth $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"To figure this out, we need to know how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in a day. She drinks 8 cups of water each day.  We know there are 16 cups in a gallon. So, to find out how many gallons she drinks in a day, we divide the number of cups she drinks by the number of cups in a gallon. 

That gives us 8 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons.

Now, to find out how much water she drinks in 30 days, we multiply the amount she drinks per day by the number of days. So, 0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons. 


**Answer:** 15 gallons

"Okay, so James' insurance went up 60% after his accident.  

His normal monthly cost is $120.  To find out how much he pays a year, we need to figure out how much his insurance costs now.

*  His new monthly cost is $120 + $72 = $192
*  Since he pays this every month, his yearly cost is $192 * 12 = $2304

So, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

"Okay, so the doctor charges $200 for the cast, $300 for a 30-minute visit, $4 per pill for 30 painkillers, and $6 for parking.  

To figure out the total cost, we need to add up all those costs:

* **Visit:** $300 for 30 minutes, which is half an hour, so we need to multiply that by 0.5.
* **Painkillers:**  We need to multiply the price per pill by the number of pills.
* **Parking:** We need to multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours.

So, the total cost is $150 (visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $282.

"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out coupons. He wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons.  

* **Big coupons:** He sends twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he sends 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.
* **Cost of small coupons:** Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so he spends 700 * 0.05 = 35 cents on small coupons.
* **Cost of big coupons:** Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so he spends 1400 * 0.15 = 210 cents on big coupons.
* **Total postage:** He spends 35 cents + 210 cents = 245 cents in total.

"Okay, let's break down how much money Terry makes:

* **Milkshakes:** He sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, so that's 6 * $5.50 = $33.00
* **Burger Platters:** He sells 9 platters at $11 each, so that's 9 * $11 = $99.00
* **Sodas:** He sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, so that's 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

To find his total earnings, we add all those amounts together: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00

So, Terry makes a total of $162.00.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let's say Sam has 'x' feet of fence. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry has 'x + 60' feet.

The total length of fence is 100 feet, so:
x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

So, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet.

To find out how much is left for Sam, subtract Harry's fence from the total fence: 100 - 80 = 20 feet.


**Answer:** Sam has 20 feet left over.

He sold 300 bikes in total.  Half of those were Trekking bikes, which is 300 / 2 = 150.  Then 15% were BMX bikes, which is 300 * 0.15 = 45.  The rest were MTBs, so 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

So, Marcel made $52,500 from MTBs, $11,250 from BMXs, and $6,750 from Trekking bikes.  That's a total of $70,500.

"To figure out how much longer it takes to ride the bigger slide, we need to find the difference in time. 

* The biggest slide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute.
* The second biggest slide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet per minute.

To find the time it takes to ride the biggest slide, we divide the length by the speed: 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes.

"Okay, so Lauren wants to save for retirement.  She's saving 20% of her paycheck, which is a good start!  

To figure out how long she needs to work, we need to know how much she'll save over 20 years.  

First, we need to figure out how much she saves each year.  She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is $20,000.

Then, we need to figure out how much she spends each year. She wants to live on 40% of her salary, which is $40,000.

So, she has $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000 left each year to save.

To figure out how much she needs to save over 20 years, we multiply her annual savings by the number of years: $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000.

So, she needs to save $1,200,000.  

To figure out how long she needs to work, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her annual savings: $1,200,000 / $60,000 = 20 years.

**Answer:** 20 years

"To figure this out, we need to figure out what percentage of the school's students are girls.  We know that 40% of the students are boys, and we know there are 240 boys.  

Let's think about this like a proportion: 40/100 = 240/x, where x is the total number of students.

Cross-multiplying, we get 40 * x = 240 * 100.  Simplifying, we get 40x = 24000.  Solving for x, we find that there are 600 students in total.

Since there are 40% boys, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students: 600 - 240 = 360 girls.


**Answer:** There are 360 girls in the school.

"Let's break this down step-by-step:

* **Let's use variables:**  We can use 'x' to represent the length of the yellow rope.
* **The blue rope:** The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* **The red rope:** The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.
* **The total length:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.

**Putting it all together:**

We know the total length is 37, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Solving for x:**

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12 (This is the length of the yellow rope)

**Finding the red rope length:**

The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, which is 'x - 7'.  So, the red rope is 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.


**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

    *  Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years:  W = 5(C + 7)
    * In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

* **Solve for C:**  We can use the first equation to solve for W in terms of C:
    * W = 5(C + 7)
    * W = 5C + 35

* **Substitute and simplify:** Now substitute this value of W into the second equation:
    * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
    * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
    * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
    * C + 5 = (5/3)C
    * (2/3)C = 5
    * C = 25/2

* **The answer:** Colin is 12.5 years old.

"Okay, so John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.  He also buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which costs 50% more than scotch.  To figure out how much he spends on cognac, we need to figure out how much each bottle of cognac costs.  Since cognac costs 50% more than scotch, we know it costs 1.50 times the price of scotch.  So, he buys 20 bottles of cognac.  To find the total cost of the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the price per bottle.  That's 20 bottles * $15 per bottle = $300.  Finally, to find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of the scotch and the cognac.  That's $600 + $300 = $900.

"Let's solve this problem!

We know that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40.  Let's use a variable to represent the number of mugs:

* Let 'x' be the number of coffee mugs.

* Four times the number of mugs is 4x.

* Eight more than four times the number is 4x + 8.

We're told this is equal to 40: 4x + 8 = 40

Now we can solve for x:

1. Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
2. Divide both sides by 4: x = 8

So, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Finally, add up the water removed from all the settings: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters**

"So, for one dose, she uses 14 mL of medicine + 3 times that amount, which is 42 mL.  That means she uses a total of 14 + 42 = 56 mL per dose.  If she makes 8 doses, she'll use 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL. 

**Answer:** 448 mL

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Ali's class is 120 students big.
* Each of John's classes is 1/8 the size of Ali's class, so each class has 120 / 8 = 15 students.
* John has two classes, so his classes have a total of 15 * 2 = 30 students.
* The total capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150 students.

**Answer:** 150

"Okay, so Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to pay back $306 with 2% extra.  He'll pay $25 each month for 11 months, and then pay the rest on the 12th month.  So, how much will he pay in the 12th month? 

Here's how to figure it out:

* **Calculate the interest:**  He'll pay an extra $6 for the loan.
* **Total amount to pay:**  He'll pay $306 (the original amount plus the interest).
* **Calculate the total amount paid in the 12th month:**  He'll pay $306 + ($25 * 11) = $306 + $275 = $581. 


**Answer:** $581

"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Find the volume of the jar:** The jar is a square, so we need to find the volume of that.  It's 6 inches by 6 inches, and 15 inches tall.  So, the volume is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.
* **Calculate the volume of the jelly beans:**  The jelly beans are packed in the jar, so we need to figure out how much space they take up.  We know the jar is 540 cubic inches, and we know they're packed 80% efficiently.  So, the volume of the jelly beans is 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.
* **Find the number of jelly beans:**  We know the volume of the jelly beans is 432 cubic inches, and each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.  So, we can figure out how many jelly beans are in there by dividing the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.
* **Calculate the difference:**  We know the actual number of red jelly beans is 900.  We also know there are 2880 jelly beans in the jar.  So, the difference is 2880 - 900 = 1980.

"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then it gets 40 more people on the first stop.  Then another 3/4 of those people get on the bus at the second stop.  So, we know there are 60 people on the bus after the first stop.  Then 30 more people get on the bus at the second stop.  So, there are 90 people on the bus.  The bus then doubles the number of people on the bus at the third stop.  So, there are 180 people on the bus.  The bus needs to have 20 more people to fill up all the seats.

"To figure out how long it takes for everyone to try the escape room, we need to consider the number of groups and the time allotted for each group. 

* **Total students:** 4 grades * 10 students/grade = 40 students
* **Groups:** 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups
* **Total time:** 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes

**Answer:** 225 minutes

"Ali has to pay John $100. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* John made 4 tables at $20 each, so that's 4 * $20 = $80
* He also made 2 roof frames at $10 each, so that's 2 * $10 = $20
* The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100

"Let's break this down.  Ian has a board that's 40 feet long.  He wants to cut it into two pieces.  The longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece.  

To find the length of the longer piece, we need to figure out how long the shorter piece is first.  

Let's say the shorter piece is 'x'.  The longer piece is then 4 times that length, or 4x.

The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces, so we can write an equation: x + 4x = 40.

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  

To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 5: x = 8.

Now that we know the shorter piece is 8 feet long, we can find the length of the longer piece: 4 * 8 = 32.

**Answer: 32**

"Aiden needs 10 tablespoons of seasoning. 
 
Here's how we figure that out:

* **Meatballs per pound:** He makes 16 meatballs per pound of beef.
* **Total beef:** He wants 80 meatballs, so he needs 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of beef.
* **Seasoning:** He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound, so he needs 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons.

"Luke needs to buy fabric for 5 windows, each 35 inches wide.  He wants to buy twice the total width of the windows, so he needs to buy fabric for 2 * 175 inches = 350 inches.

"
"So, the first 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, so that's 16 * 0.25 = $4.00. Then, the next 20 minutes cost $0.20 per minute, so that's 20 * 0.20 = $4.00.  The total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00. 

**Answer:** $8.00

"Let's figure this out!

* Let's say Carly made 'c' cupcakes.
* She makes 'b' brownies. 
* We know the number of brownies is 3 times the number of cupcakes minus 2.  So, b = 3c - 2.

We also know that the class has 5 people and each person gets 2 treats.  That means the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10.

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to figure out what 'c' would make the total number of treats equal to 10.

So, we can set up an equation:

c + b = 10

We know b = 3c - 2, so we can substitute that in:

c + (3c - 2) = 10

Now, let's solve for 'c':

4c - 2 = 10
4c = 12
c = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes!

"Susan gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year, plus 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.  The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so it sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues.  In total, she gets 3 * 12 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues. 

**Answer:** 66

"Let's break this down!

We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more than Kim.  We also know Samantha has 27 paintings.  

Let's use 'x' to represent the number of paintings Kim has.  

* Shelley has x + 8 paintings.
* Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

Since Samantha has 27 paintings, we can set up an equation: 
(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Now, let's solve for x:
* x - 4 = 27
* x = 31

**Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.**

"To find the mean score, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the total number of scores. 

Here's how:

* **Sum the scores:** 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 570
* **Divide the sum by the number of scores:** 570 / 9 = 63.33

So the mean score is 63.33.

"Eve started with 20 pomelos.  She gave some away, and now has 5 left.  To find out how many she gave away, we need to find the difference between the starting amount and the amount she has left.  

The answer is 20 - 5 = 15. 

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

"Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we need to figure out what fraction of her total novels she wrote last year.  Since 3 quarters of her novels from last year is 9, we can figure out how many she wrote this year by dividing 9 by 3/4.  

**Answer:** 12 novels

"Okay, so Michael is driving from Alaska to Texas.  He's going 50 km per hour, and he's driving for three days.  To figure out how far he's traveled, we need to multiply his speed by the number of hours he's driving each day.  That's 50 km/hour * 24 hours/day = 1200 km per day.  Then, we multiply that by the number of days he's driving, which is 3 days.  That gives us 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km.  Finally, we need to figure out what percentage of the total distance he's traveled.  The total distance is 6000 km.  So, we divide the distance he's traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100%.  That gives us 3600 km / 6000 km * 100% = 60%. 


**Answer: 60%**

"Here's how to figure out how much Bud spends on macaroni and cheese in a year:

* **Cheese cost:** He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for gruyere, so he spends $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 on gruyere.
* **Total cheese cost:**  The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00
* **Yearly cost:** He makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in a year he makes 52 weeks * $9.00/week = $468.00

**Answer:** $468.00

"Here's how to figure out how many white hats Skyler has:

* **Red hats:** Half of the hats are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.
* **Hats left:**  Skyler has 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.
* **Blue hats:**  3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, so there are (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
* **White hats:**  The rest are white, so there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

**Answer:** Skyler has 20 white hats.

"Here's how to figure out the cost per stick:

* **Find the sale price:**  Archie gets a discount of $3.00, so the bag costs $15.00.
* **Calculate the cost per stick:**  Divide the total cost by the number of sticks: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick.
* **Convert to cents:** Multiply the cost per stick by 100: $0.50 * 100 cents/dollar = 50 cents.

**Answer:** 50 cents

"Let's figure this out!

We know Mary makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  We also know that Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's use variables to help us:

* Let 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes.
* Blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4: 5x - 4
* Total ice cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Now we can solve for x:

* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.

* Blueberry cubes: 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

**Answer: 96**

"To find the total points Ara has scored, we need to multiply the points per game by the number of games she plays each year. 

* She plays 40 games per year.
* Her score is 21 points per game.

So, her total points are: 40 games * 21 points/game = 840 points.

Over four years, she scores: 840 points/year * 4 years = 3360 points.

* **Candles:** 
    * Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 small candles.
    * The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 medium candles.
    * Total candles: 8 small candles + 8 medium candles = 16 candles.
* **Total:** They have 4 flashlights + 16 candles = 20 items in total.

"Tim works 6 hours a day at his job, and each call takes him 15 minutes.  To figure out how many calls he makes in a week, we need to figure out how many calls he makes in a day.  He makes 6 hours / 15 minutes/call = 40 calls a day.  Then, we need to figure out how many calls he makes in a week, which is 40 calls/day * 5 days/week = 200 calls.

"It takes 12 minutes for the new varnish to dry on each painting, so it will take 12 minutes * 6 paintings = 72 minutes for all of them to dry.  

The old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting, so it would take 7 minutes * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes longer to dry.

"Crista needs 12 cups of water for her plants. 
 
Here's how we figure that out:

* **Half-cup plants:** 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups
* **One-cup plants:** 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups
* **Quarter-cup plants:** 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants
* **Total cups for quarter-cup plants:** 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups
* **Total water needed:** 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

"Okay, so Phineas needs to hop 100 yards on land and then swim another 100 yards.  

* **Land travel:** He hops at 20 yards per minute, so it'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.
* **Swimming:** He swims at 10 yards per minute, so it'll take him 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

To get back home, he'll need 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"Here's how to figure out the total number of people Conor saw:

* **Day 1:** 50 people
* **Day 2:** 50 + 20 = 70 people
* **Day 3:** 70 * 2 = 140 people
* **Total for the first three days:** 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people
* **People seen the rest of the week:** 60 people/day * 5 days = 300 people
* **Total for the week:** 260 + 300 = 560 people

**Answer:** 560

"Okay, let's break down the popcorn problem:

* **First 30 seconds:** Garrett gets 20 kernels popping.
* **Next 30 seconds:**  The popping rate triples, so he gets 20 * 3 = 60 kernels popping.
* **Next 30 seconds:** The rate is quadrupled, so he gets 60 * 4 = 240 kernels popping.
* **Final 30 seconds:** The rate is halved, so he gets 240 / 2 = 120 kernels popping.
* **Total:**  He gets 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels popping.
* **Residual heat:**  The kernels left over from the heat will pop another 120 kernels.

**Answer:** Garrett has 440 kernels to eat.

"To figure out how much dog food they need in a week, we need to add up the food each dog eats per day. 

* German Shepherds eat 5 kg of food each day.
* Bulldogs eat 3 kg of food each day.

So, in a week, they'll eat:

* 5 kg/day * 7 days/week = 35 kg
* 3 kg/day * 7 days/week = 21 kg

That means they'll need a total of 35 kg + 21 kg = 56 kg of dog food in a week.

"Here's how to figure out the total number of animal legs:

* **Two-legged animals:** 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs
* **Four-legged animals:** 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs
* **Total legs:** 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

So the answer is 80.

"Let's break this down:

* We know the tower has 4 blue blocks.
* It has twice as many yellow blocks, so there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.
* The total number of blocks is 32.
* We can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total: 32 - 12 = 20.

**Answer:** 20

"So, Gary bought a boat for $9000.  The first year it lost 30% of its value, so it's worth $9000 - $9000 * 0.30 = $6300.  The second year it lost another 30% of that value, so it's worth $6300 - $6300 * 0.30 = $4410.  Finally, the third year it lost 20% of its value, leaving it at $4410 - $4410 * 0.20 = $3528. 

**Answer:** $3528

"Here's how to figure out how many pink Starbursts are in the bag:

* **Orange candies:** The bag has twice the number of red candies, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.
* **Yellow candies:** Half the number of red candies is 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.
* **Total red, orange, and yellow candies:**  There are 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies in total.
* **Pink candies:**  To find out how many are pink, we subtract the total of the other colors from the total number of candies: 232 - 189 = 43 candies.

"Okay, so Helen stayed at a hotel for 3 nights and took the bus 7 times.  The hotel cost $80 per night, and each bus ride was 10% of that price.  

To figure out the total cost, we need to do a few things:

1. **Calculate the cost of each bus ride:**  10% of $80 is $8.
2. **Calculate the total cost of the bus rides:** 7 bus rides * $8 per ride = $56
3. **Calculate the total cost of the hotel:** 3 nights * $80 per night = $240
4. **Add the hotel and bus costs together:** $240 + $56 = $296

So, Helen spent $296 on her trip.

"To figure out how much force John needs to push his car, we need to consider the total weight of everything in it. 

* **Total weight:** The car weighs 1200 pounds and has luggage weighing 250 pounds, so that's 1200 + 250 = 1450 pounds.
* **Children's weight:**  His two children weigh 75 pounds each, so that's 75 * 2 = 150 pounds.
* **Total weight in the car:**  The total weight is 1450 pounds + 150 pounds = 1600 pounds.
* **Force needed:**  Since the force needed is 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0.01. That's 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

**Answer:** 16 pounds

"Okay, so Avery needs 3 place settings for each of her 12 guests.  That means she needs 36 place settings total. 

* Dinner plates cost $6 each, so she'll spend 36 * $6 = $216 on those.
* Bowls cost $5 each, so she'll spend 36 * $5 = $180 on those.
* Salad plates cost $4 each, so she'll spend 36 * $4 = $144 on those.

Finally, we add up all the costs: $216 + $180 + $144 = $540. 

**Answer:** $540.00

"Here's how to figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy:

1. **Calculate Ryan's allowance:** He gets $6 per week for chores, and he did chores for 3 weeks, so he has $6 * 3 = $18.
2. **Calculate the cost of the ice cream:**  He bought ice cream for 3 friends at $1.25 each, so that's 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.
3. **Calculate the total cost:**  The ice cream cost $3.75, and he has $18 in allowance, so he has $18 - $3.75 = $14.25 left.
4. **Calculate how many tickets he can buy:**  Tickets cost $6.50 each, and he has $14.25, so he can buy $14.25 / $6.50 = 2.2 tickets. 

Since he can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy **2** movie tickets. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the cost:

* Ellen spent $100 on leggings and $5 on a photo frame, for a total of $105.
* Lani bought sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each, so her total cost is $30 + (2 * $100) = $30 + $200 = $230.
*  To find the total, we add up Ellen's spending and Lani's spending: $105 + $230 = $335.

So, they spent a total of $335.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know Igor gathered some test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes.  We know he got half the number of test tubes as the doctor asked for, and he got two more Petri dishes than the doctor asked for.  The total number of items he put on the bench is 29.  

Let's figure out how many beakers he lost. 

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
    * Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    * We know he gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: p = 14 + 2 = 16
    * We know the total number of items is 29: t + p + beakers = 29

* **Solve for the number of beakers:**
    * We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 + 16 + beakers = 29
    * Simplify: 24 + beakers = 29
    * Subtract 24 from both sides: beakers = 5

* **Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers.

"The caretaker needs 606 feet of line in total.  Here's how we figure that out:

* **He needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.**
* **He has 200 feet of dock.**
* **So, he needs 200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet of line.**
* **He already has 6 feet of line.**
* **To find the total, add the new line to the existing line: 600 feet + 6 feet = 606 feet**

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Find James's current age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. James is twice her age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **Find John's age:** James was born when John was 19, so John is currently 19 + 32 = 51 years old.
* **Find the youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is currently 32 years old. In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

"Okay, so Mark's radiator is $400, but he gets it at a discount.  He gets 80% off, so it's $400 * 0.80 = $320.  Then he has to pay a mechanic to put it in.  It takes 3 hours and the mechanic charges $50 an hour, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.  Finally, he has to add the cost of the mechanic's work to the discounted price, so $320 + $150 = $470.
