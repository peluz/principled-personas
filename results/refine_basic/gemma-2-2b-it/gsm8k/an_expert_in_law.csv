"Josh's situation presents a potential legal issue.  While the increase in value of the house is significant, it's crucial to understand the legal implications of this transaction.  

**Here's why:**

* **Property Law:**  The purchase price and repairs are considered the basis for determining the value of the property for legal purposes.  
* **Appraisal:**  A professional appraisal is often required to determine the fair market value of a property.  
* **Contractual Obligations:**  Josh's contract with the seller likely outlines the terms of the sale, including any contingencies or warranties. 

**To determine the profit, we need to consider:**

* **Actual Sale Price:**  The final sale price of the house is the key factor in determining profit. 
* **Legal Fees:**  Legal fees associated with the transaction are also a factor. 

**Therefore, without the actual sale price, it's impossible to definitively determine Josh's profit.**

"Eliza's earnings for this week can be calculated by considering her regular pay and overtime pay.  

* **Regular Pay:**  Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours worked, so her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.
* **Overtime Pay:**  She works 5 additional hours, which qualifies as overtime.  Overtime pay is calculated as 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay is 5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = $60.

Let's plug in the numbers:

**Percentage of Hip-Hop Dance = (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%**


Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

"The question presents a scenario involving a price reduction.  To determine the original price, we need to work backward from the discounted price. 

Let's break it down:

* **The discount:** The book was sold at a 25% discount, meaning the price was reduced by 25% of its original value.
* **The discounted price:** The sale price of $19.50 represents the price after the discount.
* **The original price:** To find the original price, we need to calculate the price before the discount.

**To find the original price, we can use the following equation:**

Original Price = Discounted Price / (1 - Discount Percentage)

**Substituting the given values:**

Original Price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)

**Solving for the original price:**

Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75

Original Price = $26.00


 
**Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.**

"To determine the number of pizza boxes Marie ordered, we need to consider the total cost of her purchases and the price per box. 

We know the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $33.  We also know the total cost of the pizza is $17.  

Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the pizza boxes by subtracting the cost of the other items from the total cost: $50 - $33 = $17.  

Finally, we can determine the number of pizza boxes by dividing the cost of the pizza by the price per box: $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total.  We are also given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

To find the number of gold coins, we can use the following steps:

1. **Define variables:** Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.
2. **Represent the relationship:** Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as 'x + 30'.
3. **Set up the equation:** The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, so we have the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.
4. **Solve for x:** Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110.  Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80. Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.
5. **Calculate the number of gold coins:**  Since gold coins are 'x + 30', we substitute x = 40: 40 + 30 = 70.

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break down the problem. Mike played for a total of 40 minutes, and we need to determine his total points. 

We know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  The second 20 minutes saw a 25% increase in his scoring.  To calculate this increase, we can use the following formula:

* **Increase = (Percentage Increase / 100) * Original Value**

In this case, the percentage increase is 25%, and the original value is 4 points.  Therefore, the increase is:

* **Increase = (25 / 100) * 4 = 1 point**

This means Mike scored 4 + 1 = 5 points in the second 20 minutes.

Finally, to find the total points, we add the points from both segments: 4 + 5 = 9 points.

Therefore, Mike scored a total of 9 points.

"To determine John's speed, we need to consider the total distance he covers and the time he spends running. 

**Here's a breakdown:**

* **Daily Distance:** John runs 60 miles per week, and he runs 3 days a week.
* **Daily Distance Calculation:**  He runs 60 miles / 3 days = 20 miles per day.
* **Daily Running Time:** He runs for 3 hours on the first day.  The other two days, he runs for half as long, which is 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.
* **Total Running Time:**  He runs for a total of 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

**Calculating John's Speed:**

* **Average Speed:**  John's speed is calculated by dividing the total distance he runs by the total time he spends running. 
* **Speed:** 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.


**Therefore, John's speed is 10 miles per hour.**

"Let's break down the problem. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag.  We know the comic books weigh 1/4 of a pound each, and he removes 30 of them.  To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we need to consider the weight of the toys. 

The total weight of the comic books is 7.5 pounds.  We can then calculate the weight of the toys by subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total weight he needs to remove. 

The weight of the toys is 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds. 

To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the weight of the toys by the weight of each toy. 

The number of toys he needs to remove is 7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 15 toys.

"Let's break down the problem. Marcy's pension is structured in two phases.  

* **Phase 1:**  For the first 20 years, she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
* **Phase 2:** After 20 years, she receives 5% of the value of her pension from the first 20 years. 

To determine her pension after 30 years, we need to consider the total value of her pension from Phase 1 and the additional payments from Phase 2. 

**Important Note:**  The question doesn't specify if the pension is calculated on a yearly basis or a lump sum.  We'll assume it's a yearly calculation.

**Calculation:**

* **Phase 1:**  $50,000 per year for 20 years = $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000
* **Phase 2:**  5% of the value of the pension from Phase 1 = 5% * $1,000,000 = $50,000
* **Total Pension:** $1,000,000 + $50,000 = $1,050,000

**Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be $1,050,000.**

"Let's break down the problem. Cecilia needs to feed her puppy a certain amount of dog food daily, and we need to determine how many bags she'll need in a year. 

First, we need to determine the total amount of dog food needed for the puppy's first 180 days.  

* **180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups**

Next, we need to determine the amount of dog food needed for the rest of the puppy's life.  We'll assume the puppy lives for a year. 

* **365 days * 2 cups/day = 730 cups**

Finally, we need to add the two amounts together to find the total amount of dog food needed.

* **180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups**

Now, we need to determine how many bags of dog food are needed to provide this amount of food.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and we need to find the difference in laundry between Raymond and David. 

* **Sarah's Laundry:** Sarah's laundry load is 400 pounds.
* **David's Laundry:**  We know Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, David does 400 pounds / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.
* **Raymond's Laundry:** Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so he does 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.
* **Difference:** The difference in laundry is 200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds.

**Answer:** 100 pounds

"The question presents a classic economic dilemma.  To determine the optimal purchase strategy, we must analyze the cost per unit.  

The cost per flower for the 2-flower package is $0.50, while the cost per flower for the 3-flower package is $0.83.  

To determine the savings, we must compare the cost of purchasing 18 flowers at each price point. 

**Option 1:**  Purchasing 18 flowers at the 2-flower package price would cost $18 * $0.50 = $9.00.

**Option 2:** Purchasing 18 flowers at the 3-flower package price would cost $18 * $0.83 = $14.94.

The difference in cost between the two options is $14.94 - $9.00 = $5.94. 

Therefore, Vincent saves $5.94 by purchasing 18 flowers at the 2-flower package price.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given two individuals, Grace and Alex, and their weights.  We need to find their combined weight.

* **Grace's weight:**  Grace weighs 125 pounds.
* **Alex's weight:** Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight.  

To find Alex's weight, we can use the following equation: 
* Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2 pounds

Substituting Grace's weight into the equation, we get:
* Alex's weight = 4 * 125 pounds - 2 pounds = 500 pounds - 2 pounds = 498 pounds

Finally, to find their combined weight, we simply add their weights:
* Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 pounds + 498 pounds = 623 pounds

Therefore, their combined weight is 623 pounds.

"Let's break down this problem.  We are given that a football team played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost.  To find the number of wins, we need to consider the relationship between the number of wins and losses. 

The key is to understand that the total number of games played is the sum of wins and losses.  We can express this mathematically as:

* **Wins + Losses = Total Games**

We are given that the total number of games is 22.  We also know that the team won 8 more than they lost.  This means we can represent the number of wins as:

* **Wins = Losses + 8**

Now, let's use this information to solve for the number of wins.  We can set up an equation:

* **Wins + Losses = 22**
* **(Losses + 8) + Losses = 22**
* **2Losses + 8 = 22**
* **2Losses = 14**
* **Losses = 7**

Since we know that the number of wins is 8 more than the number of losses, we can calculate the number of wins:

* **Wins = Losses + 8**
* **Wins = 7 + 8**
* **Wins = 15**

"Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% of her current salary each year for the next three years.  

**Here's how to calculate her salary after three more years:**

* **Year 1:**  Sylvie's salary increases by 10% of $600, so she gets $600 * 1.10 = $660.
* **Year 2:** Her salary increases by 10% of $660, so she gets $660 * 1.10 = $726.
* **Year 3:** Her salary increases by 10% of $726, so she gets $726 * 1.10 = $798.60.

**Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years will be $798.60.**

"Let's break down this problem using a simple algebraic approach. 

We know that Marilyn sold 10 times the number of copies Harald sold.  This means we can represent the number of copies Harald sold as 'x'.  

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000.  We can express this as an equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 88,000

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it.  Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies. 


**Answer:** Harald sold 8,000 copies.

"To determine the necessary potato salad quantity, we must first understand the consumption patterns of the attendees.  

* **Adult Consumption:**  Each adult dinosaur consumes 10 pounds of potato salad.
* **Child Consumption:**  Children consume half the amount of adults, meaning they consume 5 pounds per child.
* **Total Consumption:**  We need to calculate the total consumption of both adults and children.

**Calculation:**

* Total adult consumption: 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs
* Total child consumption: 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs
* Total consumption: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

**Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure sufficient food for all attendees.**

"Let's break down this problem.  We're given that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and that Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.  We need to determine Gerald's new time after his diet change.

**Understanding the Relationship:**

The key here is to recognize that the problem is about a relative speed difference.  Lee's speed is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, meaning Gerald's time is a baseline.

**Applying the Information:**

* **Lee's Time:** We know Lee's time is 38 seconds.
* **Lee's Speed:**  We know Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
* **Gerald's Time:**  We need to find Gerald's new time.

**Solving for Gerald's New Time:**

To find Gerald's new time, we need to consider the change in his speed.  We can use the following formula:

* **New Time = Original Time + (Percentage Improvement * Original Time)**

Let's plug in the values:

* **New Time = 38 seconds + (0.1 * 38 seconds)**
* **New Time = 38 seconds + 3.8 seconds**
* **New Time = 41.8 seconds**


**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 41.8 seconds.

* **Cats:**  Since there are two cats for every dog, there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.
* **Rabbits:** The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so we can calculate this as 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 rabbits.
* **Total Pets:**  The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.


Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

"Let's break down the problem logically.  We are given that Henry baked 110 cookies after dropping 5.  We also know that he baked 15 more than he intended.  This means we can set up an equation to solve for the number of cookies he baked originally. 

Let's represent the number of cookies he baked originally as 'x'.  We know that he baked 2x cookies this year, and 15 more than he intended.  

The total number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.  We also know that he dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with 110.  

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.

"Let's break down the problem. Kimo attends classes three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, totaling 3 hours per day.  He also attends classes twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, totaling 4 hours per day.  

To find the total weekly class time, we need to consider the number of days and the duration of each class. 

* **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:** 3 classes * 1 hour/class = 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week
* **Tuesday and Thursday:** 2 classes * 2 hours/class = 4 hours/day * 2 days/week = 8 hours/week
* **Total weekly class time:** 9 hours/week + 8 hours/week = 17 hours/week

Finally, to find the total class time for the entire semester, we multiply the weekly class time by the number of weeks in the semester: 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

"The question presents a straightforward calculation of the total length of baked goods.  We must first convert all measurements to a common unit, in this case, inches.  

* Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Adding these lengths together, we get 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.  

Finally, we convert this to feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

"To determine the total number of fish caught, we must first calculate the number of fish each individual caught. 

* **Anakin:** Caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish.
* **Locsin:** Caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

To calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught, we subtract 5 from Anakin's 10: 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. 

Similarly, to calculate the number of seahorses Locsin caught, we subtract 3 from Anakin's 6: 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses.

Finally, to calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught, we add 2 to Anakin's 3: 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Therefore, the total number of fish caught by both individuals is 10 + 6 + 3 + 5 = 24.

"The question presents a classic economic dilemma.  Jackie faces a choice between two options: doing her taxes herself or hiring an accountant.  

Let's break down the potential financial implications:

* **Option 1: DIY Taxes:**  If Jackie chooses to handle her taxes herself, she will forgo 3 hours of freelance work. This means she will lose $35 per hour in potential income. 
* **Option 2: Hiring an Accountant:**  An accountant charges a fee of $90.

To determine the financial impact of each option, we need to consider the potential loss of income from freelance work versus the cost of hiring an accountant. 

**The key is to analyze the net gain or loss.**  

**In this case, the accountant's fee ($90) is a fixed cost.  The question asks for the difference in earnings, not the total cost.** 

**Therefore, the answer is that Jackie will lose $90 if she hires the accountant.**

"Let's break down this problem using the principles of algebraic representation. 

We are given two variables, S representing Seth's current age and B representing Brooke's current age.  We are told that S is twice Brooke's age, meaning S = 2B.  We are also told that in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28.  

This translates to the equation: S + B + 2 = 28.

Now, we can substitute the value of S from the first equation into the second equation:

2B + B + 2 = 28

Combining like terms, we get: 3B + 2 = 28

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have: 3B = 26

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find: B = 8.67 (approximately).

Since we know that S = 2B, we can substitute the value of B to find Seth's age: S = 2 * 8.67 = 17.34 (approximately).

Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.

"Let's analyze Zaid's financial situation.  

We need to determine the amount of money Zaid has left after various expenses and donations. 

* **Rent:** Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 6000$ * (1/4) = 1500$.
* **Car Fuel:** He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 6000$ * (1/3) = 2000$.
* **Total Expenses:**  His total expenses are 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$.
* **Money Remaining:**  After covering his expenses, he has 6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$.
* **Charity Donation:**  He donates half of his remaining money to charity, which is 2500$ / 2 = 1250$.
* **Money After Charity:**  After the donation, he has 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$.
* **Total Given to Daughter and Wife:**  He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, totaling 200$ + 700$ = 900$.

"The question presents a scenario involving a relay race.  To determine the winning margin, we need to analyze the time each team takes to complete their respective legs. 

The first team, consistently performing at a 55-second pace, will have a clear advantage.  The second team's performance, however, presents a more complex scenario.  

The time for each runner on the second team is determined by a pattern: the time of the first runner is 60 seconds, the second runner is 3 seconds faster, the third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second, and the fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third.  

To determine the winning margin, we need to calculate the total time for the second team.  

The total time for the second team is 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds. 

The total time for the first team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds. 

The difference in time is 258 - 220 = 38 seconds.

"The question asks for the relative likelihood of an event, specifically the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 versus rolling two even numbers in a row.  

To analyze this, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each event.  

* **Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3** 
   * There are three numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6.
   * The probability of this event is 3/6 = 1/2, or 50%.

* **Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row**
   * There are three even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6.
   * The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.
   * The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.
   * The probability of this event is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4, or 25%.

To determine the difference in likelihood, we subtract the probability of the second event from the probability of the first event:

50% - 25% = 25%

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"The problem presents a scenario involving the distribution of straw among rodents.  We need to determine the number of rats in each cage. 

Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate the total straw used with hamsters:** We know there are 10 cages of hamsters, each receiving 5 pieces of straw, totaling 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw used with rats:** We know 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents, and 50 pieces were used with hamsters, leaving 160 - 50 = 110 pieces for the rats.

3. **Calculate the number of rats:**  We divide the remaining straw by the number of pieces per rat, which is 6 pieces per rat, to find the number of rats: 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats.

4. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**  We divide the total number of rats by the number of cages to find the number of rats per cage: 18.33 rats / 3 cages = 6.11 rats/cage.

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"The problem presents a classic scenario involving cost, revenue, and profit.  To determine the number of bags sold, we need to consider the trader's expenses and the profit they made. 

Let's break it down:

* **Cost:** The trader purchased the wheat for $20 per bag, and we need to determine the total cost of the bags purchased.
* **Revenue:** The trader sold the wheat for $30 per bag, and we need to determine the total revenue generated from the sales.
* **Profit:** The trader made a profit of $400 after selling all the bags.

We can express this information mathematically:

* **Total Cost:** 20x (where 'x' represents the number of bags)
* **Total Revenue:** 30x (where 'x' represents the number of bags)
* **Total Expenses:** 22x (where 'x' represents the number of bags)

The profit is calculated as:

* **Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses**

We know the profit is $400.  We can now set up an equation to solve for 'x':

* $400 = 30x - 22x

Solving for 'x', we get:

* $400 = 8x
* x = $400 / 8
* x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold **50** bags.

"Let's break down the financial transaction to determine the cost per person. 

First, we need to determine the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides.  The cost of the tickets is $20.25.  The cost of the food is $15.75 less than the tickets, so the cost of the food is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.  The cost of the two rides is $33 each, totaling $33 * 2 = $66.  

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the ticket cost, food cost, and ride cost, which is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.00.

Finally, to determine the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of people, which is 3.  Therefore, each person paid $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

"Let's break down the problem:

Tom's annual tree planting and chopping activities can be analyzed through a series of calculations.  

* **Initial Trees:** Tom begins with 50 trees.
* **Annual Planting:** He plants 10 trees each year, resulting in a total of 100 trees over 10 years.
* **Annual Chopping:** He chops down 2 trees each year, leading to a net loss of 20 trees over 10 years.
* **Net Growth:**  The net growth is 100 trees - 20 trees = 80 trees.
* **Tree Mortality:**  A 30% mortality rate means that 30% of the trees will die. 

**Therefore, after 10 years, Tom will have 91 trees remaining.**

"The question presents a simple supply and demand scenario.  We are given a total of 200 pounds of carrots and a distribution plan of 2 pounds per restaurant.  To determine the amount of carrots not used, we must first calculate the total amount of carrots allocated to the restaurants.  This is achieved by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots per restaurant.  The result is 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds.  Subtracting this from the total amount of carrots, we find that 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds of carrots will not be used. 


**Answer:** 120 pounds

"Let's break down the problem. Elaine's Pokemon card collection is a matter of simple arithmetic. 

* **Month 1:** She starts with 20 cards and adds three times that amount, resulting in 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:** She then collects 20 fewer cards than in month 1, so she has 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Month 1 & 2 combined:**  Her total for the first two months is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.
* **Month 3:**  She collects twice the number from the first two months, which is 100 * 2 = 200 cards.
* **Total:**  Adding all the cards together, Elaine has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"To determine Brinley's required score, we need to understand the legal implications of this scenario.  

The question presents a situation that could be interpreted as a contract or a legal obligation.  Mr. Bert's policy of removing the lowest score from the average is a form of ""contractual modification"" of the original grading system.  

However, the legal framework surrounding this situation is complex and depends on several factors, including:

* **The specific language of the contract:**  Is there a written contract between Mr. Bert and his students outlining the grading policy?
* **State laws:**  Do state laws regulate grading policies and the removal of lowest scores?
* **The nature of the relationship:** Is this a formal educational institution or a private tutoring arrangement?

**Therefore, without a clear legal framework, it is impossible to definitively determine Brinley's required score.**

"The question presents a scenario involving the accumulation of distance traveled by an individual over a period of time.  To determine the total distance, we must consider the distance traveled in each phase of the activity. 

First, we need to calculate the total distance traveled during the initial four-week period.  The individual rode their bike 5 times per week at a distance of 25 kilometers each time, resulting in a total of 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers.  

Next, we need to calculate the distance traveled during the subsequent three-week period. The individual rode their bike 2 times per week at a distance of 60 kilometers each time, resulting in a total of 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers.

Finally, we add the distances from both periods to find the total distance traveled. 125 kilometers + 120 kilometers = 245 kilometers.

"The question presents a straightforward calculation of the total weight of Joe's candy bag.  

To determine the total weight, we must first determine the weight of a single candied apple and then calculate the total weight of the candied apples and the chocolate bars. 

* **Weight of a candied apple:**  The problem states that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, and a chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Therefore, a candied apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.
* **Total weight of candied apples:** Joe has 80 candied apples, and each weighs 20 grams, so the total weight is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.
* **Total weight of chocolate bars:** Joe has 25 chocolate bars, and each weighs 40 grams, so the total weight is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams.
* **Total weight of the bag:** The total weight of the bag is 1600 grams + 1000 grams = 2600 grams.

"Let's break down this problem.  We're asked to determine the cost per cup.  

First, we need to understand the relationship between the cost of cups and plates.  The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.  

To find the cost per cup, we need to isolate the cost of a single cup.  

**Here's how to approach the problem:**

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**  The cost of a dozen is $6000, so half a dozen is $6000 / 2 = $3000.

2. **Calculate the cost of twenty dozen cups:** The problem states that the cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.  Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups is $3000 - $1200 = $1800.

3. **Calculate the cost per cup:**  We know the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1800.  To find the cost per cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups: $1800 / 240 = $7.50.


**Therefore, the cost per cup is $7.50.**

"The problem presents a logical inconsistency.  The scenario states that Jerry collects 42 eggs daily, and the number of red and white chickens combined is the source of those eggs.  

To determine the number of red chickens, we need to consider the total number of eggs produced by the chickens.  

**Here's a breakdown of the problem:**

* **Eggs from Red Chickens:** 3 eggs per day per red chicken.
* **Eggs from White Chickens:** 5 eggs per day per white chicken.
* **Total Eggs:** 42 eggs per day.

**To solve for the number of red chickens, we need to consider the following:**

* **Equation 1:** 3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs)
* **Equation 2:** r = w + 2 (number of red chickens is two more than white chickens)

**Solving for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

1. **Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:** 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
2. **Simplify and solve for 'w':** 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
                                          8w + 6 = 42
                                          8w = 36
                                          w = 4.5

**The problem is flawed because we cannot have half a chicken. This indicates that the problem statement is inconsistent and cannot be solved as written.**

"The question presents a straightforward application of basic geometry and linear motion.  To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to consider the distance he covers and his walking speed. 

The perimeter of the park, being the total length of its boundary, is calculated as 2 * (length + width).  In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Therefore, the perimeter is 15 miles.

Given that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, we can calculate the time he spends walking by dividing the distance by his speed.  This results in 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours. 


**Answer:** 5 hours

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to consider the total number of customers she counted in the first two days.  

The total number of customers Sloane counted in the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250. 

Subtracting this from the total number of customers counted on the third day, we find that Sloane counted 500 - 250 = 250 customers on the third day. 


**Answer:** 250

"The problem presents a logical inconsistency.  Let's break down the scenario:

* **Initial State:** The problem states that the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago. This implies a starting point where the big pool had twice the volume of the small pool. 
* **Water Loss:**  The problem states that both pools lose 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes. This is a consistent rate of water loss.
* **Current State:** The problem states that the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool. This implies a change in the water volume of the pools.

**The Problem:** The problem states that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool. This is a contradiction to the initial state. 

**Conclusion:** The problem is flawed and cannot be solved as presented.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given the ages of three individuals: Adrian, Harriet, and Zack.  We are asked to calculate the average age of these individuals in three years, given Harriet's current age.

**Understanding the Relationships:**

* We know that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
* We also know that Harriet's age is half of Zack's age.

**Solving for the Ages:**

To find the average age in three years, we need to know the ages of each individual in three years.  

**Calculating the Average:**

The average age is calculated by summing the ages of all individuals and dividing by the total number of individuals. 

**Important Note:**  The information provided does not include the ages of Adrian and Zack in three years. 


**Answer:**  We cannot calculate the average age in three years without knowing the ages of Adrian and Zack in three years.

"Let's break down the problem to determine Jojo's score. 

We know the total score for four students is 251.  Naomi scored 68 points, Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, and Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi.  

To find Jojo's score, we can use the following equation:

Total Score = Naomi's Score + Yuri's Score + Brianna's Score + Jojo's Score

We can substitute the known scores to find Jojo's score:

251 = 68 + (Yuri's Score) + (Brianna's Score) + Jojo's Score

We know Yuri's score is 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is 34.  We also know Brianna's score is 17 more than Naomi's score, which is 68.  

Substituting these values into the equation:

251 = 68 + (34 + 10) + (68 + 17) + Jojo's Score

Simplifying the equation:

251 = 68 + 44 + 85 + Jojo's Score

251 = 207 + Jojo's Score

Solving for Jojo's score:

Jojo's Score = 251 - 207

Jojo's Score = 44

"The client, Mark, incurs a significant expense in acquiring his fleet of vehicles.  First, he must account for the purchase price of the cars themselves.  The cost of the 12 cars is $240,000.  Next, he must factor in the applicable sales tax.  The tax rate is 10%, meaning he pays $24,000 in taxes on the total purchase price.  Finally, he incurs an additional $1,000 in registration fees for each of the 12 cars, totaling $12,000.  

Therefore, the total cost of the fleet is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"Let's break down this problem logically.  We are given two aquariums, one with 4 snails and another with 32 snails.  The difference between these numbers is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  

To solve this, we need to consider the following:

* **Snails:** The difference in snails is represented by 32 - 4 = 28.
* **Fish:**  We need to find the number of fish in each aquarium.

The key is to understand that the difference in snails is directly related to the number of fish.  Let's represent the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'.  

The problem states that the difference in snails is twice the number of fish.  This translates to the following equation:

28 = 2 * x

Solving for 'x', we get:

x = 28 / 2
x = 14

Therefore, each aquarium has **14** fish.

The weight of the redwood is calculated by multiplying the weight of a single section by the number of sections in the tree. 

The weight of the wood eaten by termites is a percentage of the total weight of the redwood.  

Therefore, the weight of the redwood is 80,000 pounds.

"Nancy's total bill is $6.00.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **Overdue Book Fees:**  She owes $0.50 per book for a total of 8 books, resulting in $4.00 in fees.
* **Late Fee:**  The library charges a flat fee of $2.00 for books that are overdue for more than a week.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total number of fruits.

* **Andrea's Apples:** We know Andrea has 52 apples.
* **Jamal's Apples:**  Jamal has 44 apples (Andrea has 8 more than Jamal).
* **Jamal's Bananas:** Jamal has 48 bananas (4 more than his apples).

To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of apples and bananas for both individuals. 

**Therefore, there are 100 fruits in total.**

"To determine the total flour needed, we must first determine the number of dozen cookies Carla will bake.  She will bake 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, totaling 66 cookies.  Since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, we can calculate the total flour needed by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per dozen.  This gives us 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens.  Therefore, Carla will need 5.5 dozens * 2 cups per dozen = 11 cups of flour. 


**Answer:** 11

"The question asks for the total dollar amount in a stack of pennies.  To determine this, we need to know the value of one penny.  A penny is worth $0.01.  

We are given that there are 9,300 pennies in a cup.  To find the total dollar amount in a stack containing two-thirds of those pennies, we need to calculate the number of pennies in the stack and then multiply that by the value of one penny. 

The number of pennies in the stack is (2/3) * 9,300 = 6,200.

The total dollar amount in the stack is 6,200 pennies * $0.01/penny = $62.00.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the difference in trees between Harry and Ferdinand's yards.

* **Ferdinand's Trees:**  Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has, meaning he has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
* **Harry's Trees:** Harry has 5 more trees than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has.  This translates to 6 * 2 + 5 = 17 trees.
* **The Difference:**  To find the difference between Harry's and Ferdinand's trees, we subtract Ferdinand's trees from Harry's trees: 17 - 3 = 14.

**Answer:** Harry has 14 more trees than Ferdinand.

"To determine the total amount of money the three girls have combined, we need to consider the individual amounts each possesses. 

* **Carmen:**  We are given Carmen's initial amount of $100.
* **Samantha:**  Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so her amount is $100 + $25 = $125.
* **Daisy:**  Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, making her total $125 + $50 = $175.

Finally, to find the combined total, we add the amounts of each girl: $100 + $125 + $175 = $300. 

Therefore, the total amount of money the three girls have combined is $300.

"Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house are the amount he receives after accounting for transfer fees and brokerage fees.  

To calculate this, we need to consider the following:

1. **Transfer fees:** These are typically a percentage of the sale price and are paid to the parties involved in the transfer of ownership. 
2. **Brokerage fees:** These are fees charged by a real estate agent for their services in facilitating the sale.

**Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds are the sale price of the house minus the total cost of transfer and brokerage fees.**

**Answer:** $100,000

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given a series of time intervals related to heating oil.  

* **Heating to 300 degrees:**  The initial heating time is 20 minutes.
* **Heating to 400 degrees:** The time to reach 400 degrees is 20 minutes * 1.40 = 28 minutes.
* **Cooking:** The time to cook the oil is 23 minutes less than the time to heat to 400 degrees.

To find the total time, we add the times for each step: 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Bag 1:** Mary has 300 M&Ms.
* **Bag 2:**  The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.
* **Bag 3:** The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.
* **Total:** Mary has 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.

Therefore, Mary has a total of 762 M&Ms.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given the total number of stitches for the entire sweater, the number of stitches for the collar, and the number of stitches for the rosette.  We can use this information to determine the number of stitches for each sleeve. 

The total number of stitches is 1800.  The collar takes 90 stitches and the rosette takes twice that amount, so we know the total for the collar and rosette is 90 + (90 * 2) = 270 stitches.  Subtracting this from the total number of stitches gives us 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches for the sleeves.  Finally, we divide the number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find that each sleeve takes 1530 / 2 = 765 stitches.

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the number of cards that have the letter 'D' on them.

* **Step 1:**  We know Carly had 80 cards. 
* **Step 2:** 2/5 of the cards had the letter 'A', leaving 32 cards with 'A'.
* **Step 3:**  The remaining cards after removing the 'A' cards are 48.
* **Step 4:** 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter 'B', which is 24 cards.
* **Step 5:**  After removing the 'B' cards, there are 24 cards left.
* **Step 6:** 5/8 of the remaining cards have the letter 'C', which is 15 cards.
* **Step 7:**  The final step is to calculate the number of cards with 'D'.  

Therefore, the number of cards with 'D' is 24 - 15 = **9**.

"The question presents a straightforward calculation of time.  To determine the total time required, we must consider the time spent on each type of hole separately. 

First, we need to determine the time spent on each type of hole.  The time to dig a small hole is 3 minutes, and the time to dig a large hole is 10 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time spent on the small holes.  We know that it takes 3 minutes per small hole and we are digging 30 small holes.  Therefore, the total time for the small holes is 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Similarly, we need to calculate the total time spent on the large holes.  We know that it takes 10 minutes per large hole and we are digging 15 large holes.  Therefore, the total time for the large holes is 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Finally, we need to add the time spent on the small holes and the time spent on the large holes to find the total time.  The total time is 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide the total time in minutes by 60 minutes per hour.  Therefore, the total time is 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

"The question presents a straightforward scenario.  To determine the sum of their ages in ten years, we need to consider the current ages of Mico and Marco and then apply the concept of age progression. 

**The key is to understand that the sum of their ages is a static value, and the question asks for a future value.  Therefore, the sum of their ages in ten years will be the sum of their current ages plus ten years.**

**Answer:** 40

"Let's analyze the given information. We are presented with two statements:

* **Statement 1:** Ruby is six times older than Sam.
* **Statement 2:** In nine years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam.

We need to determine Sam's current age.

**Let's represent Sam's current age as ""S"" and Ruby's current age as ""R"".**

From Statement 1, we know: 
* R = 6S

From Statement 2, we know:
* R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now we can substitute the value of R from Statement 1 into Statement 2:
* 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Simplifying the equation:
* 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
* 3S = 18
* S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently **6 years old**. 


**Answer: 6**

"The question presents a simple economic transaction.  To determine the total cost, we must add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars. 

* **Popsicle cost:** 20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00
* **Ice cream bar cost:** 4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00
* **Total cost:** $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the total cost of the purchase is $7.00.

"To determine the answer, we need to consider the relationship between the number of cobras and mambas and the total number of spots.  

Let's break it down:

* **Cobras:**  We know there are 40 cobras.
* **Mambas:** We know there are 60 mambas.
* **Total Spots:**  The total number of spots is the sum of the spots on each snake type. 

**Calculation:**

* **Cobras:** 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra = 2800 spots
* **Mambas:** 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots
* **Total Spots:** 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots

**Answer:** Half the total number of spots is 4900 / 2 = 2450.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the cost of Maddy's pizza purchase. 

First, we need to determine the total number of people attending the event.  The team has 12 members, and there are 3 coaches, totaling 12 + 3 = 15 individuals.  Each individual brings 2 guests, so there are 15 individuals * 2 guests/individual = 30 guests.

Next, we need to determine the total number of people Maddy needs to feed.  The total number of people is 30 guests + 3 coaches = 33 people.

Finally, we need to determine the number of pizzas needed.  Each pizza serves 3 people, so Maddy needs 33 people / 3 people/pizza = 11 pizzas.

The total cost of the pizzas is 11 pizzas * $15/pizza = $165.

**Answer:** $165

"The question presents a straightforward application of basic geometry and proportion.  We are asked to determine the number of silver beads used in a necklace. 

* **Topaz Length:** The topaz gemstones are 1 inch each.
* **Space Between:** The space between the gemstones is 17 inches.
* **Bead Length:** Each bead is 0.25 inches long.

To find the number of beads, we can divide the total length of the space between the gemstones by the length of each bead: 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.

**Therefore, Katerina uses 68 silver beads per necklace.**

"The question presents a straightforward scenario involving the accumulation of stories written by three siblings.  To determine the total number of stories written, we need to consider the increase in stories each sibling wrote in the second week. 

Let's break it down:

* **Alani:**  She doubled her initial 20 stories, resulting in 20 * 2 = 40 stories.
* **Braylen:** He doubled his initial 40 stories, resulting in 40 * 2 = 80 stories.
* **Margot:** She doubled her initial 60 stories, resulting in 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Adding the stories from each sibling, we get 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories. 

Therefore, the total number of stories written by the three siblings in the second week is 240.

"The question presents a simple financial calculation.  To determine the remaining amount of money after purchasing a can of pop, we must first determine the total value of the coins Kelly possesses.  

Kelly possesses five quarters, each worth 25 cents, totaling 5 * 25 = 125 cents.  Additionally, she has two dimes, each worth 10 cents, totaling 2 * 10 = 20 cents.  

The total value of her coins is 125 + 20 = 145 cents.  Subtracting the cost of the pop, which is 55 cents, leaves Kelly with 145 - 55 = 90 cents. 


**Answer:** 90

"Let's break down the problem:

The flag has a total of 76 stars.  We know it has three rows of 8 stars, and two rows of 6 stars.  This gives us a total of 24 stars from the first two rows.  

The remaining stars are distributed in the third row.  We can calculate the number of 5-star rows by subtracting the number of stars in the first two rows from the total number of stars.  This gives us 52 stars.  

Finally, we divide the number of stars in the third row by the number of stars per row to determine the number of 5-star rows.  This gives us 5.6 rows.  

Since you can't have a fraction of a row, there must be **5** rows of 5 stars. 



**Answer:** 5

"To determine the number of trucks needed for this delivery, we must first determine the total weight of the flagstones.  

The question states that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and the delivery requires 80 flagstones.  Therefore, the total weight of the flagstones is 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 5,000 pounds.

Next, we need to consider the capacity of the delivery trucks. Each truck can carry 2,000 pounds.  

To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck: 5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks.

Since we cannot have half a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, **3 trucks** are required to transport the flagstones. 


 
"
"The question presents a scenario involving two cars traveling at different speeds.  To determine the time taken by the slower car to cover the same distance, we need to consider the relationship between speed, distance, and time. 

The fundamental principle is that distance is directly proportional to speed and time.  

* **Speed:** The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour.
* **Distance:** The car in the fast lane travels 480 miles.
* **Time:** We need to find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance.

We can use the following formula:

**Distance = Speed x Time**

Let's denote the time taken by the car in the slow lane as 't'.  We can set up the equation:

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we get:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

**Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance.**

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  

We know Ali and Izzy have a combined total of 39 medals.  We also know that they represent a fraction of the total medals given out.  To find the total number of medals given out, we need to determine the total number of medals Ali and Izzy represent as a fraction of the total medals. 

Let's represent the total number of medals given out as ""x"".  We can then set up an equation:

* Ali and Izzy's medals represent 39/x of the total medals.

We know that Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 17 medals.  We can use this information to find the value of x. 

**Therefore, the total number of medals given out is x.**

Therefore, each child will receive 5 chocolate bars.

"Let's break down the problem. Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work.  We need to determine her earnings within a specific time frame. 

First, we need to determine the total time Susan works.  She works from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, which is 3 hours.  

Next, we need to consider her breaks. She takes a half-hour break, which is 30 minutes. 

Finally, we need to calculate her earnings. 

**Answer:** 15 dollars

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the total points after the extra points are awarded in the fourth round. 

* **Mike:**  Mike starts with 21 points.
* **Jim:** Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so he has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
* **Tony:** Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

**Round 4:**  
* Mike: 21 points + 1 point = 22 points
* Jim: 18 points + 1 point = 19 points
* Tony: 42 points + 1 point = 43 points

**Total points:** 22 + 19 + 43 = 84 points 


**Answer:** 84

"The question presents a straightforward scenario with a simple arithmetic solution.  

To determine the number of oranges left unwashed, we must first determine the number of oranges the sons can wash.  The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half his age, meaning the youngest son is 4 years old.  The total number of oranges the sons can wash is 8 + 4 = 12.  Subtracting the number of oranges the sons can wash from the total number of oranges Will bought, we find that 15 - 12 = 3 oranges remain unwashed. 


**Answer:** 3

"Let's break down the problem. Darren's exercise regimen can be analyzed through a lens of simple addition and multiplication.  

* **Day 1:** He performs 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses.
* **Day 2:** He increases his pushups by 20, decreases his squats by 10, and doubles his dumbbell presses.

To calculate the total number of activities performed over the two days, we need to add the results of each day. 

**Total Activities:**

* **Day 1:** 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

"The question presents a straightforward application of basic arithmetic.  To determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption and then divide the total weight of the bag by the daily consumption. 

**Answer:** 3 weeks

"To determine the discrepancy between Sam's sales and his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates sold and then compare it to his target. 

First, we need to consider the sales for the week. Sam sold 20 crates on the weekend, 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday.  

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates sold.

Finally, we can determine the difference between his total sales and his target. Sam sold 65 crates, while his target was 120 crates.  

Therefore, Sam was **55** crates short of his target.

"The auction process is a bit of a legal puzzle, but let's break it down.  

The initial bid of $200 establishes a baseline.  Each subsequent bid is a separate action, and the bidding increments are a key factor.  

The question asks for the final cost, which is the sum of all the bids made. 

**Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $400.**

"The client's annual cost for driving can be determined by calculating the total mileage driven and the associated cost per mile, as well as the monthly bonus. 

First, we need to determine the total mileage driven per year. The client travels 30 miles to work each day, five days a week, for 52 weeks, resulting in a total of 30 miles/day * 5 days/week * 52 weeks/year = 7,800 miles.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the driving service. The client is charged $2 per mile, so the total cost for the year is 7,800 miles * $2/mile = $15,600.

Finally, the client receives a monthly bonus of $150.  The total cost for the year is $15,600 + $150 * 12 = $15,600 + $1,800 = $17,400.

"Annika's initial expenditure of $50 can be broken down into two parts: the cost of food and snacks, and the cost of rides.  

To determine the amount remaining, we must first calculate the total cost of the food and snacks.  Half of her initial $50 is $50 / 2 = $25.  

Next, we add the cost of the rides, which is $10.  The total cost of her spending is $25 + $10 = $35.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount to find the amount remaining.  This gives us $50 - $35 = $15. 

Therefore, Annika has $15 remaining.

"To determine Watson's earnings for April, we need to consider his weekly earnings and the bonus he receives.  

Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week, earning $10 per hour.  His weekly earnings are calculated as follows:

* **Daily earnings:** 10 hours/day * $10/hour = $100/day
* **Weekly earnings:** $100/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

Additionally, he receives a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.

Therefore, Watson's total earnings for April would be his weekly earnings plus the bonus, assuming the company performed well for the entire month.

"The question presents a scenario involving a hypothetical serum with a specific growth effect.  To determine the total number of limbs resulting from the serum's application, we need to consider the rate of limb growth. 

The serum's effect is as follows:

* **Arms:**  The serum adds an arm every 3 days.
* **Legs:** The serum adds a leg every 5 days.

To calculate the total number of limbs, we need to consider the number of days the serum is applied and the growth rate for each limb type. 

**Therefore, after 15 days, the serum will cause a person to grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs, resulting in a total of 8 new limbs.**

"The question presents a straightforward financial calculation.  

To determine the amount Theo has left for gifts, we need to first calculate the total cost of his business trip expenses.  

* **Business Suit Expenses:** 6 suits at $100 each = $600
* **Suitcase Expenses:** 3 suitcases at $50 each = $150
* **Flight Ticket:**  The cost of the flight is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a suit, so we need to calculate that: 5 * $100 = $500, and $700 more than that is $500 + $700 = $1200.
* **Total Expenses:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350

Finally, we subtract the total expenses from his initial budget: $6000 - $2350 = $3650.  

Therefore, Theo has $3650 remaining to spend on gifts.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach. 

We know the total number of players on the football team is 105.  We are given that the offense has twice the number of players as the defense.  This means we can represent the number of players on the defense as 'x'.  

The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so we can represent the number of players on the offense as 2x.

Finally, we know there are half the number of players on the special teams as the defense. This means the number of players on special teams is x/2.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of players:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

(7/2)x = 105

To isolate x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (7/2), which is (2/7):

x = 105 * (2/7)

Simplifying the equation:

x = 30

Therefore, there are **30** players on the defense.

The number of people with prior commitments is 2, representing 1/4 of the total number of people who were initially invited.  

Therefore, the number of attendees at Martha's party is 24 - 2 = 22.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that initially, there were 25 men and 15 women at a party.  After one hour, a portion of the attendees departed.  We are asked to determine the number of women remaining after this departure.

The key to this problem is understanding the nature of the departure.  The question states that ""1/4 of the total number of people left."" This implies a proportional reduction in the total number of attendees.

To find the number of women remaining, we need to consider the initial number of women and the number of people who left.  

**Therefore, the number of women remaining is 15 - (1/4 * 15) = 15 - 3.75 = 11.25**

**However, we cannot have a fraction of a person. This suggests that there may be an error in the problem statement.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the total amount of money the company pays to all its programmers. 

First, we need to determine the number of junior programmers.  The company has 100 employees, and junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total.  This means there are 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.

Next, we need to calculate the salary of each junior programmer. They are paid $2000 per month.

Now, we need to calculate the salary of a senior programmer. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.  Therefore, a senior programmer earns $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

Finally, we need to calculate the total salary of all programmers.  We know there are 40 junior programmers and 60 senior programmers.  The total salary of all programmers is 40 * $2000 + 60 * $2400 = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Let's analyze the two job offers to determine which provides Nick with the greater net income.

**Job A:**

* **Hourly Rate:** $15 per hour
* **Hours Worked:** 2000 hours per year
* **Tax Rate:** 20%

**Job B:**

* **Annual Salary:** $42,000
* **Property Tax:** $6,000
* **Tax Rate:** 10% on net income after property tax

**Calculating Net Income for Job A:**

* **Gross Pay:** $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* **Tax:** $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
* **Net Pay:** $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Calculating Net Income for Job B:**

* **Net Income After Property Tax:** $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
* **Tax:** $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
* **Net Pay:** $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

**Determining the Difference in Net Pay:**

* **Difference:** $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

**Conclusion:**

Job B offers Nick a higher net income of $8,400 compared to Job A.

"The value of Maria's shares can be determined by considering the fluctuations in price over the two years.  

**First Year:** Maria's initial investment of 8 shares at $8 per share results in a total investment of $64.  A 50% increase in the stock price means the value of her shares increases by 50% of $64, which is $32.  Therefore, the value of her shares at the end of the first year is $64 + $32 = $96.

**Second Year:** The stock price then experiences a 25% decrease.  This means the value of her shares decreases by 25% of $96, which is $24.  The final value of her shares is $96 - $24 = $72.

"The problem presents a classic scenario involving a simple arithmetic sequence.  We can break it down as follows:

* **Equal Groups:** The problem states that the class is divided into three groups, and two of these groups are equal in size. 
* **Smallest Group:** The final group is 10 less than each of the other two groups. 

Let's denote the number of students in each of the equal groups as 'x'.  The number of students in the smallest group is then 'x - 10'.

The total number of students in the class is the sum of the students in all three groups.  We can express this mathematically as:

* 2x + (x - 10) = 200

Solving for 'x', we get:

* 3x - 10 = 200
* 3x = 210
* x = 70

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = **60**.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  

We are given that Farmer Brown has a total of 60 animals, and they are either chickens or cows.  We are also told that the number of chickens is twice the number of cows.  

To solve this, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of chickens as 'c' and the number of cows as 'w'.

* **Equation 1:** c + w = 60 (The total number of animals)
* **Equation 2:** c = 2w (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

Now, we can solve for 'c' using Equation 2:

* c = 2w
* Substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 1: 2w + w = 60
* Combine like terms: 3w = 60
* Solve for 'w': w = 20 
* Substitute the value of 'w' back into Equation 2 to find 'c': c = 2 * 20 = 40

Finally, we can calculate the total number of legs:

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so there are 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so there are 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.
* The total number of legs is 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs.


**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

* **The Drop:**  He drops 3 balls, leaving him with 5 - 3 = 2 balls.
* **Lost Ball:** One ball is lost, leaving him with 2 - 1 = 1 ball.

**Therefore, Josh has 1 ball remaining.**

"The question presents a simple application of a percentage discount.  

To determine the final price, we need to first calculate the discount amount.  The discount is 40% of the original price of each shirt, which is $30.  

Next, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price. 

Therefore, the final price for the two shirts is $30 * 2 - $24 = $60 - $24 = $36.

"The question presents a scenario involving a change in production and revenue.  To determine the percentage increase in earnings, we need to compare the current daily earnings to the previous daily earnings. 

**Here's how we can analyze the situation:**

* **Current Daily Earnings:** The factory now earns $1100 per day from selling silos.
* **Previous Daily Earnings:** The factory previously earned $1000 per day from selling tractors.

**Calculating the Percentage Increase:**

1. **Calculate the difference in earnings:** $1100 - $1000 = $100
2. **Divide the difference by the original earnings:** $100 / $1000 = 0.10
3. **Multiply by 100 to express the result as a percentage:** 0.10 * 100% = 10%

**Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.**

"The question presents a straightforward financial calculation.  To determine Madeline's annual expenditure on her dog, we must first calculate her monthly expenses. 

* **Food:** $25 per week * 4 weeks/month = $100 per month
* **Treats:** $20 per month
* **Medicine:** $100 per month

Adding these costs together, we get a monthly total of $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Finally, we multiply this monthly cost by 12 to find her annual expenditure: $220/month * 12 months/year = $2640.

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 annually on her dog.

"Let's analyze Peyton's schedule.  

* **Monday:** 1 hour yoga
* **Tuesday:** 3 hours yoga (three times the duration of Monday's class)
* **Wednesday:** 0.5 hours cheese-tasting
* **Thursday:** 0.167 hours museum tour (half the duration of Tuesday's class)
* **Friday:** 2 hours errands

To calculate the total time, we sum the durations of each activity: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 0.167 + 2 = 6.667 hours. 

**Therefore, the total time for all of Peyton's after-work activities is 6.667 hours.**

"Let's break down the problem. We are given information about the heights of three trees in Eddy's backyard.  

* **Tree 1:** 6 feet
* **Tree 2:** 5 feet taller than Tree 1, so 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet
* **Tree 3:** Twice the combined height of the first two trees.

To find the height of Tree 3, we need to calculate the combined height of the first two trees and then multiply that by 2. 

The combined height of the first two trees is 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet. 

Therefore, Tree 3 is 17 feet * 2 = 34 feet tall.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the number of friends Morgan can invite. 

We need to consider the total cost of the activities and ensure it doesn't exceed her $90 budget. 

* **Mini-golf:**  The cost per round of mini-golf is $5.  
* **Go-karts:** Each ride costs $10. 

To find the total cost, we need to consider the cost of mini-golf and the cost of the go-karts. 

**Let's represent the number of friends as ""x"".**

* **Mini-golf cost:** 5 * x 
* **Go-kart cost:** 10 * 2 = $20 (since she wants to ride the go-karts twice)

**Total cost:** 5x + 20

**We know the total cost cannot exceed $90.  Therefore:**

5x + 20 ≤ 90

**Solving for x:**

1. Subtract 20 from both sides: 5x ≤ 70
2. Divide both sides by 5: x ≤ 14

**Therefore, Morgan can invite a maximum of 14 friends.**

"The question presents a scenario involving the operation of a train and its service intervals.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we must first determine the total distance traveled by the train in a day. 

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city.  This means the distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles.

The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

The train travels 225 miles per trip * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.

The question asks for the number of days between service intervals.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles.  The number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

Therefore, the train needs service every 26.67 days.

"The question presents a scenario involving a trip to a friend's house, a detour, and a return journey.  To determine the total time taken, we must consider the time spent on each leg of the journey.

**Step 1: Distance to the Friend's House**

The initial distance to the friend's house is 200 miles.

**Step 2: Time to Reach the Friend's House**

The speed at which John travels to the friend's house is 70 mph.  Therefore, the time taken to reach the destination is calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (approximately)

**Step 3: Detour**

A detour adds 10 miles to the journey, increasing the total distance to 210 miles.

**Step 4: Time for the Detour**

The time taken for the detour is calculated as follows:

Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours (approximately)

**Step 5: Time to Return Home**

The return journey is 240 miles long and John travels at 80 mph.  The time taken to return home is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Step 6: Total Time**

The total time taken for the entire trip is the sum of the time spent on each leg of the journey:

Total Time = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours

**Therefore, the total time taken for the trip is 6.00 hours.**

"Let's analyze the cost breakdown of the senior awards. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames.  Each frame costs $20, and we need to account for an additional 20% etching cost per frame, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4.  Therefore, the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.

"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked, we need to consider the apples sold on each day.  

* **Monday:** Lucy sold 14 apples, earning $56. This means she had 14 apples in her possession on Monday.
* **Tuesday:** Lucy picked 12 more apples, bringing her total to 14 + 12 = 26 apples.
* **Wednesday:** Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so she picked 26 * 2 = 52 apples.

Finally, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the number of apples from each day: 14 + 12 + 52 = 88 apples. 

**Answer:** Lucy picked 88 apples over the three days.

"The question presents a simple loan scenario.  To determine the monthly payment, we need to consider the principal amount, the interest rate, and the loan term. 

**Here's how to calculate the monthly payment:**

* **Principal:** The amount borrowed is $3,650.
* **Interest Rate:** The interest rate is 10% per annum.
* **Loan Term:** The loan term is 5 months.

**To find the monthly payment, we can use the following formula:**

**M = P [ i(1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n – 1]**

Where:

* M = Monthly payment
* P = Principal amount ($3,650)
* i = Monthly interest rate (10% annual interest rate divided by 12 months)
* n = Number of months (5)

**Let's plug in the values:**

M = 3650 [ (0.10/12) (1 + 0.10/12) ^ 5 ] / [ (1 + 0.10/12) ^ 5 – 1]

**Calculating the result, we get:**

M ≈ $3680.42

**Therefore, Karan must pay approximately $3680.42 per month.**

"To determine the total number of pesos Axel and Anna possess, we must first calculate the individual amounts each possesses. 

* **Axel's pesos:** Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos, totaling 50 + 80 = 130 pesos.
* **Anna's pesos:** Anna has twice the number of silver pesos Axel has, which is 50 * 2 = 100 pesos.  Additionally, she has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, meaning she has 80 + 40 = 120 pesos.
* **Total pesos:**  To find the total, we add the individual amounts: 130 + 120 = 250 pesos.

Therefore, the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together is 250.

"Let's break down Millie's lemonade stand operation to determine her profit per hour. 

First, we need to understand the key elements:

* **Cost:** Millie incurs a fixed cost of $18 for supplies.
* **Revenue:** She sells lemonade at $1 per cup.
* **Sales Volume:** She sells 144 cups of lemonade in a given hour.

To calculate her profit per hour, we need to consider the following:

* **Profit = Revenue - Cost**

**Profit = (144 cups * $1/cup) - $18**
**Profit = $144 - $18**
**Profit = $126**

Therefore, Millie makes a profit of $126 per hour.

"To determine the original amount of land Mr. Ruther possessed, we need to consider the remaining land after the sale.  

Let's represent the original amount of land as 'x'.  We know that after selling 3/5 of his land, he was left with 12.8 hectares.  

This can be expressed mathematically as:

(1 - 3/5)x = 12.8

Simplifying the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To find the original amount of land, we can solve for 'x':

x = 12.8 * (5/2)

Therefore, x = 32 hectares.


**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first. 
"
"The question presents a scenario involving a choir and a performance.  To determine the number of individuals who sang, we must first determine the total number of choir members and then consider the number of individuals who were unable to perform.  

The choir has 52 members, and half of them are girls, meaning there are 26 girls.  The remaining half are boys, totaling 26 boys.  The total number of choir members is 52.

The number of people who can't make it to the performance is half of the total number of choir members, which is 26.  

The number of people who sang is the total number of choir members minus the number of people who couldn't make it to the performance.  

Therefore, the number of people who sang is 52 - 26 = 26.

"The question presents a simple supply and demand scenario.  Mark needs to purchase flour and milk for his quadruple batch of brownies.  The question asks for the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk he needs to purchase.  

The key is to recognize that the problem is asking for a difference, not a sum.  Since Mark needs the same number of bags and bottles, the answer is **0**.

"The question presents a straightforward energy consumption scenario.  To determine the energy savings, we must first understand the relationship between kilowatt-hours (kWh) and watt-hours (Wh). 

A kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a unit of energy, representing the amount of energy used by a device over a period of one hour.  A watt-hour (Wh) is a unit of energy used by a device over a period of one hour. 

To convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours, we divide the watt-hours by 1000. 

Therefore, the total energy saved in 30 days is 135 kWh. 


**Answer:** 135 kWh

"To determine the average number of stripes across the zebras, we need to consider the total number of stripes and the number of zebras. 

Let's break it down:

* **Zebra 1 & 2:** 2 zebras * 17 stripes/zebra = 34 stripes
* **Zebra 3:** 36 stripes
* **Total Stripes:** 34 stripes + 36 stripes + 18 stripes = 88 stripes
* **Average Stripes:** 88 stripes / 3 zebras = 29.33 stripes/zebra (approximately)

Therefore, the average number of stripes across the zebras is approximately 29.33.

"The question presents a straightforward economic problem.  To determine the total cost, we must first determine the total quantity of meat and cheese required.  

Tyson needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese to serve 20 people.  The cost of the meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of the cheese is $3.00 per pound.  

Therefore, the total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00. 


**Answer:** $50.00

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Allan has twice as many corn as cannolis.  We also know he has 40 cannolis.  To find the number of corn, we can use the following equation:

* Corn = 2 * Cannolis

We can then substitute the given number of cannolis into the equation:

* Corn = 2 * 40 = 80

Finally, to find the total number of corn and cannolis, we add the number of each:

* Total = Corn + Cannolis
* Total = 80 + 40 = 120

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corn and cannolis Allan has in his house is 120.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Elliott started with 10,000 steps and completed 5,000 of those steps on his way to and from school.  He then took an additional 1,000 steps on a short walk with a friend.  Finally, he had 2,000 steps remaining after his jog. 

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to consider the steps he had left after his walk with his friend. 

**Answer:** 2,000

"Let's break down the problem.  Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and he has a book to read.  

First, we need to determine how long it will take Toby to read the book.  He reads 300 words per minute, and the book has 9000 words.  Therefore, it will take him 30 minutes to read the book.

Next, we need to consider the time it takes to travel to the airport.  It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.

Finally, we need to calculate how much time Toby has left before he needs to be at the airport.  He has 40 minutes left.

Therefore, Toby will be 1.33 minutes early.

"Let's break down the problem to determine Sally's remaining funds. 

First, we need to understand the taffy sale. The offer states ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."" This means she receives a discount of $1.50 for every pound of taffy purchased. 

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the taffy.  She purchased 2 pounds of taffy, and the discount is $1.50 per pound, so the total cost is $4.50.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the seashells and magnets. The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost $1.00. 

Adding the cost of the taffy, seashells, and magnets, we get $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, Sally has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 remaining.

"Let's break down the transaction to determine the total cost. 

First, we need to consider the cost of the two firework packages. The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice that amount, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.  

Next, we need to account for the discount. The total cost before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.  The discount is 20% of this amount, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.  

After the discount, Tim's total cost is $1200 - $240 = $960.  Finally, we need to add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150.  

Therefore, Tim's total spending is $960 + $150 = $1110.

"To determine the number of dozens of cookies Shannon needs, we must first determine the total number of cookies she requires.  She consumes 2 cookies per night for 30 nights, resulting in a total consumption of 2 cookies/night * 30 nights = 60 cookies.  

Since a dozen contains 12 cookies, Shannon needs 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens of cookies. 

Therefore, Shannon needs to make **5** dozens of cookies.

"Let's break down the problem logically.  

We are given that Joanne gathers apples from three different types of trees: tall, short, and average.  We are also given that her sister gathers apples from the same three types of trees.  

We need to find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. 

**Here's how we can approach this:**

1. **Joanne's Apples:** We know Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. 
2. **Sister's Apples:** We know her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
3. **Sister's Apples from Shortest Trees:** We know her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
4. **Total Apples:** The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples. 

**To find the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we can use the following equation:**

Total apples = Joanne's apples + Sister's apples 

**Let's plug in the values we know:**

500 = 30 + 60 + x + 45

**Solving for x:**

500 = 135 + x

x = 500 - 135

x = 365

**Therefore, Joanne gathered 365 apples from the average trees.**

"The problem presents a classic algebraic puzzle.  We can solve for the number of dromedaries by using a system of equations. 

Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We know the following:

* **Heads:** The total number of heads is c + d = 180
* **Bumps:** The total number of bumps is 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'c' in the first equation: c = 180 - d.

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304.

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Let's break down this problem. We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and we need to determine the size of Timothy's locker. 

We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.  Therefore, we can express Peter's locker as 1/4 of Zack's locker.  

We also know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.  We can use this information to find the size of Zack's locker. 

Let's use the following equation:

* Peter's locker = 1/4 * Zack's locker
* 5 cubic inches = 1/4 * Zack's locker

To solve for Zack's locker, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

* 5 cubic inches * 4 = 1/4 * Zack's locker * 4
* 20 cubic inches = Zack's locker

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, we can find Timothy's locker.  We know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. 

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.


**Answer:** Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"Let's analyze the cost of Bill's streaming service subscription. 

* **Introductory Period:** The initial six months cost $8 per month, totaling $8 * 6 = $48.
* **Transitional Period:** The price then increased to $12 per month for the next two months, totaling $12 * 2 = $24.
* **Standard Rate:** The final price is $14 per month for the remaining six months, totaling $14 * 6 = $84.

To calculate the total cost for two years, we need to consider the cost of these three periods. 

**Therefore, the total cost for two years is $48 + $24 + $84 = $156.**

* **The key is to understand the concept of ""original price"" in this context.**  The question states that the jeans were on sale, implying a price reduction.  This price reduction is a legal concept known as a ""sale price.""  

* **The sale price of the tattered jeans is $28.**

* **The sale price of the jogger jeans is $6 less than the tattered jeans, meaning they were originally priced at $28 + $6 = $34.**

* **The difference between the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $34 - $28 = $6.**

"To determine the total number of employees who can join the day trip, we need to consider the capacity of each mode of transportation. 

* **Buses:**  Each bus can accommodate 60 employees. We have 4 buses. Therefore, the total capacity of the buses is 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees.
* **Minibuses:** Each minibus can accommodate 30 employees. We have 6 minibusses. Therefore, the total capacity of the minibusses is 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees.
* **Minivans:** Each minivan can accommodate 15 employees. We have 10 minivans. Therefore, the total capacity of the minivans is 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees.

Adding the capacities of all the vehicles, we get 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.

"Lillian's garden is experiencing a fascinating avian influx!  To determine the total number of birds she can expect, we need to consider the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder. 

Let's break it down:

* **Store-bought feeders:**  Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
* **Homemade feeders:** Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought feeders, meaning they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds.

To find the total number of birds, we need to add the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder: 20 (store-bought) + 30 (homemade) = 50 birds.

**Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 50 birds in her garden each day.**

"Let's break down this problem.  We need to determine the number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with, given his earnings and the price per card. 

Here's how we can approach this:

* **Consider the Goal:** Kenny's goal is to raise enough money to buy a $100 ticket.
* **Determine Earnings:** He plans to sell his cards for $1.50 each.
* **Calculate the Number of Cards:** We need to find the number of cards he needs to sell to reach $100.

**Therefore, we can set up an equation:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of cards Kenny has.
*  The total earnings from selling the cards is 1.5x.
*  We know that 1.5x must equal $100.

**Solving for x:**

*  1.5x = $100
*  x = $100 / 1.5 
*  x = 66.67

**Rounding to the nearest whole number:**

*  Kenny started with approximately 67 cards.

* **Pot and Pans:** $120.00
* **Mixing Bowls:** $20.00
* **Utensils:** $25.00

Adding these together, we get a total cost of $165.00.

Next, we apply the 20% discount.  The discount amount is calculated as follows:

"Let's break down the problem to determine the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce.

* **Prince Arthur's Dragons:**  We know Prince Arthur slew three-quarters of Prince Thaddeus's 100 dragons.  This translates to 100 * (3/4) = 75 dragons.
* **Prince Walter's Dragons:** Prince Walter slew twice the number of dragons as Prince Arthur, meaning he killed 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.
* **Prince Bruce's Dragons:**  Prince Bruce, lacking a sword, slew one-fifth the number of dragons Prince Walter did.  This means he killed 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.

**Therefore, Prince Bruce slain 30 dragons.**

"Let's break down this problem using the principles of basic arithmetic and financial analysis.

We are given that George spent $5.00 and received a remainder of 1% of his initial funds. This suggests that the remaining amount represents a portion of his initial expenditure. 

To determine the number of candy bars purchased, we must first determine the cost of the chips.  

* The cost of the chips is $1.20. 
* The remaining amount after purchasing the chips is $0.05. 

We can then calculate the cost of the candy bars. 

* The cost of the candy bars is $4.95. 

To determine the number of candy bars purchased, we must divide the total cost of the candy bars by the price per candy bar. 

* The number of candy bars purchased is 6.

"The question presents a straightforward application of geometry.  We are given the area of a rectangular room and its length.  We can use the area formula to find the width, and then use the perimeter formula to find the perimeter. 

**Here's how to solve:**

* **Area:**  The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width. We are given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet.  
* **Width:**  Let's denote the width as 'w'.  We can set up the equation: 360 = 9 * w. Solving for 'w', we get w = 360/9 = 40 feet.
* **Perimeter:** The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides.  The perimeter is 2 * (length + width).  Substituting the values we found, the perimeter is 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

**Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.**

"The question presents a straightforward comparison of the number of beads possessed by two sisters.  To determine the difference in the number of beads, we must first calculate the total number of beads each sister possesses. 

Elizabeth has 3 packs of beads, each containing 20 pieces, totaling 3 * 20 = 60 pieces.  

Margareth has 7 packs of beads, each containing 20 pieces, totaling 7 * 20 = 140 pieces.

The difference in the number of beads is 140 - 60 = 80. 

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 


 
"
"The question presents a scenario involving temperature changes and requires us to apply basic arithmetic and logic.  

First, we need to determine the temperature increase due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.  The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, so the total increase is 5 degrees/hour * 180 minutes = 900 degrees.

Next, we need to account for the cooling effect of the window. The window is open for 30 minutes, which is 30/10 = 3 degrees.

Finally, we need to add the temperature increase and the cooling effect to find the final temperature. 

Therefore, the final temperature is 40 degrees + 900 degrees - 3 degrees = 937 degrees. 


**Answer: 937**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Movie C:** We know Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is equal to 75 minutes.
* **Movie B:** Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it's 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes long.
* **Movie A:** Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning it's 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.

**Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.**

"The question presents a straightforward cost-related scenario.  To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we need to consider the following:

* **Original Price:** The initial price per balloon was $45.
* **Price Increase:** The price per balloon increased by $20.
* **New Price:** The new price per balloon is $65.

To calculate the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we use the following formula:

**Cost = Number of Balloons * New Price per Balloon**

Therefore, the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase is:

**170 * $65 = $11050**

"To determine the value of Jenna's jewels, we need to consider the monetary worth of each type of gem and the trade she made. 

First, we know that sapphires are worth $800 each, and she started with 8 of them.  

Next, she traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.  We need to determine the value of the rubies she received.  

Finally, we need to add the value of the rubies to the value of the sapphires to find the total value of her jewels. 


**Answer:** $2000

"To determine the total number of apples consumed by Marin and Nancy over 30 days, we need to consider their individual consumption rates.  Each person eats 4 apples per day.  Therefore, over 30 days, their combined consumption would be:

* **Option A:** 4 apples/day * 30 days = 120 apples

 
**Answer: 120**

"The question presents a straightforward economic calculation.  To determine the total cost, we need to consider the volume of soil required and the price per bag. 

First, we need to determine the volume of soil needed for all the beds. Each bed has a volume of 32 cubic feet. Since Bob has 10 beds, the total volume of soil needed is 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the number of bags required to fill the beds. Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so we divide the total volume needed by the volume per bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost. Each bag costs $12, and Bob needs 160 bags, so the total cost is 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we need to consider the total number of puppies and the number of puppies with spots. 

First, we must identify the total number of puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies, and Brandon has 12.  Therefore, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20.

Next, we must identify the number of puppies with spots. Jennifer has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon has 4 spotted puppies.  In total, there are 3 + 4 = 7 spotted puppies.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.  This is calculated by dividing the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiplying by 100%.  

(7 / 20) * 100% = 35%

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

"The question presents a scenario involving the purchase of apples at different prices and the application of discounts.  To determine the difference in cost between Becky and Kelly, we must first calculate the cost of each individual's purchase. 

**Becky's Purchase:**

* Becky purchased 20 apples at a price of $0.45 per apple, resulting in a total cost of 20 * $0.45 = $9.00.
* After a $1.00 discount, her final cost is $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00.

**Kelly's Purchase:**

* Kelly purchased 20 apples at a price of $0.50 per apple, resulting in a total cost of 20 * $0.50 = $10.00.
* A 10% discount is applied to her purchase, reducing the price to $10.00 - (0.10 * $10.00) = $9.00.

**Comparison:**

* To determine the difference in cost, we subtract Becky's final price from Kelly's final price: $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky for her apples.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical framework.  

We are given that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, and his father has stipulated a specific condition: the number of cookies he can have is half the number of carrot sticks he consumes, plus two additional cookies for cleaning his room. 

To determine the number of carrot sticks Matt must consume, we can set up an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
* The number of cookies he receives is 0.5x + 2.
* The total number of cookies he wants to eat is 5.

Therefore, we can formulate the equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5.

Solving for 'x', we get:

* Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
* Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

**Answer:** Matt must eat 6 carrot sticks.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.

We are given that three-fourths of the students at a certain grade level have a desktop computer at home.  This means that 3/4 of the total number of students possess such a device.  We are also informed that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

To determine the total number of students, we can utilize the following equation:

* **Total Students = (Students with Computers) + (Students without Computers)**

We know that 20 students are without computers.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

* **Total Students = (3/4)x - 20**

Where 'x' represents the total number of students.

To find the value of 'x', we can use the information that 20 students are without computers.  This means that:

* **(3/4)x - 20 = 1/4 * x**

Solving for 'x', we get:

* **(3/4)x - (1/4)x = 20**
* **(1/4)x = 20**
* **x = 20 * 4**
* **x = 80**

Therefore, there are **80** students at that grade level.

"The question presents a scenario involving the capacity of portable media players and the number of songs each individual possesses.  To determine the difference in song capacity, we must first determine the number of songs Luri can add to his player. 

Luri has 3 times the number of songs Gabriel has, so he can add 3 * 20 = 60 songs to his player. 

To find the difference in song capacity, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.  Gabriel can add 100 - 20 = 80 songs, and Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 songs. 

The difference in song capacity is 80 - 40 = 40.

"To calculate the average highest temperature, we must first sum the highest temperatures recorded in each country.  The highest temperatures are: -48°F, 21°F, and -3°F.  

Adding these temperatures together gives us -48 + 21 - 3 = -20°F.

Finally, we divide this sum by the number of countries to find the average: -20°F / 3 = -6.67°F. 

Therefore, the average highest temperature of these three countries is -6.67°F.

"The question presents a scenario involving a sale and a coupon.  To determine the final cost per razor, we must first analyze the terms of the sale and the coupon. 

The sale offers a ""buy one get one free"" promotion, meaning the price of two razors is effectively reduced to the cost of one.  This is a common sales tactic to incentivize purchases.

Next, we must consider the coupon.  The coupon is a reduction in the price of the razors.  

Therefore, the final cost per razor is the price of the razors after the sale and the coupon are applied.

"The question presents a classic cost-benefit analysis problem.  To determine the point at which the two venues are equally priced, we need to equate the total cost of each option. 

Let's break it down:

* **Venue 1:** The fixed cost is $200, and the cost per guest is $5.  
* **Venue 2:** The cost per guest is $25.

To find the point of equality, we need to find the number of guests that make the total cost of each venue the same.  

**Formulating the Equation:**

Let 'x' represent the number of guests.

* **Venue 1:** Total cost = $200 + $5x
* **Venue 2:** Total cost = $25x

Setting the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

**Solving for x:**

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

**Answer:**  10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equally priced.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach. 

We are given that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.  We need to determine how many insects Lily found.

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
    * David found half of Bodhi's insects, so David found x/2 insects.
    * Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

* **Solve the equation:**
    * Combine like terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
    * Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
    * Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

* **Find Lily's insects:**
    * Lily found (x/2) + 7 = (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

To simplify this, we find a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.  Therefore, 1/4 is equivalent to 1/4.  

Now, we can add the fractions: 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4.

Finally, we multiply this combined fraction by the total yards per skein: (3/4) * 364 yards/skein = 273 yards.

**Answer:** 273 yards

"The cost of purchasing snowshoes for Mario's dogs is determined by the number of pairs of snowshoes needed, which is calculated by dividing the total number of dogs by the number of legs per pair of snowshoes.  

**Therefore, the cost is determined by the number of pairs of snowshoes needed, which is 6 dogs / 2 legs per pair = 3 pairs.  The cost of each pair is $12.00, so the total cost is 3 pairs * $12.00/pair = $36.00.**

"Let's break down the problem. We are given the following information:

* **Farm:** 30 cows, 10 sheep
* **Zoo:** 60 cows, 20 sheep

We need to determine the total number of animals at both locations.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Direct Comparison:**  We can directly compare the number of cows and sheep at each location.
* **Multiplication and Division:** We can use these operations to find the relationship between the number of animals at each location.

**Solution:**

To find the total number of animals, we need to add the number of animals at each location.

* **Farm:** 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals
* **Zoo:** 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals

**Total:** 40 animals (farm) + 80 animals (zoo) = 120 animals

**Answer:** 120

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Rose purchased 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  We are asked to determine the number of onions and potatoes Sophia purchased. 

The key is understanding the relationship between the quantities purchased by Rose and Sophia.  Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.  

To find the number of onions Sophia bought, we can use the following equation:

* **Rose's onions = 4 * Sophia's onions**

We know Rose bought 12 onions.  Therefore, Sophia bought 12 / 4 = 3 onions.

Similarly, we can find the number of potatoes Sophia bought:

* **Rose's potatoes = 4 * Sophia's potatoes**

We know Rose bought 4 potatoes.  Therefore, Sophia bought 4 / 4 = 1 potato.

Finally, to find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes she bought:

* **Sophia's total = Sophia's onions + Sophia's potatoes**

Sophia's total is 3 + 1 = 4.

"To determine the total water consumption, we need to consider the distance Hannah will run and her consumption rate per kilometer. 

* **Distance:** Hannah will run 8 laps, each 0.25 kilometers long, totaling 8 * 0.25 = 2 kilometers.
* **Consumption:**  She needs 60 milliliters per kilometer, so for 2 kilometers, she will need 60 * 2 = 120 milliliters.

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink **120** milliliters of water.

"Let's break down the problem. Julie initially had $500.  She spent 20% on clothes, which is equivalent to $100.  

Subsequently, she had $400 remaining.  She then spent 25% of this remaining amount on CDs, which is another $100.  

Therefore, Julie has $300 left. 


**Answer:** $300

"Let's analyze the given information. We are told that a house and a lot cost $120,000.  The house costs three times the value of the lot.  To determine the cost of the house, we need to isolate the value of the lot. 

**Option 1:**  Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot.  The house costs three times the lot, so the house costs 3x.  The total cost is the sum of the house and lot, so x + 3x = $120,000.  Combining like terms, we get 4x = $120,000.  Solving for x, we find that the cost of the lot is $30,000.  

**Option 2:**  The house costs three times the lot, so the house costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

"To determine Tara's profit, we need to analyze the financial transactions involved.  

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the canvas bags. Tara purchased 8 packs of 5 bags each, totaling 40 bags.  The cost per bag is $4, so the total cost is 40 bags * $4/bag = $160.

Next, we need to calculate Tara's revenue from selling the bags. She sold each bag for $8, and she sold 40 bags, so her total revenue is 40 bags * $8/bag = $320.

Finally, we can determine Tara's profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue: $320 - $160 = $160. 

Therefore, Tara earned a profit of $160.

"To determine the amount Jeff receives, we need to understand the relationship between their shares.  

Let's break it down:

* **The problem states:** Jeff receives 4 times the amount Brad receives.
* **This translates to:**  Jeff's share is 4 times Brad's share.

We can represent this mathematically:

* Let 'x' represent the amount Brad receives.
* Jeff receives 4x.

The total amount they receive is 100 dollars, so:

* x + 4x = 100

Combining like terms:

* 5x = 100

Solving for x:

* x = 100 / 5
* x = 20

Therefore, Brad receives 20 dollars.

To find Jeff's share, we multiply Brad's share by 4:

* Jeff receives 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.


**Answer:** 80

"The question presents a classic example of a geometric sequence.  Each round of calls effectively multiplies the number of families contacted by a factor of 3.  

To find the total number of families notified after four rounds, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

* **S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)**

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term (in this case, 3 families)
* r = the common ratio (in this case, 3)
* n = the number of terms (in this case, 4)

Plugging in the values:

S = 3 (1 - 3^4) / (1 - 3)
S = 3 (1 - 81) / (-2)
S = 3 (-80) / (-2)
S = 120

**Therefore, 120 families will be notified after four rounds of calls.**

"The question presents a simple economic calculation.  To determine the final cost, we must first calculate the total cost of the items before applying the discount. 

* Notebooks: 5 units * $1.50/unit = $7.50
* Pens: 2 units * $0.25/unit = $0.50
* Calculator: 1 unit * $12.00 = $12.00
* Geometry Set: 1 unit * $10.00 = $10.00

Adding these costs together, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00.

The discount is calculated as 10% of the total cost, which is $20.00 * 0.10 = $2.00.

Subtracting the discount from the original cost, we arrive at the final price: $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00.


**Answer:** $18.00

"Antonella's earnings are calculated based on two distinct tiers of commission:

* **Tier 1:** For goods sold within the first $1000, she earns a 30% commission on the total amount.
* **Tier 2:** For sales exceeding $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount exceeding $1000.

Let's break down her earnings:

* **Tier 1:**  She sold goods worth $2500, and since this is above $1000, we need to calculate the commission on the portion exceeding $1000.
* **Tier 2:**  The amount exceeding $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.  She earns 10% commission on this amount, which is $150.

Therefore, her total commission is the sum of the commissions from both tiers: $300 (Tier 1) + $150 (Tier 2) = $450.

"Let's analyze the given information.  We are told that Jerry's age is twice his age five years ago.  This translates to a mathematical equation:

*  Let Jerry's current age be represented by the variable ""x"".
*  Five years ago, Jerry was ""x - 5"" years old.

The problem states that Jerry's current age is twice his age five years ago.  This translates to the equation:

*  x = 2(x - 5)

Now, we can solve for ""x"" to find Jerry's current age.

*  x = 2x - 10
*  x - 2x = -10
*  -x = -10
*  x = 10

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To determine Jerry's age in three years, we simply add 3 to his current age:

*  10 + 3 = 13

"Let's analyze the given information.  We know that the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We are given that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another is three times the smallest angle.  

To find the largest angle, we need to determine the value of the smallest angle.  

Let's represent the smallest angle with the variable 'x'.  The other two angles can then be expressed as 2x and 3x.

The sum of the angles in the triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x, we find:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

Now, the largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so:

3 * 30 degrees = 90 degrees

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

"To determine the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we need to consider the production rates of both individuals and the total time they worked. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

* Ruiz produces 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.
* Marissa produces 3/4 times the amount Ruiz produces in two hours, meaning she produces 90 pounds per hour.
* They work for 12 hours in a day.

**Solution:**

1. **Ruiz's Production:** Ruiz produces 120 pounds in two hours, so his production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

2. **Marissa's Production:** Marissa produces 90 pounds per hour.

3. **Total Production:**  To find the total production, we need to consider the individual production rates and the total working hours. 
    * Ruiz's production in 12 hours: 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds
    * Marissa's production in 12 hours: 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1080 pounds

"To determine Patrick's earnings, we need to consider the earnings from each period of his lemonade sales. 

**First, let's calculate earnings from the first four hours:**

* He sold 15 cups per hour for four hours, resulting in 15 * 4 = 60 cups sold.
* The price per cup is $0.50, so his earnings for the first four hours are 60 * $0.50 = $30.00.

**Next, we need to calculate earnings from the next two hours:**

* He sold 10 cups per hour for two hours, resulting in 10 * 2 = 20 cups sold.
* The price per cup is $0.60, so his earnings for the next two hours are 20 * $0.60 = $12.00.

**Finally, to find his total earnings, we add the earnings from both periods:**

* Patrick's total earnings are $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.


Therefore, Patrick earned $42.00 from selling lemonade for six hours.

"The question presents a scenario involving tire rotations and mileage.  To determine the lifespan of a tire based on these factors, we need to consider the relationship between rotations and the tire's intended service life. 

**However, the provided information is insufficient to determine a definitive answer.**  

Here's why:

* **Tire wear and tear:** Tire wear is a complex process influenced by factors like driving conditions, tire type, and maintenance.  
* **Rotation frequency:** The provided information states a specific rotation rate per mile, but this doesn't account for the tire's overall wear and tear. 
* **Tire replacement standards:**  There is no standard or legal requirement for tire replacement based solely on the number of rotations. 

**Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact number of years a tire will last based solely on the given information.**

"The problem presents a direct proportionality relationship between the number of potatoes and hash browns.  To determine the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes, we can use the following logic:

**Understanding Proportionality**

In this scenario, the number of hash browns produced is directly proportional to the number of potatoes used. This means that if we increase the number of potatoes, the number of hash browns produced will also increase proportionally.

**Solving for the Unknown**

To find the number of hash browns, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of hash browns produced from 96 potatoes.
*  We know that 6 potatoes produce 36 hash browns.

Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

To determine the difference in candy possession, we must calculate the total candy consumed by each individual over the two-week period. 

Ginger consumes 4 pieces per day, and over two weeks, she consumes 4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces.

Amy consumes 3 pieces per day, and over two weeks, she consumes 3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces.

The difference in candy possession is 56 pieces - 42 pieces = 14 pieces. 

Therefore, Amy has 14 pieces more candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"The question presents a scenario involving a cost analysis.  To determine the savings, we must first calculate the total cost incurred by James for picking the blueberries.  

The cost of picking the blueberries is $20 for the initial trip and $1.50 per pound.  Therefore, the total cost is $20 + (30 pounds * $1.50/pound) = $20 + $45 = $65.

Next, we must compare this cost to the cost at the store, which is $2.50 per pound.  The cost at the store is $75 for 30 pounds.

Finally, we can calculate the savings: $75 - $65 = $10. 


**Answer:** James saved $10.

"The scenario presents a complex legal issue.  While Ron is understandably frustrated with the pothole, the city council's refusal to fix it does not automatically grant him the right to undertake repairs.  

The fine imposed by the city council for unauthorized road maintenance is a significant factor.  It is important to note that the law often distinguishes between ""private"" and ""public"" property.  The pothole is a public issue, and the city council is responsible for maintaining the public roads.  

However, the city council's refusal to address the pothole could be considered a breach of their duty of care, potentially leading to a legal claim for damages.  

**Therefore, the question of whether Ron would save money by fixing the pothole is not a simple one.**  It depends on the specific legal framework of the city and the nature of the city council's actions.

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the number of pizza slices remaining after a certain number of individuals consume portions of their pizzas. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Initial Quantity:**  We start with 60 slices of pizza.
* **Portion Consumption:**  Bryce and two friends consume 2/3 of the pizza, which is 10 slices.
* **Remaining Portion:**  The remaining portion is 50 slices.
* **Final Consumption:** The remaining two friends consume 3/4 of the remaining portion, which is 15 slices.

**Solution:**

To find the final number of slices left, we need to subtract the slices consumed from the initial quantity. 

**Answer:** 35 slices. 
"
"The question presents a scenario involving the consumption of sausages by a cat and a dog.  To determine the average time taken to consume these sausages, we must first determine the individual consumption rates of each animal. 

The cat consumes nine sausages in 30 minutes, indicating a consumption rate of 9 sausages / 30 minutes = 0.3 sausages per minute.

The dog, on the other hand, consumes the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes, meaning it consumes 0.3 sausages per minute * (2/3) = 0.2 sausages per minute.

To calculate the average time, we must consider the total time taken by both animals.  

The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 20 minutes.  The total time is 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

The average time is then 50 minutes / 2 animals = 25 minutes.

"Let's break down this problem.  We are given that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  We need to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Topher's shoe:**  We know the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches.
* **Bobby's shoe:** We need to find the length of Bobby's shoe, which we can represent with the variable 'x'.

**Setting up the Equation:**

The problem states that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  This translates to the following equation:

100 = 9x + 10

**Solving for x:**

To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it.  Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

90 = 9x

Now, divide both sides by 9:

x = 10

**Answer:**  Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is **10 inches** long.

"Hannah's actions constitute a serious crime.  While the specific details of the law vary by jurisdiction, generally, vandalism and property damage are considered criminal offenses.  

To determine the exact legal ramifications, we would need to consider:

* **The specific laws of the jurisdiction:**  Laws regarding property damage and criminal intent vary significantly.
* **The intent of Hannah's actions:**  Was this a spontaneous act of emotional distress, or was there a premeditated plan? 
* **The extent of the damage:**  The number of windows smashed would be a factor in determining the severity of the offense.

It's important to remember that even if Hannah's actions are not considered a felony, she could still face civil liability for the damages she caused.

"The question presents a scenario involving a series of voting events.  To determine the number of individuals who did not vote by 16:00, we must first determine the number of individuals who voted at each stage. 

* **Midday:** 2/5 of the initial 5000 voters cast their ballots, resulting in 2000 votes.
* **16:00:** 2/3 of the remaining voters cast their ballots, with 2000 individuals voting.

To find the number of individuals who did not vote by 16:00, we must subtract the number of voters who cast their ballots from the initial number of voters. 

**Therefore, the number of individuals who did not vote by 16:00 is 5000 - 2000 - 2000 = 1000.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.  We are also given that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.  Finally, we are given that Dora is 15 years old.

To solve this, we need to find the ages of Dora's father and her mother.  

* **Dora's father's age:**  Let's represent Dora's age as ""D"".  Twice Dora's age is 2D. Eight more than twice Dora's age is 2D + 8.  We know this is equal to Dora's father's age, so we can set up an equation: 2D + 8 = D + 8.  Solving for D, we get D = 0.  This is not possible, so we need to re-examine our assumptions. 

* **Dora's father's age:**  Let's represent Dora's age as ""D"".  Twice Dora's age is 2D. Eight more than twice Dora's age is 2D + 8.

The remaining votes were then allocated to Candidate C.  

To find the number of votes Candidate C received, we need to consider the total percentage of votes.  

**Therefore, Candidate C received 100% - 20% - 70% = 10% of the votes.**

"Let's break down this scenario.  We know the regulation passed with twice the number of votes in favor as against it.  This means the number of votes in favor is equal to twice the number of votes against.  

We also know the total number of council members is 33.  

To find the number of votes in favor, we can use the following equation:

* **Favorable votes = 2 * (Votes against)**

Let's represent the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'.  

* **Favorable votes = 2x**

We know that the total number of votes is 33.  Therefore:

* **x + 2x = 33**

Combining like terms:

* **3x = 33**

Solving for 'x':

* **x = 33 / 3 = 11**

Now, we can find the number of votes in favor:

* **Favorable votes = 2 * 11 = 22**

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we need to break down the number of students needing each size shirt. 

* **Extra-small:** 11 students
* **Small:** Twice the number of extra-small students is 11 * 2 = 22 students.
* **Medium:** Four less than the number of size small students is 22 - 4 = 18 students.
* **Large:** Half the number of size medium students is 18 / 2 = 9 students.
* **Extra-large:** Six more than the size large students is 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Adding these numbers together, we get 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 65 students. 

Therefore, Krissa ordered 65 shirts.

"Let's break down this problem using logic and deduction. 

We know that one-third of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.  We also know that one-third of the Pomeranians are girls.  This means that the number of Pomeranians is directly related to the number of girls.

We are given that there are 6 girls.  To find the total number of Pomeranians, we can use the following equation:

* **Total Pomeranians = Number of girls * 3**

Therefore, the total number of Pomeranians is 6 * 3 = 18.

Finally, we can find the total number of puppies by using the proportion:

* **Total Puppies = Total Pomeranians * (2/3)**

Therefore, the total number of puppies is 18 * (2/3) = 12.

"Let's analyze the situation. Mike wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series, and he can acquire those for a discounted price of $6 per movie.  The remaining movies are not in series and are older movies, costing $5 each.  

To determine the total cost of the replacement, we need to consider the following:

1. **Series movies:** 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies.
2. **Movies not in series:** 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies.
3. **Cost of older movies:** 400 movies * $5/movie = $2000.
4. **Cost of normal movies:** 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies.
5. **Total cost:** $2000 + (400 movies * $10/movie) = $2000 + $4000 = $6000.

Therefore, the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is $6000.

"To determine Winston's total expenditure, we must calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum those costs. 

* **Peaches:** 6 pounds at $2.00 per pound results in a cost of 6 * $2.00 = $12.00
* **Plums:** 8 pounds at $1.00 per pound results in a cost of 8 * $1.00 = $8.00
* **Apricots:** 6 pounds at $3.00 per pound results in a cost of 6 * $3.00 = $18.00

Adding these costs together, we get $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00. 

Therefore, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the number of white fish Bob purchased. 

Here's what we know:

* Bob started with 7 fish.
* He added 17 fish to his pond.
* After adding the new fish, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

To solve this, let's use variables:

"The question presents a scenario involving a group of individuals participating in a scavenger hunt.  The key to solving this problem is to break it down into manageable steps. 

First, we need to determine the number of groups formed.  The problem states that 90 people were required to be split into groups.  Dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group, we find that 90 people / 9 people per group = 10 groups.

Next, we need to determine the number of people who brought seashells. The problem states that 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells.  This means that 3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups brought seashells.

Finally, we need to calculate the total number of seashells brought.  We know that each group had 6 groups * 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells.

"Jamie's earnings for her work on Tuesday can be calculated by considering her regular hourly rate and the additional pay she receives for working overtime. 

First, we need to determine her regular hourly rate.  She earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work, so her regular hourly rate is $20.

Next, we need to calculate her overtime rate.  She is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate for any hours worked beyond her regular 8-hour shift.  This means her overtime rate is $20 * 1.50 = $30 per hour.

Finally, we can calculate her total earnings for the 11 hours she worked.  Her total earnings are $30 * 11 = $330.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to compare the earnings of Billy and Sally after working 20 hours.  Billy's earnings are affected by his initial hourly rate, a raise after two months, and another raise on his anniversary.  Sally's starting salary is a key factor in determining her earnings.

**Key Calculations:**

* **Billy's Hourly Rate:** Billy's initial hourly rate was $10. After a raise of $0.50, his rate was $10.50. After a further raise of $1.00, his rate is $11.50.
* **Sally's Hourly Rate:**  Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial rate, so her starting hourly rate is $10.50.

**Determining the Difference:**

To find the difference in earnings, we need to calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours and then subtract Sally's earnings for the same number of hours.

**Answer:** Billy will earn $20.00 more than Sally.

"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should purchase to achieve a 30% representation of her collection, we must first calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently possesses.  

She has three puppies, five koalas, two zebras, and four frogs, totaling 14 stuffed animals.  

Next, we need to determine the desired percentage of stuffed goats.  This is 30% of her total collection.  

To find the number of goats, we can use the following formula:

Desired Percentage = (Number of Goats / Total Number of Stuffed Animals) * Total Number of Stuffed Animals

30% = (Number of Goats / 14) * 14

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30% = Number of Goats

Therefore, Bubbles should purchase 30 goats to achieve the desired percentage.

"To determine Kris's remaining hours, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and the remaining hours needed to reach the 30-hour goal. 

First, let's consider the initial phase of her gameplay:

* She plays for half an hour each day for two weeks, which is 7 days. 
* This translates to 7 days * 0.5 hours/day = 3.5 hours.

Next, we need to consider the second phase of her gameplay:

* She plays for 2 hours each day for a week, which is 7 days.
* This translates to 7 days * 2 hours/day = 14 hours.

Therefore, Kris has played a total of 3.5 hours + 14 hours = 17.5 hours.

Finally, we can calculate the remaining hours needed to reach the 30-hour goal:

* 30 hours (goal) - 17.5 hours (played) = 12.5 hours.

**Answer:** Kris still needs to play 12.5 hours.

"The question presents a straightforward calculation of the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase.  

To determine the total number of petals, we must first calculate the total number of petals from each group of flowers and then subtract the number of petals lost. 

* **Group 1:** 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
* **Group 2:** 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
* **Group 3:** 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
* **Group 4:** 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals

Adding the total number of petals from each group: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

Finally, we must subtract the number of petals lost: 101 - 1 = 100 petals.

Therefore, the total number of petals in the vase is 100.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  We're given a recipe for a salt scrub, and we need to determine the amount of oil used. 

Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

* **Quantity:** Tanya makes a 10-ounce batch of the scrub.
* **Proportions:**  The recipe uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar.
* **Ratio:** Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

**To solve this, we need to establish a system of equations:**

Let's use the following variables:

* **x:** Amount of zest
* **y:** Amount of salt
* **z:** Amount of sugar
* **o:** Amount of oil

**Now, let's translate the given information into equations:**

*  x = fragrance (same amount as zest)
*  y = 2x (twice as much salt as zest)
*  o = 2y (twice as much oil as salt)
*  y = z (same amount of salt as sugar)
*  10 ounces = total amount of scrub (we'll use this to solve for the variables)

**Solving for the amount of oil (o):**

"To determine the total cost, we must first calculate the cost of the goats and then the cost of the cows.  The cost of the goats is 3 goats multiplied by the price per goat, which is $500.  This gives us $1500.  The cost of the cows is 2 cows multiplied by the price per cow, which is $1500.  This gives us $3000.  Finally, we add the cost of the goats and the cost of the cows to find the total cost.  This gives us $1500 + $3000 = $4500. 


**Answer:** $4500

"Let's break down the problem.  We are asked to determine the number of cars Joe has remaining after selling and gifting some to his mother.

* **Joe's initial cars:** Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. Therefore, Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.
* **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.
* **Cars gifted:** Joe gives away twice the number he sold to his mother, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.
* **Cars remaining:** Joe starts with 40 cars and sells 8, then gives away 16, leaving him with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.


**Answer:** 16

"The question presents a straightforward scenario involving a group effort to raise funds.  To determine the amount each student contributed, we need to isolate the funds raised by the students. 

The total amount raised is $175,000, and $50,000 of this amount was contributed by organizations.  Therefore, the students contributed the remaining amount, which is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

To find out how much each student contributed, we divide the total amount raised by the number of students: $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. 


**Answer:** $6,250

"Let's break down the problem.  Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day and half that amount on the second day.  To find the total time, we need to add the two durations. 

* **Day 1:** 8 hours
* **Day 2:** 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours
* **Total Time:** 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60: 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

**Answer:** 720 minutes

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given a series of events involving the number of cars in a parking lot.  

* **Initial count:**  Hunter begins with 50 cars.
* **First break:**  He observes an increase of 20 cars, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.
* **Lunch break:**  We are told that half the cars have departed.  This means 70 / 2 = 35 cars are left.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"John's weekly earnings are calculated as follows:

* **Daily Earnings:** John performs 30 cycles of work per day, each cycle consisting of 5 tasks.  
* **Total Tasks:**  He completes 30 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks per day.
* **Daily Earnings:** Each task pays $1.20, so he earns 150 tasks * $1.20/task = $180.00 per day.

"The question presents a straightforward comparison of quantities.  To determine the difference in the number of cat food tins and dog food tins purchased, we must first calculate the total number of cat food tins and dog food tins. 

Kimberly purchased 8 packages of cat food, each containing 11 tins, totaling 8 * 11 = 88 tins.  She also purchased 6 packages of dog food, each containing 6 tins, totaling 6 * 6 = 36 tins.

The difference between the number of cat food tins and dog food tins is 88 - 36 = 52. 

Therefore, Kimberly purchased 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's analyze the given information to determine the number of cards Becca possesses.

We are given that the total number of cards across Becca, Smendrick, and PJ is 341.  We can express this mathematically as:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

We can then set up an equation to represent the total number of cards:

* x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying the equation:

* 7x + 12 = 341

Solving for 'x':

* 7x = 329
* x = 47

This means PJ has 47 cards.  

To find Becca's cards, we can substitute the value of 'x' back into the expression for Becca's cards:

* Becca's cards = 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards. 


**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total number of eggs Cindy collected. 

* **Green eggs:** Cindy has 5 green eggs.
* **Blue eggs:** She has twice the number of blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* **Pink eggs:** She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
* **Yellow eggs:** She has one-third the number of yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
* **Total eggs:**  Adding all the types of eggs, Cindy has 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem. Mulan begins with $40. Her father gives her an additional $100.  She then purchases two pairs of jeans at $30 each, totaling $60, and a bag for $20.  

To determine her remaining funds, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from her initial amount. 

The total cost of the jeans and bag is $60 + $20 = $80.  

Mulan's final balance is $140 - $80 = $60. 


**Answer:** $60

"Let's break down the problem. Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.  We know he produces 8,000 bars in the first week, and then the production fluctuates.  

To determine the production in the fourth week, we need to consider the production in the first three weeks.  

* **Week 1:** 8,000 bars
* **Week 2:** 4,000 bars
* **Week 3:** 24,000 bars

The total production for the first three weeks is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To find the production in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week. 
"
"Let's analyze Britany's TikTok activity.  We need to determine the total time she spends on TikTok each month. 

* **Video Creation:**  Britany records 18 videos per week, each lasting 4 minutes. This totals 18 * 4 = 72 minutes per week.
* **Songwriting:** She dedicates 2 hours per week to writing songs, which is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes per week.
* **Makeup:**  She spends 15 minutes each day on makeup, and there are 6 days a week. This translates to 15 * 6 = 90 minutes per week.

To find her total weekly TikTok time, we add the three components: 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes.

Finally, we multiply this weekly time by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4: 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes.

Therefore, Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok each month.

"Let's analyze the situation. The firm charges a base fee of $129.00 for installation, which covers the hanging of four mirrors, two shelves, one chandelier, and ten pictures.  

However, they also charge an additional $15.00 per item for any additional items. Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed. 

To calculate the total cost, we need to consider the base fee and the additional cost for each item. 

**Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation will be:**

* **Mirrors:** 6 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $90.00
* **Chandeliers:** 2 chandeliers * $15.00/chandelier = $30.00
* **Pictures:** 20 pictures * $15.00/picture = $300.00
* **Total cost:** $129.00 (base fee) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = **$529.00**

"Let's break down the problem to determine Roy's savings.

* **Eva's savings:** Eva saved $20.00.
* **Anthony's savings:** Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
* **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony.  To calculate this, we need to consider that 40% of Anthony's savings is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.  Therefore, Roy saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

**Answer:** Roy has $42.00.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  We are given a series of relationships between the individuals' lifting abilities.  

* **Pompei:**  We know Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
* **Saskay:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, meaning she can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning she can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, meaning he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To find Naruto's lifting ability in feet, we need to convert his lifting height in inches to feet.  

* 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 
* Therefore, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.


**Answer:** 40 feet

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total number of clay dishes.

* **Kora's production:** Kora made 20 clay dishes.
* **Rory's production:** Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so she made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
* **Jada's production:** Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, meaning she made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.
* **Total production:** To find the total number of dishes, we add the individual production: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they made together is 140.

"The question presents a straightforward calculation.  We need to determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used.  

To do this, we first need to determine the total length of the glue sticks that are used.  We can do this by adding the lengths of the three glue sticks that are partially used. 

The total length of the glue sticks that are used is 1/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 8/6 = 4/3.

Finally, we can find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used by subtracting the length of the used glue sticks from the total length of the glue sticks. 

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 32 mm.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given information about the number of socks and dishes possessed by Peter and Jack.  

* **Jack's Dishes:** We know Jack collected 60 dishes.
* **Jack's Socks:**  Jack's collection of socks is twice the number of dishes he collected. Therefore, Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
* **Peter's Socks:** Peter has twice the number of socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
* **Total Socks:**  Peter and Jack have a combined total of 60 + 30 = 90 socks.
* **Total Dishes:** Jack has 60 dishes, and Peter has 60 socks, so they have a total of 60 + 60 = 120 dishes.

**Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 120 = 210.**

"Let's break down the problem.  Mr. Smith has a total of 55 goats on Farm X and 45 goats on Farm Y, totaling 100 goats. He sells 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which is 20 goats.  

To find the total number of goats remaining, we need to consider the goats remaining on each farm after the sales.  

* **Farm X:** Mr. Smith has 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats remaining.
* **Farm Y:** Mr. Smith has 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats remaining.

Finally, we add the goats remaining on each farm to find the total number of goats left: 45 goats + 25 goats = 70 goats.

"Let's break down this problem logically.  We are given a set of relationships between the ages of three individuals: a brother, a sister, and a subject.  We are tasked with determining the age of the subject.

**Let's define our variables:**

*  Let the subject's age be represented by ""x""
*  The brother's age is ""x + 3""
*  The sister's age is ""x - 2""

**Formulate an equation based on the given information:**

The problem states that the sum of the ages of the three individuals equals 87.  This translates to the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

**Solve the equation:**

Combine like terms: 
3x + 1 = 87

Subtract 1 from both sides:
3x = 86

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 28

**Answer:** The subject's age is 28.

"The question presents a straightforward application of basic arithmetic.  To determine the number of glue stick packs Mr. Jackson needs, we must first determine the total number of glue sticks required.  

The problem states that each student requires two glue sticks, and there are 27 students in total.  Therefore, the total number of glue sticks needed is 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = 54 glue sticks.

Next, we must determine the number of packs required to provide each student with two glue sticks. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.  Dividing the total glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack, we get 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs.

Since we can't purchase fractions of packs, we round up to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to purchase **7** packs.

"The question presents a classic example of a chain reaction problem.  To determine the number of infected individuals after three days, we need to consider the compounding effect of each infected person's transmission. 

Let's break it down:

* **Day 1:**  We start with 10 individuals infected. Each infects 6 others, resulting in 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.
* **Day 2:**  The number of infected individuals increases by 60, and each infects 6 others, resulting in 60 * 6 = 360 new infections.
* **Day 3:**  The number of infected individuals increases by 360, and each infects 6 others, resulting in 360 * 6 = 2160 new infections.

Therefore, after three days, the total number of infected individuals is 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 = **2630**.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that 40 customers each tipped $20 to Rafaela.  We are also told that Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela's total tips.  

To find the total amount of money received by both Rafaela and Julieta, we need to consider the following:

* **Rafaela's total tips:**  40 customers * $20/customer = $800
* **Julieta's tips:**  We need to calculate this based on the percentage reduction.  Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, we can represent this as a decimal: 0.90 (representing 90% of Rafaela's tips).  
* **Julieta's total tips:**  $800 * 0.90 = $720

**Therefore, the total amount of money received by both Rafaela and Julieta is $800 + $720 = $1520.**

"Let's break down the problem to determine Paige's earnings. 

First, we need to understand the key elements:

* **Production Rate:** Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour.
* **Slices per Loaf:** Each loaf yields 8 slices.
* **Price per Slice:** Each slice is sold for $0.50.
* **Time of Operation:** Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM.

To calculate Paige's total earnings, we need to consider the following:

1. **Total Loaves Baked:**  Paige baked for 5 hours, and she bakes 2 loaves per hour, so she baked 5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves.

2. **Total Slices:** Each loaf has 8 slices, and Paige baked 10 loaves, so she produced 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

3. **Total Earnings:** Paige sold each slice for $0.50, and she has 80 slices, so her total earnings are 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.00.


**Therefore, Paige raised $40.00 from her bake sale.**

"Let's break down the problem. We are given that Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  We also know she has 70 gold coins.  To find the total number of coins, we need to consider the relationship between the two types of coins. 

* **Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.** 
* **Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver, she has x + 30 gold coins.**
* **We know she has 70 gold coins, so x + 30 = 70**

Solving for 'x', we get:
* **x = 70 - 30 = 40**

Now, we can calculate the total number of coins:
* **Total coins = silver coins + gold coins = 40 + 70 = 110**

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach. 

We are given that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books.  We need to determine the number of books Fawn possesses.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.
    * Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has 'F - 12' books.
    * Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has 'F - 12 + 25' books.

* **Formulate an equation:**
    * The total number of books is the sum of the books each person has: F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

* **Solve for F:**
    * Combine like terms: 3F + 13 = 85
    * Subtract 13 from both sides: 3F = 72
    * Divide both sides by 3: F = 24

**Therefore, Fawn has 24 books.**

* **The final concert is twice the length of her usual concerts:**  This means the final concert's runtime is 2 * x.
* **The final concert also includes an encore:** This means the final concert's runtime is 65 minutes.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 2 * x + 15 = 65

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. Subtract 15 from both sides: 2 * x = 50
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

**Answer:** Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

**Total Calories:** 200 mini cinnamon rolls * 200 calories/roll + 300 mini blueberry muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 85,000 calories.

"To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we need to sum the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days and then divide by the number of days. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Total Junebugs Removed:** 39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday & Wednesday combined) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 192 Junebugs
* **Average:** 192 Junebugs / 5 days = 38.4 Junebugs per day

**Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 38.4.**

"The question asks for the difference in distance traveled by the bus and the car.  To determine this, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled. 

* **Bus:** The bus traveled for 5 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, resulting in a distance of 60 miles * 5 = 300 miles.
* **Car:** The car traveled for 8 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, resulting in a distance of 30 miles * 8 = 240 miles.

The difference in distance is 300 miles - 240 miles = 60 miles. 

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls in the tube, we must isolate the quantity of bouncy balls.  

We know the total number of toys Sophie possesses is 62.  We also know she has 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings.  

Subtracting the sum of these other toys from the total number of toys gives us the number of bouncy balls: 62 - 48 = 14.

Therefore, Sophie's tube contained **14** bouncy balls.

"Let's break down this problem using the principles of logic and deduction. 

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We are also told that Paul is 10 years older than John.  Finally, we are told that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages.

To solve this, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the ages of Peter, Paul, and John with the variables P, P+10, and J respectively.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
* **Equation 2:** P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

Now, we can solve for the ages.  

From Equation 2, we can isolate J:
* J = P - P - 10 
* J = -10

This result is not possible as age cannot be negative.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial Balloons:** Maria starts with 1 balloon and her 4 friends each have 2 balloons, totaling 4 * 2 = 8 balloons.
* **Mom's Contribution:** Maria's mom adds 3 balloons to each of the 4 friends, totaling 3 * 4 = 12 balloons.
* **Total Balloons:**  The total number of balloons is 8 + 12 = 20.

Therefore, the girls have a total of 20 balloons.

"To determine the number of new tables required, we need to consider the total number of boxes available for the yard sale and the number of tables they already possess. 

The charity group has 60 boxes of items to sell, and each table can accommodate 2 boxes.  Therefore, they can fit 60 / 2 = 30 tables worth of items. 

They currently have 15 tables, so they need to acquire 30 - 15 = 15 more tables. 


**Answer:** 15

"To determine the average total distance spat, we must first calculate the total distance for each contestant. Zoey, with 40 seeds spitting 10 feet per seed, has a total distance of 40 * 10 = 400 feet. Sydney, with 35 seeds spitting 12 feet per seed, has a total distance of 35 * 12 = 420 feet.  

To find the average, we sum the distances and divide by the number of contestants.  The total distance spat is 400 + 420 = 820 feet.  

The average distance spat is 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

"The hotel's pricing structure presents a clear choice for Cameron.  He can choose to pay a flat fee for a 12-hour stay, or pay an additional fee for each hour exceeding the initial 12-hour period.  

To determine the cost-effective option, we need to consider the total hours Cameron will be staying.  He will be staying for 12 hours, which is covered by the initial 12-hour rate.  

The question then asks about the cost savings.  The cost of the 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos.  The additional cost for the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos.  

Therefore, Cameron would save 1600 pesos - 1000 pesos = 600 pesos.

"To determine the total hay needed, we must first calculate the hay required for each type of animal.  

* **Goats:** Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
* **Sheep:** Each sheep requires 3 pounds less than twice the amount a goat needs, so they require 7 pounds.

Next, we must calculate the total hay needed for each animal type and then add the amounts together.

* **Goats:** 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
* **Sheep:** 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Finally, we add the hay needed for both types of animals: 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs a total of 159 pounds of hay. 


**Answer:** 159

"Let's break down the problem to determine the answer.

John has a total of $300 after working 6 hours at $50 per hour. He spends $50 on gas, leaving him with $250.  He then purchases 5 pencils at $10 each, leaving him with $240.  

To determine how many 25-dollar pens he can buy, we divide his remaining funds by the cost per pen: $240 / $25 = 9.6. 

Since he can't buy a fraction of a pen, John can buy **9** pens.

"The question presents a straightforward scenario involving the distribution of apple juice.  

To determine the number of bottles remaining for the teacher, we must first calculate the total number of bottles distributed to students.  The teacher provides each student with 2 bottles of apple juice.  

The teacher then redeems all 9 coupons, which equates to 900 bottles of apple juice.  

Subtracting the juice given to students from the total juice available, we find that the teacher has 842 bottles remaining.

"The total cost of the repair is calculated as follows:

* **Fixed Fee:** Patty charges a $40 fee for the initial visit.
* **Hourly Labor Rate:** The labor cost is $35 per hour, with a minimum charge of $35. 
* **Parts Cost:** The cost of parts is $60.

To find the total cost, we add the fixed fee, labor cost, and parts cost:

$40 (fixed fee) + $35 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $135

**Therefore, the total cost of the repair is $135.**

"The question presents a scenario involving a potential financial loss.  To determine the exact financial outcome, we need to analyze the transaction's elements. 

First, we must consider the nature of the transaction.  The initial purchase of the CDs is a purchase, and the subsequent sale of some of the CDs is a sale.  The question does not explicitly state whether the sale of the CDs constitutes a ""sale"" or a ""gift.""  

However, the fact that James is selling the CDs for $40 each, and the initial purchase price was $150, suggests that the sale is a commercial transaction.  

Therefore, we can conclude that James incurred a loss of $50.

"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate the monetary value of each type of root crop and then sum those values. 

* **Yams:** Jen has 6 yams, each selling for $1.50.  Therefore, the total earnings from yams is 6 * $1.50 = $9.00.
* **Sweet Potatoes:** Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, each selling for $2.00.  The total earnings from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2.00 = $20.00.
* **Carrots:** Jen has 4 carrots, each selling for $1.25. The total earnings from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.00.

Finally, we add the earnings from each type of root crop to find Jen's total earnings: $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00.

"Let's analyze the scenario. James must swim 20 miles across a lake, and we need to determine the total time it takes him to complete the journey. 

**Step 1: Distance Covered**

James swims 60% of the lake's distance, which is 20 miles * 0.60 = 12 miles.

**Step 2: Swimming Time**

He swims at a rate of 2 miles per hour, so the time taken to cover the 12 miles is 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours.

**Step 3: Rest Time**

James rests for half the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

**Step 4: Remaining Distance**

After his rest, he needs to cover the remaining distance, which is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

**Step 5: Speed for Remaining Distance**

He swims at half the speed he did for the initial 12 miles, which is 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour.

**Step 6: Time for Remaining Distance**

The time taken to cover the remaining 8 miles at a speed of 1 mile/hour is 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours.

**Step 7: Total Time**

The total time taken by James is the sum of the swimming time, rest time, and the time spent on the remaining distance. Therefore, the total time is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.


**Answer:** 17 hours.

"Let's break down this problem. We're given that the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday.  We know Sam had 70 loaves.  

To find the number of loaves the bakery has, we need to calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had and then subtract 40. 

* **Seven times Sam's loaves:** 7 * 70 = 490
* **40 less than seven times Sam's loaves:** 490 - 40 = 450

Therefore, the bakery has **450** loaves of bread.

"To determine Cayley's total commission, we need to consider the commission rates for each newspaper and the number of copies sold. 

**New York Times:**

* Commission rate: 10%
* Number of copies sold: 6
* Commission per copy: $5 * 0.10 = $0.50
* Total commission for New York Times: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

**Wall Street Journal:**

* Commission rate: 8%
* Number of copies sold: 10
* Commission per copy: $15 * 0.08 = $1.20
* Total commission for Wall Street Journal: $1.20 * 10 = $12.00

**Total Commission:**

* $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  

We are given that the team scored a total of 45 points, with each individual contributing.  We are also given that Bahati scored the most points, and his score is 20 more than Azibo's and 10 more than Dinar's.  

To solve for Azibo's score, we can use a system of equations.  

**Let's represent the scores:**

* Dinar's score: D
* Azibo's score: A
* Bahati's score: B

**Formulate the equations based on the given information:**

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

**Solve for A:**

* Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute:
   * D + 10 = A + 20
   * A = D - 10

* Substitute this value of A into the total points equation:
   * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

* Simplify and solve for D:
   * 3D + 10 = 45
   * 3D = 35
   * D = 35 / 3 
   * D = 11.67 (approximately)

* Now, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:
   * A = D - 10
   * A = 11.67 - 10
   * A = 1.67 (approximately)

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that Jen's total expenses for his trip are $400.  The cost of his travel is 50% more than the cost of his supplies.  

To find the cost of the travel, we need to consider the following:

* **Supplies:**  Jen spends $400 on supplies.
* **Travel:** The cost of travel is 50% more than the supplies, meaning it's 1.50 times the cost of the supplies.

Therefore, we can represent the cost of travel as 1.50 times the cost of supplies. 

**To find the cost of travel, we can set up an equation:**

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the travel.
* The cost of travel is 1.50 times the cost of supplies, so it's 1.50 * $400 = $600.

**The cost of travel is $600.**

"Let's analyze the given information to determine the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.

We are given that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a combined total of 339 Pokemon.  We can express this mathematically as:

* A + S + W = 339

We are also given that:

* A = S + 5  (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)

To solve for Stan's catch, we need to isolate 'S' in the first equation and substitute it into the second equation. 

**Solving for 'S'**

* From the first equation, we can express 'S' as: S = A - 5

* Substitute this value of 'S' into the second equation: (A - 5) = 4W - 13

* We can now solve for 'W' by rearranging the equation: 
    * A - 5 = 4W - 13
    * A = 4W - 8

* We know that A = S + 5, so we can substitute this into the equation above:
    * (S + 5) = 4W - 8

* We can now solve for 'W' by rearranging the equation:
    * S + 5 = 4W - 8
    * S + 13 = 4W
    * W = (S + 13)/4

* We know that W = 41 (from the given information). Substitute this value into the equation for 'W':
    * W = 41

**Finding Stan's Catch**

* Substitute the value of W back into the equation for 'S':
    * S = 4(41) - 13
    * S = 164 - 13
    * S = 151

**Therefore, Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.**

"The question presents a straightforward economic calculation.  To determine the total cost, we must consider the cost of each individual item and the quantity purchased.  

First, we must calculate the cost of petunias for all baskets.  Each basket requires 3 petunias at a cost of $3.00 per petunia, resulting in a total cost of 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.

Next, we must calculate the cost of sweet potato vines for all baskets. Each basket requires 2 vines at a cost of $2.50 per vine, resulting in a total cost of 2 * $2.50 = $5.00.

Finally, we must add the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines to determine the total cost for all baskets.  The total cost is $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00.

Therefore, the total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets is $14.00.

"Let's break down the problem. Jessica's monthly income is $2,000.00, and she allocates 25% of this to her shoe fund.  This means she has $500.00 available for shoes each month.  Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.  

To determine how many shoes she can purchase, we need to divide her monthly shoe fund by the cost of each shoe:

$500.00 / $1,000.00 per shoe = 0.5 shoes

Since she can't buy a partial shoe, she can purchase a maximum of 0.5 shoes per month. 

However, we need to consider the number of shoes she can buy in a year.  A year has 12 months, so we multiply the number of shoes she can buy per month by the number of months in a year:

0.5 shoes/month * 12 months/year = 6 shoes

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 shoes in a year.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the number of flights to France the first plane makes in a day.

* **First Plane:** The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights, where 'x' represents the total number of flights.
* **Remaining Flights:** The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. This means the first plane makes (1/4)x flights to France and Germany combined.
* **Other Plane:** The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, making 44 trips. This is half the number of flights the first plane makes, meaning the other plane makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**To find the number of flights to France, we need to find the value of 'x'.**

* **The other plane's trips are half the first plane's trips:** 22 = (1/2) * x
* **Solving for x:** x = 22 * 2 = 44

**Therefore, the first plane makes 44 flights to France in a day.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We are asked to determine the total time the three wolves howl. 

* **Tobias:** Howls for 20 seconds.
* **Chikote:** Howls for twice as long as Tobias, so she howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
* **Igneous:** Howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total time, we add the individual howl times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Finally, we convert this to minutes: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

**Understanding the Problem:**

The key to solving this is understanding the relationship between Helene's age and the average age of the group.  We can use this information to find Helene's age and then calculate Wilfred's age.

**Solution:**

1. **Average Age:** The average age of the group is 5 years.

2. **Helene's Age:** Helene is twice the average age, so she is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

3. **Combined Age of Akbar and Alessandro:**  Their combined age is 3 + 4 = 7 years.

4. **Wilfred's Age:**  The total age of all the children minus Helene's age and the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro equals Wilfred's age.  Therefore, Wilfred is 20 - 10 - 7 = 3 years old.

Peter has 64 total chocolate bars and 4 boxes, so each box contains 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 56 total chocolate bars and 7 boxes, so each box contains 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.

The difference in the number of chocolate bars per box is 16 - 8 = 8.

"To determine the total number of sticks, we must first calculate the number of blue sticks.  The problem states there are 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red, so there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  

Next, we need to determine the number of yellow sticks. The problem states the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Finally, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.

"To determine the difference in distance traveled, we must first calculate the distance each individual traveled. 

Matteo traveled for 4 hours at a speed of 55 miles per hour, resulting in a distance of 55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Shandy, on the other hand, traveled for 10 hours at a speed of 45 miles per hour, covering a distance of 45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

The difference in distance is then calculated as 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles. 

Therefore, Shandy traveled 230 miles farther than Matteo. 


**Answer:** 230 miles

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Students over 16:**  The school has 3000 students, and half are over 16, meaning there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16.
* **Male students over 16:**  One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so there are 1500 students / 4 = 375 male students over 16.
* **Female students under 16:**  The remaining students under 16 are 3000 - 1500 = 1500.
* **Female students under 16:**  Half of the students under 16 are female, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 female students under 16.

"Let's break down this problem.  We need to determine the remaining water in the tank after Wanda and Ms. B have filled it. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

The key is to understand the quantities of water pumped each day and how they relate to the total capacity of the tank. 

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total gallons pumped in the first day:** Wanda pumps 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of Wanda's amount, which is 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.  The total pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

2. **Calculate the total gallons pumped in the second day:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons. The total pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

3. **Calculate the total gallons pumped in two days:** The total gallons pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

4. **Calculate the remaining gallons:** The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, and they pumped 12000 gallons, leaving 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.


**Answer:** 6000 gallons

"The problem presents a scenario involving a power bank's charge over time.  We need to determine the initial charge of the power bank. 

Let's break down the information provided:

* **Initial Charge:** We are given that the power bank was fully charged.
* **First 5 Hours:** The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours. This means it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.
* **Remaining Charge:** After 5 hours, the power bank had 55% of its charge remaining.
* **Next 3 Hours:** The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours. This means it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.
* **Final Charge:** The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.

To determine the initial charge, we need to consider the percentage of charge remaining after the 5 hours and the 3 hours.

"The question presents a scenario involving a legal concept known as ""consideration.""  To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work, we must consider the legal principle of ""consideration"" in the context of a contract.  

**Here's a breakdown:**

* **Contract Formation:**  Janet's actions of working and earning wages and tips constitute a form of ""consideration"" in a contract with herself.  
* **Legal Obligation:**  The contract is implied by her actions.  
* **Timeframe:** The timeframe for fulfilling the contract is determined by the amount of work she is willing to perform. 

**Therefore, the answer is:**

**Janet will need to work for 2000 weeks to save the down payment.**

"Jamaar has a limited budget of $10.00 and is purchasing various fruits.  To determine the number of plums he can buy, we need to consider the cost of each fruit type and the remaining funds after purchasing the other fruits. 

Let's break down the costs:

* Peaches: $0.50 per peach
* Pears: $0.50 per pear
* Apples: $0.75 per apple
* Kiwis: $1.00 per kiwi
* Plums: $0.25 per plum

We know he has already purchased 3 peaches, 4 pears, 2 kiwis, and 5 apples.  

To calculate the remaining funds, we subtract the cost of the already purchased fruits from his initial budget: $10.00 - $1.50 - $2.00 - $2.00 - $3.75 = $2.25.

Finally, we divide the remaining funds by the cost of a plum to determine the number of plums he can purchase: $2.25 / $0.25 = 9.

Therefore, Jamaar can purchase **9** plums.

"Let's break down the problem.  Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them into 8 albums.  We need to determine the number of selfies and portraits.

First, we need to determine the number of albums that are not selfies or portraits.  We can do this by subtracting the number of albums that are selfies or portraits from the total number of albums. 

* Total albums: 8
* Selfies: 3
* Portraits: 2
* Albums without selfies or portraits: 8 - 3 - 2 = 3

Now, we can determine the number of pictures in each album that are not selfies or portraits.

* Pictures per album: 72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now, we can determine the number of selfies.

* Number of selfies: 3 albums * 9 pictures/album = 27 selfies

Now, we can determine the number of portraits.

* Number of portraits: 2 albums * 9 pictures/album = 18 portraits


 
**Answer:** Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

"Let's break down the information provided:

* **Initial Guests:** The hotel began with 100 guests.
* **Early Checkouts:** 24 guests opted for early checkouts.
* **Late Checkouts:** 15 guests chose late checkouts.
* **Afternoon Check-ins:** Twice the number of guests who chose late checkouts checked in in the afternoon, meaning 15 * 2 = 30 guests.
* **Dinner Check-ins:** 7 more guests checked in after dinner.

**Calculating the Total:**

* **Total Guests:**  We need to add the number of guests who checked in throughout the day. 
    * 15 (late checkouts) + 30 (afternoon check-ins) + 7 (dinner check-ins) = 52 guests.
* **Final Count:**  We need to subtract the number of guests who checked out early to find the final number of guests.
    * 100 (initial guests) - 24 (early checkouts) - 15 (late checkouts) = 61 guests.
* **Final Count:** 61 (remaining guests) + 52 (new guests) = 113 guests.


**Therefore, the hotel now has 113 guests.**

"Let's break down this problem.  We're given that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals.  We also know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 in total.  

To solve for the number of small stuffed animals she sold, we need to consider the following:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"To determine Suzanne's remaining funds, we must first calculate her total earnings from cookie and cupcake sales.  She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, generating $80 in revenue.  Additionally, she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, resulting in $240 in earnings.  

Next, we must consider the monetary value of the gifts given to her sisters.  She gave each of her sisters $10, totaling $20.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the gifts from her total earnings to determine her remaining funds.  

Therefore, Suzanne has $320 - $20 = $300 left.

"The question presents a classic example of proportional pricing.  To determine the cost of the 8-sandwich package, we need to understand the relationship between the prices of the smaller packages and the cost per sandwich. 

The first package has 2 sandwiches at $3, and the second package has 4 sandwiches at $6.  This means that the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50 and $6 / 4 = $1.50.  

Since the prices are proportional, the cost of the 8-sandwich package is directly related to the price per sandwich.  Therefore, the 8-sandwich package will cost $1.50/sandwich * 8 = $12.00.

"The question presents a simple division problem.  We need to determine the number of tickets each graduate receives. 

First, we need to determine the number of seats available for guests.  The Fine Arts Center can accommodate 6000 people, but we must subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.  

* Graduates: 950 seats
* Faculty: 300 seats
* Total seats reserved: 950 + 300 = 1250 seats
* Available seats: 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats

"Let's break down the calculation. Melissa is paid $15 per day for jury duty, but she also incurs parking expenses of $3 per day.  To determine her net daily earnings, we subtract the parking costs from her daily pay. This leaves her with $15 - $3 = $12 per day.

Next, we need to consider the total hours Melissa spends on jury duty. She works for 6 hours each day for three days, totaling 6 * 3 = 18 hours.

Finally, to calculate her hourly pay after expenses, we divide her net daily earnings by the total hours worked: $12 / 18 = $0.67 per hour.

"Let's analyze the situation.  Jim's college degree will increase his earning potential significantly.  We need to determine the time it takes for him to recoup the cost of his education and the income he would have earned during that time.

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim will earn from his degree.  He will earn $75,000 per year for four years, totaling $300,000.

Next, we need to consider the amount of money he lost by not working during his four years of college.  He would have earned $25,000 per year during that time, totaling $100,000.

Finally, we need to determine the total amount of money he needs to earn to cover his loan payments and lost income.  This is $200,000 (loan payments) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

To reach this goal, it will take Jim 300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years.

"The question presents a straightforward application of basic geometry.  To determine the fabric needed, we must first determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces.  The problem states that the fabric pieces are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  

Therefore, the fabric pieces are 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.  

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width.  The area of the bed is 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  

The area of each fabric piece is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

To find the total area of fabric needed, we multiply the area of each piece by the number of pieces.  Jim needs two pieces, so he needs 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday.

* **Monday:** 425 letters
* **Tuesday:**  We know they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery.  
* **Wednesday:** They delivered 5 more than twice the number delivered on Tuesday.

To solve this, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

**Tuesday's delivery:** One-fifth of Monday's delivery is 425 / 5 = 85 letters. They delivered 17 more than that, so they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

**Wednesday's delivery:** Twice the number delivered on Tuesday is 102 * 2 = 204 letters. They delivered 5 more than that, so they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

**Total delivery:** The post office delivered 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"The question presents a straightforward calculation of height differences.  

To determine the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights, we must first convert their initial heights to inches.  

* Xavier's initial height is 4 feet, which is equal to 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.
* Xavier then grows 3 inches, increasing his height to 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches.
* Cole's initial height is 50 inches.
* Cole grows 2 inches, increasing his height to 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches.
* The difference between Cole's and Xavier's heights is 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height is 1 inch.

"Let's break down this problem using a legal framework.  

We can represent the shares as follows:

* **Let 'x' be the amount the first person received.**
* **The second person received x + $80.**
* **The third person received 2(x + $80).**

We know the total amount is $1920, and we need to find the first person's share.  

To do this, we can set up an equation based on the principle of equal distribution:

(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

Simplifying the equation:

(4x + $160) / 3 = $1920

Now, we can solve for 'x':

* Multiply both sides by 3: 4x + $160 = $5760
* Subtract $160 from both sides: 4x = $5600
* Divide both sides by 4: x = $1400

Therefore, the first person received $1400.

"The question presents a scenario involving work hours and requires us to determine the individual work hours for each painter.  

To solve this, we need to consider the total work time and the number of painters involved.  

**Here's how we can approach the problem:**

1. **Calculate total work time:** The problem states the team worked for 3/8th of a day each day for 3 weeks.  We need to convert this to hours. 
2. **Convert to hours:**  We know there are 24 hours in a day.  Therefore, 3/8th of a day is equal to (3/8) * 24 = 9/2 hours.
3. **Calculate hours per painter:**  We know the team worked for 9/2 hours over 3 weeks, and there are 4 painters.  Therefore, each painter worked (9/2) / 4 = 9/8 hours.

**Answer:** 9/8 hours.

To solve this, let's use a variable to represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set. We can represent this as 'x'.

* **First set:** Rory retrieved x + 4 balls.
* **Third set:** Rory retrieved x/2 balls.

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of these three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. Combine like terms: (5/2)x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
3. Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.

To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we can use the information that the first set had four more balls than the second set:

* First set: x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10


**Answer:** Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"The car's value depreciates by a fixed percentage each year.  To find the value in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

**Here's how to calculate the depreciation:**

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.


**Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is $9875.**

"James' insurance premium has increased due to the accident.  To determine the annual cost, we need to consider the monthly premium and the number of months in a year. 

The normal monthly premium is $120.  The accident has increased the premium by 60%.  Therefore, his new monthly premium is $120 + (60/100)* $120 = $192.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly premium by 12: $192 * 12 = $2304.

"Let's analyze the given information. We know that Betsy and Donovan collaborated on a meal preparation, and the total time taken was 98 minutes.  We are also informed that Betsy's portion of the meal took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's.  

To determine the duration of Betsy's portion, we can set up an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the time Donovan spent on the meal.
* Betsy's portion took 'x + 18' minutes.

The total time for both portions combined is 98 minutes. Therefore:

* x + (x + 18) = 98

Simplifying the equation:

* 2x + 18 = 98

Solving for 'x':

* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Donovan spent 40 minutes on the meal.  

To find Betsy's portion, we add 18 minutes to Donovan's time:

* Betsy's portion = x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

* **Total Postage Cost:** The total postage cost is $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial order:** Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
* **Mark's consumption:** Mark ate 4 of these sandwiches, leaving 7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches.
* **Final order:** Sidney ordered 3 more sandwiches, bringing the total to 3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches.
* **Total meatballs:** 6 sandwiches * 4 meatballs/sandwich = 24 meatballs.

Therefore, there were **24** meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches.

"The problem presents a straightforward calculation.  We know that 20 trucks were dispatched, and 5 of them experienced mechanical failures.  This means 15 trucks successfully delivered the fertilizer.  To find the total tons delivered, we multiply the number of successful deliveries by the weight of each truck: 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons. 

**Answer:** 300

"The question presents a simple economic scenario.  To determine the cost of the butter, we need to consider the price per pound and the quantity of butter required. 

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter, and the price per pound is $4.00.  The promotion offers a 50% discount on the purchase of one pound of butter.  

Therefore, the cost of the butter will be $4.00 * 6 pounds - $4.00 * 0.50 = $24.00 - $2.00 = $22.00.

"Let's break down the cost of Kayla's party.  

The fee for renting the theater is a fixed amount, $125, regardless of the number of guests.  The additional cost is determined by the number of guests over the initial 20.  

The total cost is calculated as follows:

* **Base Fee:** $125
* **Additional Guests:** 41 guests - 20 initial guests = 21 additional guests
* **Cost of Additional Guests:** 21 guests * $6/guest = $126
* **Total Cost:** $125 + $126 = $251

**Therefore, the total cost of the party is $251.**

"The question presents a scenario involving the expenditure of funds by two individuals, Maggie and Riza.  To determine the remaining amount of money they possess, we must first calculate the total amount spent by each individual. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Maggie's Spending:**  We are given that Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is represented as 1/4 of her initial amount.
* **Riza's Spending:** Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which is represented as 1/3 of her initial amount.

**Solution:**

To find the remaining amount, we must first calculate the total amount spent by both individuals. 

* **Total Spending:**  The total amount spent by both individuals is the sum of their individual spending.

**Final Answer:**

The remaining amount of money they have is the difference between their initial amount and their total spending.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Mr. Robles has 315 bananas and three monkeys.  The first two monkeys eat a total of 20 bananas each day.  The third monkey eats the remaining bananas.  

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats, we need to figure out how many bananas are left after the first two monkeys eat their share.  

The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, which is 315 - 20 = 295 bananas. 

Therefore, the third monkey eats 295 bananas each day.

"The question presents a straightforward scenario.  Teddy completed two separate puzzle sets, totaling 500 pieces each.  Therefore, he placed a total of 500 + 500 = 1000 pieces during the hour. 

**Answer:** 1000

"The problem presents a legal conundrum.  It appears that Jenny is attempting to make a purchase that exceeds her available funds.  A legal transaction requires a valid exchange of value, and in this case, the amount of money she has is insufficient to cover the cost of the roses.  Therefore, the transaction cannot be completed.

"To determine Terry's total earnings, we must calculate the revenue generated from each item and then sum those amounts. 

* **Milkshakes:**  Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, resulting in a revenue of 6 * $5.50 = $33.00.
* **Burger Platters:** He sells 9 platters at $11 each, generating a revenue of 9 * $11 = $99.00.
* **Sodas:** Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, resulting in a revenue of 20 * $1.50 = $30.00.

Finally, we add these individual revenues to find Terry's total earnings: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00. 


Therefore, Terry's total earnings are $162.00.

"Let's analyze the train schedule to determine Paul's total waiting time.

* **First train:** Arrives at 10 minutes past the hour and remains for 20 minutes.
* **Second train:** Arrives 30 minutes after the first train, leaving for 10 minutes.
* **Third train:** Arrives 60 minutes after the first train, departing immediately.
* **Fourth train:** Arrives 20 minutes after the third train, which is the train Paul needs.

To calculate the total waiting time, we need to add the time spent waiting for each train. 

**Therefore, Paul will wait for a total of 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 60 minutes.**

"The problem presents a classic scenario involving a division of property.  We need to determine the amount of fence remaining for Sam. 

Let's break it down:

* **Understanding the Problem:**  Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  Harry is allocated a portion of the fence that is 60 feet greater than Sam's share. 
* **Defining Variables:**  We can represent Sam's portion of the fence with the variable 'x'.  Harry's portion is then 'x + 60'.
* **The Equation:** The total length of fencing must equal 100 feet.  Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 60) = 100.
* **Solving for 'x':**  Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.  Subtracting 60 from both sides, we have 2x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 20.
* **Determining Sam's Share:** Sam has 20 feet of fencing.
* **Calculating Harry's Share:** Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fencing.
* **Calculating Leftover Fence for Sam:**  Sam has 100 - 80 = 20 feet of fencing left.


**Answer:** Sam has 20 feet of fencing left.

"Let's break down the problem to determine Marcel's earnings. 

We know Marcel sells three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking.  

* **MTB:**  The price is $500.
* **BMX:**  The price is half that of an MTB, so it's $500 / 2 = $250.
* **Trekking:** The price is $450.

We are given that Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes.  

* **Trekking:** 150 bikes were Trekking bikes.
* **BMX:** 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, which is 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
* **MTB:** The remaining bikes were MTB bikes, so 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

To calculate Marcel's total earnings, we need to consider the revenue generated from each type of bike:

* **MTB:** 105 MTB bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
* **BMX:** 45 BMX bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* **Trekking:** 150 bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

Finally, we add up the earnings from each type to get Marcel's total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500.


 
**Answer:** $70,500

"Let's break down the problem. John has an additional 2 classes, each lasting 40 minutes, totaling 80 minutes per day.  He attends these classes 5 days a week, resulting in 400 minutes of class time per week.  

He then dedicates 1/16 of his weekly learning time to extra learning on Saturday and Sunday, which equates to 30 minutes per week.  

Finally, we need to determine the total weekly learning time.  This is the sum of his class time and his extra learning time, which is 480 minutes.  

Converting this to hours, we get 510 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 8.5 hours.

**Answer:** 10.67 feet 
"
"Let's break down the problem.  We are given the heights of four children.  We need to determine the height of the fourth child.

* **First child:** 6 feet
* **Second child:** Two inches taller than the first, so 6 feet + 2 inches = 6 feet 2 inches
* **Third child:** 5 inches shorter than the second, so 6 feet 2 inches - 5 inches = 6 feet 7 inches
* **Fourth child:** Three inches taller than the third, so 6 feet 7 inches + 3 inches = 6 feet 10 inches

**Therefore, the fourth child is 6 feet 10 inches tall.**

"Let's break down this scenario logically.  We know the Allosaurus consumed the final 270 kilograms of meat.  This implies that the T-Rex consumed half of the remaining meat after the velociraptors had their share.  

To determine the original amount of meat on the triceratops, we need to consider the following:

* **The T-Rex's portion:** The Allosaurus consumed the remaining meat, meaning the T-Rex ate half of what was left after the velociraptors had their share.
* **The velociraptors' portion:** The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left after the T-Rex had their share.

Therefore, the triceratops had 270 kilograms of meat remaining after the T-Rex ate half of it. 

**Answer:** 270 kilograms.

"The question presents a straightforward application of basic geometry and cost analysis.  To determine the cost of painting the room, we must first calculate the total area of the walls and then determine the number of gallons of paint required. 

The area of each wall is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.  The total area of the four walls is the sum of the areas of the north and south walls, and the east and west walls.  

The cost of paint is determined by multiplying the number of gallons of paint by the price per gallon. 

**Therefore, the total cost of painting the room is $72.**

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to consider the total number of people arriving in vehicles and then subtract the number of people already present. 

**Here's how to approach the problem:**

1. **Identify the source of the people:** The question states that there were 20 private cars and 12 buses. 
2. **Determine the number of people arriving by car:** Each car carries 3 people, and there are 20 cars. Therefore, 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people arrived by car.
3. **Determine the number of people arriving by bus:** Each bus carries 35 people, and there are 12 buses. Therefore, 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people arrived by bus.
4. **Calculate the total number of people arriving:** 60 people (by car) + 420 people (by bus) = 480 people.

**Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is 480.**

"The question asks for the total time Bobby spends on lunches and breaks over five days.  

Let's break down the calculation:

* **Lunch time:** 30 minutes per day
* **Break time:** 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes per day
* **Total daily time:** 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes per day
* **Total time over 5 days:** 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

**Therefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours over five days.**

"Let's break down this problem using a legal framework.  We can approach this as a system of equations, where each variable represents a quantity. 

* **Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline painted.**
* **Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.**

We are given the following information:

1. **Joint Effort:** Arnold and Madeline painted a combined total of 56 eggs. This translates to 2x, representing their combined effort.
2. **Camden and Sarah's Partnership:** Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. This translates to y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12, representing their combined effort.
3. **Total Eggs:** The total number of eggs painted is 2x + (2y + 12) = 56.

**Solving for the Variables:**

We can solve for 'x' and 'y' using the given information. 

* **From the first equation, we know that 2x = 56 - 2y.**
* **Substituting this into the second equation, we get:** y + (y + 12) = 2(56 - 2y) + 12
* **Simplifying the equation:** y + y + 12 = 112 - 4y + 12
* **Combining like terms:** 2y + 12 = 124
* **Solving for 'y':** 2y = 112
* **Therefore, y = 56.**

**Determining the Difference:**

Now that we know y (the number of eggs Sarah painted), we can find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs. 

* **Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 56 + 12 = 68 eggs.**
* **The difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs is 68 - 11 = 57.**


**Answer:** Camden painted 57 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given two pieces of information:

1. Bob initially had a certain number of marbles.
2. After receiving 2 dozen more marbles, he has 60 marbles.

This tells us that the initial number of marbles is represented by the variable 'x'.  We can use this information to find the value of 'x'.

We are also told that Bob loses 10 marbles. This means we need to subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles to find the final number.

**Therefore, the final number of marbles Bob has is x - 10.**

**To find the value of 'x', we can use the second piece of information:**

* Bob has 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. 
* 2 dozen is equal to 2 * 12 = 24 marbles.
* Therefore, x + 24 = 60

**Solving for x:**

"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we need to consider the total number of reports received over the week and the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, as well as Thursday and Friday. 

The total number of reports received is 5168.  We know that Monday and Tuesday combined totaled 1907 reports, and Thursday and Friday totaled 2136 reports.  

Subtracting the total reports received on Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday from the total number of reports received, we can find the number of reports received on Wednesday. 

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 5168 - 1907 - 2136 = 1125.

"Let's break down the transaction to determine Abraham's earnings. 

* **Initial Land:** Abraham possesses 80 square meters of land.
* **First Sale:** He sells half of his land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters. This sale generates $50.
* **Second Sale:** He sells 1/4 of the remaining land, which is 80 / 4 = 20 square meters. This sale yields $30.
* **Final Sale:**  He sells the remaining land, which is 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters. This sale generates $60.

**Therefore, Abraham will earn a total of $50 + $30 + $60 = $140 from the sale of his land.**

We are given the following information:

* Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
* Lamar found 5 eggs.
* Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 2 * 5 = 10 eggs.
* Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
* Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  

We are given that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  We are also told that the combined length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.  

To solve for the length of the red rope, we need to find the length of the yellow rope first.  

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
*  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
*  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

**Set up an equation:**

The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12  (The length of the yellow rope)

**Find the length of the red rope:**

* Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach. 

We are given that Ronnie received $5 and Rissa received thrice that amount, meaning Rissa received $15.  

We are also told that after each of them gave an equal amount to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money remaining. This implies that Rissa gave away a portion of her money, and the remaining amount represents the value of that portion.

To determine the amount Rissa gave away, we can use the information that she has 4/5 of her money left.  

Let's represent the amount Rissa gave away as 'x'.  We can set up an equation:

(1 - 4/5) * $15 = $x

Simplifying the equation:

(1/5) * $15 = $x

Therefore, Rissa gave away $3.

Now, we can determine the amount Ronnie gave away.  Since they gave the same amount to their sister, we can say that Ronnie gave away $3 as well.

Finally, we can determine the amount of money Ronnie has left.  

**Answer:** $2

"The question presents a straightforward calculation of the total area of Tom's house.  

To find the total area, we must first determine the area of each bedroom and the living room.  

* **Bedrooms:** Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one bedroom is 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.  Since Tom has four bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 bedrooms * 240 square feet/bedroom = 960 square feet.
* **Living Room:** The living room is 5 times larger than a bedroom, so its area is 240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet.
* **Total Area:** The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of the bedrooms and the living room, plus the area of the rest of the house.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  Therefore, the total area of the house is 960 square feet + 1200 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem. Alice's cloud counting is a simple arithmetic sequence.  We need to find the sum of a geometric series. 

* **First term (a):** Alice counts 3 puffs on Monday.
* **Common ratio (r):** The number of puffs doubles each day, so the common ratio is 2.
* **Number of terms (n):**  Alice counts for 5 days.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is: 
S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Plugging in our values:
S = 3 (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 (-31) / (-1)
S = 93

Therefore, Alice will have counted a total of **93** puffs across all five days.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.  

First, we need to determine the initial number of bills Thomas had.  He withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, so he had 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

Next, he loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

He then uses half of the remaining bills to pay a bill, leaving him with 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

After this, he triples his money, which means he now has 20 * 3 = 60.

Finally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount of money he has by the value of each bill: 60 / 5 = 12.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total number of goals scored in the match.

**First Half:**

* Team A scores 4 goals.
* Team B scores 2 fewer goals than Team A, meaning they score 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

**Second Half:**

* Team B scores 4 times the number of goals from the first half, so they score 2 * 4 = 8 goals.
* Team A scores 1/4 of team B's goals, meaning they score 8 * (1/4) = 2 goals.

**Total Goals:**

* The total number of goals scored in the match is 4 + 2 + 8 + 2 = 16.

**Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16.**

"Mr. Marcellus is entitled to a refund for the spoiled milk.  The company is obligated to refund the purchase price of the milk that was returned due to spoilage.  

To calculate the refund amount, we need to determine the total cost of the milk purchased and the amount of milk that was returned. 

**The total cost of the milk was $14,000.  The amount of milk returned was 1600 gallons.  The refund amount is calculated as follows:**

**Refund Amount = Total Cost - (Spoiled Milk Quantity * Price per Gallon)**

**Refund Amount = $14,000 - (1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon)**

**Refund Amount = $14,000 - $5,600**

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach. 

We are given two statements about the ages of Wendy and Colin.  

* **Statement 1:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
* **Statement 2:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

These statements can be translated into equations:

* **Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""**
* **Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""**

**From Statement 1:**
* W = 5(C + 7) 

**From Statement 2:**
* C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 5 = (5/3)C
   * (2/3)C = 5
   * C = 25/2

"The problem presents a straightforward application of basic arithmetic.  We are given that Bob has a total of $27,000 to distribute among three schools for the purchase of books.  Each school receives $9,000, and he can purchase 100 books for $500.  To determine the number of books each school can purchase, we must consider the following:

* **Cost per book:** $500
* **Total funds per school:** $9,000
* **Books per school:** $9,000 / $500 = 18 books

Therefore, Bob can purchase 18 books per school.

"The question presents a series of actions involving the manipulation of apples.  To determine the number of apples Newton brought home, we must analyze the sequence of events.  

**The key is to focus on the apples that were brought into Newton's possession.**  

Let's break down the process:

1. **Initial Apples:**  Two apples fall from the tree.
2. **First Throw:** One apple is kept, one is thrown back into the tree, causing five more to fall.
3. **Second Throw:** Six more apples fall from the tree.
4. **Final Count:** Newton picks up all the apples, bringing home the remaining apples.

**Therefore, the number of apples Newton brought home is 10.**

"The cost of Ali's coal order is determined by the number of bags purchased and the price per bag.  

To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the number of bags needed to accommodate the 850 kilos of coal.  

* 850 kilos / 50 kilos per bag = 17 bags

The cost of each bag is $18. Therefore, the total cost of the order is:

* 17 bags * $18/bag = $306

"To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to purchase, we must first determine the total number of slices consumed.  

* **Cheese Pizza:** Kate consumes 6 slices per friend * 6 friends = 36 slices of cheese pizza.
* **Pepperoni Pizza:** Kate consumes 4 slices per friend * 6 friends = 24 slices of pepperoni pizza.
* **Total Slices:** Kate consumes 36 slices of cheese pizza + 24 slices of pepperoni pizza = 60 slices.

To determine the number of pizza pies, we must divide the total number of slices consumed by the number of slices per pizza.

* **Cheese Pizza:** 60 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 5 cheese pizzas.
* **Pepperoni Pizza:** 60 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas.

Since you cannot purchase half a pizza, Kate needs to purchase 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas. 


**Answer:** 6 cheese pizzas and 8 pepperoni pizzas.

"The question presents a scenario involving a time-dependent process.  To determine the time it takes for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds and melts snowballs. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Building Rate:** Jay builds snowballs at a rate of 1/3 snowball per minute.
* **Melting Rate:**  He melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes.

**Solution:**

To find the time it takes to reach 60 snowballs, we need to consider the net change in snowballs over time.  

1. **Initial State:** Jay starts with 0 snowballs.
2. **Building:**  He builds snowballs at a rate of 1/3 per minute.
3. **Melting:** He melts snowballs at a rate of 2/15 per minute.

**Determining the Time:**

To find the time it takes to reach 60 snowballs, we need to determine the time it takes to build 60 snowballs. 

**Therefore, the answer is 60 minutes.**

"Let's break down this problem using the principles of age and time.  

We know that John's age is 28, and we need to determine Jim's age.  

The key is to understand that the age difference between John and Jim is a constant.  

* **John's age:** 28
* **John's age 20 years ago:** 28 - 20 = 8
* **Jim's age 20 years ago:** 8 

Therefore, Jim was 8 years old when Digimon was released. 


**Answer:** Jim is 8 years old.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are asked to determine the total number of apple slices consumed by Doxa, her sister, and her brother. 

* **Doxa's slices:**  We are given that Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces.
* **Sister's slices:**  The sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, meaning she ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.
* **Brother's slices:** The brother ate 1 more slice than the sister, meaning he ate 1 + 2 = 3 slices.

To find the total number of slices consumed, we add the number of slices each person ate: 8 (Doxa's slices) + 2 (sister's slices) + 3 (brother's slices) = 13 slices.

"To determine the initial number of bandages, we need to consider the bandages used and the bandages remaining at the end of the third day. 

Let's break down the information:

* **Day 1:** The nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack.
* **Day 2:** They used 10 fewer bandages than day 1, meaning they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.
* **Day 3:** They ordered two bulk packs and used half of one pack, leaving 50 bandages. 
* **Total bandages used:** 38 + 28 + 50 = 116 bandages
* **Total bandages remaining:** 78 bandages.

We can now solve for the initial number of bandages. 

**Answer:** 194

"The cost of May's haircut and coloring services can be determined by calculating the cost of the haircut and then adding the cost of the coloring. 

The cost of the haircut is calculated by multiplying the number of inches of hair cut by the price per inch.  The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, and May's hair was 10 inches long, so the cost of the haircut is $30 * 10 = $300. 

The cost of the coloring is $40.  Therefore, the total cost of the haircut and coloring is $300 + $40 = $340.

"Let's break down Jen's earnings.  

First, we need to determine her weekly earnings from her regular work. She works 7.5 hours per day for 6 days a week, resulting in a daily wage of $11.25.  

Next, we need to consider her attendance bonus. She receives an additional $10 for perfect attendance each week.

Finally, we need to calculate her total earnings for the month. 

**Therefore, Jen's total earnings for April are $77.50.**

"Jason's earnings can be calculated by summing the earnings from each task:

* **Dishwasher:** $0.50 per emptying, multiplied by the number of times he emptied the dishwasher (6 times), resulting in $3.00.
* **Laundry:** $3.00 per laundry, multiplied by the number of times he did laundry (1 time), resulting in $3.00.
* **Trash:** $0.75 per trash removal, multiplied by the number of times he took the trash out (2 times), resulting in $1.50.
* **Cleaning:** $1.50 per room, multiplied by the number of times he cleaned his room (1 time), resulting in $1.50.

Adding these amounts together, Jason's total earnings for the two-week period are $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that a whale has 40 gallons of blood.  A shark has three times the blood of a whale, so a shark has 3 * 40 gallons = 120 gallons of blood.  If we have ten sharks, we can calculate the total blood volume by multiplying the blood per shark by the number of sharks: 120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons. 

**Answer:** 1200

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Morning:** 50 people
* **10:00:** 40 more people join, totaling 50 + 40 = 90 people.
* **Lunch:** Twice the number of 10:00 people enter, resulting in 90 * 2 = 180 people.
* **Evening:** Three times the number of morning people enter, totaling 50 * 3 = 150 people.
* **Total:** 50 + 90 + 180 + 150 = 470 people

Therefore, a total of 470 people entered the restaurant that day. 


**Answer:** 470

"To determine the total number of pens Alain possesses, we must first calculate the number of black pens.  Alain's mother purchased twice the number of black pens as red pens, meaning she acquired 5 packs of red pens * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.  

Each pack of pens contains 5 pens, so Alain's mother purchased 10 packs of black pens * 5 pens/pack = 50 black pens.

Finally, we must add the number of red pens to the number of black pens to find the total number of pens Alain possesses. Alain has 5 packs of red pens * 5 pens/pack + 50 black pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens. 


**Answer:** 75

"The question presents a straightforward financial scenario.  We need to determine the total cost of John's purchases. 

First, we need to determine the cost of a single bottle of cognac.  We are given that cognac costs 50% more than scotch, which means the price of cognac is 1.5 times the price of scotch.  

Next, we need to determine the number of bottles of cognac purchased.  The problem states that John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.  

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the cognac and the total cost of all purchases. 


**Answer:** $900

"The question presents a straightforward calculation of the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius.  

Let's break it down:

* **Day 1:** Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that number of Lodgepole Pine, resulting in a total of 60 trees.
* **Day 2:** He planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on Day 1. This means he planted 30 White Oak trees and 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees, totaling 80 trees.

Finally, to find the total number of trees planted in two days, we add the trees planted on each day: 60 + 80 = 140 trees.

**Therefore, Mr. Julius planted a total of 140 trees.**

"The question presents a scenario involving the consumption of a shared resource.  To determine the amount available for consumption, we must first determine the total amount of root beer remaining after the various events. 

Let's break down the consumption:

* **Initial:** Fred had 24 gallons.
* **Children:** 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remaining.
* **Barbie:** 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining.
* **Ronnie:** 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remaining.

Finally, we must divide the remaining root beer by the number of people attending the party. 

**Answer:** 8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

"Let's analyze the problem. We are given a statement: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40.""  This translates to an algebraic equation: 4x + 8 = 40.  

To solve for the number of coffee mugs, we need to isolate 'x'.  Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get 4x = 32.  Dividing both sides by 4, we find that x = 8. 

Therefore, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Let's break down the problem. We are asked to determine the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes. 

* **Step 1: Determine the number of fish with red stripes.**  One-third of the total fish have red stripes, so we need to calculate that. 
   * (1/3) * 66 fish = 22 fish

* **Step 2: Determine the number of fish that do not have red stripes.**  We can find this by subtracting the number of red-striped fish from the total number of fish.
   * 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish

* **Step 3: Determine the number of fish with blue stripes.**  We are given that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   * (5/11) * 44 fish = 20 fish

* **Step 4: Determine the total number of fish with red and blue stripes.**  We add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.
   * 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish

"The question presents a straightforward calculation.  We are asked to determine the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.  

* **First floor height:** The first floor is 3 times Mattisson's height, which is 60 inches.  
* **Second floor height:** The second floor is 7 times Mattisson's height, which is 60 inches.
* **Roof height:** The roof is the height of the second floor minus the height of the first floor.  

Therefore, the roof is 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches high. 


**Answer:** 240

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach.  

We know the total number of shells is 700.  We also know that Alphas found 40% of the shells, and The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells.  To find the number of shells found by Gogetters, we need to consider the remaining shells after Alphas and The Finders have found their share.

**Therefore, the number of shells found by Gogetters is the difference between the total number of shells and the shells found by Alphas and The Finders.**

"The question presents a straightforward financial scenario.  John secured a loan of 40% of his home's value, which is $100,000.  He then used 60% of this loan to pay off his existing debts.  

To determine the remaining amount after debt repayment, we need to calculate the amount remaining after the debt is paid.  

The remaining amount is $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000. 


**Answer:** $40,000

"The question presents a straightforward economic calculation.  To determine Deandre's earnings, we need to consider the total weight of the tunas and the price per kilogram. 

The total weight of the tunas is 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.  

The price per kilogram is $0.50.  Therefore, Deandre will earn 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00.

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the difference between her selling price and the cost price of the magazines. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price, which is $72.  

Therefore, the selling price is (11/8) * $72 = $99.

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is $99 - $72 = $27.

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier over a period of time.

* **Low Setting:** The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  Over 3 days, it removes 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.
* **Medium Setting:** The medium setting removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 liter/day * 2 = 2 liters/day. Over 3 days, it removes 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.
* **High Setting:** The high setting removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 liters/day * 2 = 4 liters/day. Over 5 days, it removes 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 30 liters.


**Answer:** 30 liters

"The question presents a scenario involving a legal concept known as ""estimation"" in the context of a competition.  

To determine the error in Tim's guess, we need to analyze the relationship between the volume of the jar, the volume of the jelly beans, and the percentage of red jelly beans. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Volume:** The volume of the jar is crucial as it determines the potential space for the jelly beans.
* **Packing Efficiency:** This factor is important as it dictates how efficiently the jelly beans are packed within the jar.
* **Red Jelly Beans:** The percentage of red jelly beans is a critical factor in determining the actual number of red jelly beans.

**Analysis:**

1. **Volume of the Jar:** The volume of the jar is calculated as 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.
2. **Volume of Jelly Beans:** The volume of the jelly beans is calculated as 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.
3. **Number of Jelly Beans:** The number of jelly beans is calculated as 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.
4. **Difference:** The difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number is 900 - 2880 * 0.30 = 900 - 864 = 36.

**Conclusion:**

Tim's estimate was 36 jelly beans off.

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the number of passengers needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus. 

* **Step 1: Initial Passengers** The bus begins with 20 passengers.
* **Step 2: Passengers After First Stop**  40 passengers enter the bus, bringing the total to 20 + 40 = 60 passengers.
* **Step 3: Passengers After Second Stop** 3/4 of the passengers from the first stop (40) enter the bus, resulting in 40 * (3/4) = 30 passengers. The total number of passengers at the second stop is 60 + 30 = 90 passengers.
* **Step 4: Passengers After Third Stop** The bus's capacity is 200, and the current passenger count is 90.  The bus has doubled its passenger count, meaning there are 90 * 2 = 180 passengers.
* **Step 5: Passengers Remaining** The bus has 180 passengers and a capacity of 200, leaving 200 - 180 = 20 passengers to fill.

"
"Let's break down this problem.  We know the board is 40 feet long and we need to find the length of the longer piece.  

The longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece.  

To find the length of the shorter piece, we can set up an equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.
*  The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4x.
*  The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces: x + 4x = 40 feet.
*  Combining like terms: 5x = 40 feet.
*  Dividing both sides by 5: x = 8 feet.

Therefore, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. 

The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

"To determine the amount of fabric Luke needs, we must first calculate the total width of the windows.  He has five windows, each measuring 35 inches wide, so the total width is 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.  

To ensure he has enough fabric, Luke needs to purchase twice the total window width.  Therefore, he should buy 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches of fabric. 


**Answer:** 350 inches

"The cost of a 36-minute call would be determined by the price per minute for the first 16 minutes and the price per minute for the remaining 20 minutes. 

The first 16 minutes would cost $0.25 per minute, totaling $4.00. 

The remaining 20 minutes would cost $0.20 per minute, totaling $4.00.

Therefore, the total cost of the call would be $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00.

"The problem presents a straightforward calculation.  We are given that on Monday, 2 inches of rain fell.  On Tuesday, the expected rainfall is one inch more than twice the amount of rain from Monday.  

To find the total rainfall on Tuesday, we can calculate:

* Twice the amount of rain on Monday: 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches
* One inch more than twice the amount of Monday's rain: 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches

Therefore, there will be **5 inches** of rain on Tuesday.

"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Carly makes a certain number of cupcakes and brownies for her art class.  We are also given that the number of brownies is related to the number of cupcakes by a specific formula.  

We need to determine the number of cupcakes Carly made.  

**Here's how we can approach this:**

1. **Define Variables:** Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes and 'b' represent the number of brownies.

2. **Formulate the Relationship:** We know that the number of brownies is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes. This can be expressed as an equation:  b = 3c - 2.

3. **Consider the Total Treats:** The total number of treats is 10.  Since each person gets 2 treats, we can set up an equation: 2(c + b) = 10.

4. **Solve for 'c':** We can now solve for 'c' by substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation into the second equation: 2(c + (3c - 2)) = 10. Simplifying and solving for 'c' will give us the number of cupcakes.

"Let's analyze the situation. Karen is seeking a manicure and pedicure, and the salon offers a 20% discount on both services when purchased together.  

First, we need to calculate the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure.  The price of the manicure is $35, and the discount is 20% of that price, which is $35 * 0.20 = $7.  Therefore, the discounted price of the manicure is $35 - $7 = $28.  The price of the pedicure is $40, and the discount is 20% of that price, which is $40 * 0.20 = $8.  Therefore, the discounted price of the pedicure is $40 - $8 = $32.  

Next, we need to consider the cost of nail art.  Karen wants nail art on each of her 10 nails, and the cost is $3 per nail, so the total cost of nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

Finally, we need to add the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure, plus the cost of nail art to find the total cost.  The total cost is $28 + $32 + $30 = $90.

"Let's break down the problem. Susan has three magazines that each send 12 issues per year.  She also has one magazine that sends 6 issues per year.  Finally, there's another magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine.  

To find the total number of magazines, we need to consider the number of issues from each magazine. 

* **Total issues from the 12-issue magazines:** 3 magazines * 12 issues/magazine = 36 issues
* **Total issues from the 6-issue magazine:** 1 magazine * 6 issues/magazine = 6 issues
* **Total issues from the 4-issue magazine:** 1 magazine * 4 * 6 issues/magazine = 24 issues

**Total issues:** 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues. 


**Answer:** 66

"Let's break down this problem using a logical approach. 

We are given that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.  We are also given that Samantha has 27 paintings.  

To solve for Kim's number of paintings, we can use a series of algebraic steps. 

**Let's represent the unknown:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

**Formulate the equations:**

* Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim: Shelley = x + 8
* Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley: Samantha = Shelley - 12 = (x + 8) - 12 = x - 4
* Samantha has 27 paintings: x - 4 = 27

**Solve for x:**

* Add 4 to both sides of the equation: x = 31

**Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.**

"To calculate the mean score, we must first sum all the scores provided.  

The sum of the scores is 570.  

Next, we divide this sum by the total number of scores, which is 9. 

Therefore, the mean score is 570 / 9 = 63.33.

"To determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, we need to consider the relationship between the number of novels she wrote last year and the number she has written this year.  

We know that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this represents 3/4 of the novels she has written this year.  

Let's represent the total number of novels Regina has written this year as ""x"".  We can set up an equation:

* 9 (last year's novels) = (3/4) * x (this year's novels)

Solving for x:

* 9 = (3/4) * x
* 9 * (4/3) = x
* 12 = x

Therefore, Regina has written **12** novels this year.

"The question presents a straightforward scenario requiring a simple calculation.  To determine the number of bookcases needed, we must first determine the total capacity of each shelf.  

* **Bottom shelf:** Holds twice the capacity of a middle shelf, meaning it holds 20 books.
* **Top shelf:** Holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, meaning it holds 15 books.
* **Middle shelves:**  Each middle shelf holds 10 books.

The total capacity of all shelves is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To determine the number of bookcases required, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of each shelf: 110 books / 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Red hats:**  Skyler has 100 hats, and half are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.
* **Remaining hats:**  After removing the red hats, Skyler has 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.
* **Blue hats:**  3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, which is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
* **White hats:**  The remaining hats are the ones that are white, and there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

**Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.**

"The question presents a simple cost-per-unit calculation.  To determine the cost per stick of jerky, we must first determine the price per stick. 

The price of the bag of jerky is $18.00, and the bag contains 30 sticks.  Therefore, the price per stick is $18.00 / 30 sticks = $0.60 per stick. 

To express this in cents, we multiply the price per stick by 100: $0.60 * 100 cents/dollar = 60 cents. 

**Answer:** 60 cents

"The question presents a scenario involving a legal concept known as ""passing requirements.""  To determine the number of questions Audrey must answer correctly on the second test, we must consider the overall passing standard. 

The question states that Audrey must achieve a 70% success rate on both tests combined to advance to the 7th grade.  

Let's break down the information:

* **Test 1:** 70 questions, 60% correct.
* **Test 2:** 40 questions.

To determine the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test, we need to consider the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to meet the 70% passing standard. 

**Therefore, Audrey needs to answer 28 questions correctly on the second test to pass.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes, and we know the number of blueberry cubes is related to the number of strawberry cubes.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes with the variable 'x'.  The number of blueberry cubes is then represented by 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  

We can set up an equation to represent this:

* x + (5x - 4) = 116

Now, we can solve for 'x':

* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is then:

* 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

**Answer: 96**

"To calculate the total points scored, we need to consider the number of games played and the points scored per game.  

* **Games played:** Ara played 40 games per year for four years.
* **Points per game:** She scored 21 points per game.

Therefore, the total points scored is:

* **Total points = (Games played per year) * (Points per game)**
* **Total points = 40 games/year * 21 points/game * 4 years**
* **Total points = 3360 points**

"Jason's sales goal is a straightforward calculation.  He needs to make enough calls to generate a certain number of potential customers who will then convert into sales.  

Let's break it down:

* **Conversion Rate:**  Jason needs to convert 1 customer into a sale for every 2 customers who visit the dealership.
* **Target Sales:** He needs to sell 15 cars.

To determine the number of calls required, we need to consider the conversion rate and the number of customers he needs to convert. 

**Therefore, Jason needs to make 188 telephone calls to achieve his sales goal.**

"The question presents a scenario involving the allocation of both flashlights and candles.  We must first determine the total number of flashlights and candles in the scenario. 

**Flashlights:** There are 4 people in the house, and each person requires one flashlight, resulting in a total of 4 flashlights.

**Candles:** The number of candles is determined by the number of rooms and the type of candles used.  The question states that there are 8 rooms in the house.  Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each.  Therefore, the total number of candles is 8 small candles + 8 medium candles = 16 candles.

**Total:** The total number of flashlights and candles is 4 flashlights + 16 candles = 20.

"The time it takes to solve a Rubik's Cube is determined by the time it takes to complete each individual side.  

Let's break down the process:

* **First side:** 5 minutes
* **Second and third sides:** Each side takes twice as long as the first, so 5 minutes * 2 = 10 minutes each.
* **Last two sides:** Each side takes half as long as the first, so 5 minutes / 2 = 2.5 minutes each. 
* **Total time:** 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30 minutes.

**Therefore, the total time to solve the Rubik's Cube is 30 minutes.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Dominick observed half the number of robots as helmets, and half the number of helmets as footballs.  We are also given that there were 20 helmets.  

To find the total number of items, we need to consider the relationship between the number of helmets and the number of robots, and the number of helmets and the number of footballs. 

* **Helmets and Robots:**  We know there were 20 helmets, and half the number of robots is equal to 20 helmets / 2 = 10 robots.
* **Helmets and Footballs:**  We also know there were 20 helmets, and half the number of footballs is equal to 20 helmets / 2 = 10 footballs.

Therefore, Dominick observed a total of 10 robots + 10 footballs = 20 items.

"The question asks for the difference in drying time for six paintings using the new varnish compared to the old varnish.  

To determine this, we need to calculate the total drying time for six paintings using the new varnish.  The drying time for one painting is 12 minutes.  Therefore, the total drying time for six paintings is 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

Finally, we need to determine the difference in drying time between the two methods. The drying time for six paintings using the old varnish is 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.  The difference in drying time is 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.


**Answer:** 30 minutes

"To determine the total water needed, we must first identify the number of plants requiring each amount of water.  

* **Half-cup plants:** 4 plants require half a cup of water.
* **One-cup plants:** 8 plants require one cup of water.
* **Quarter-cup plants:** The remaining 8 plants require a quarter of a cup of water.

To calculate the total water needed, we sum the water requirements for each group:

* **Total water needed:** 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant + 8 plants * 1 cup/plant + 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups.


**Answer:** 12 cups

"The question presents a straightforward scenario involving distance, speed, and time.  To determine the total time Phineas will take to return home, we must consider the time spent on land and the time spent swimming. 

**Land Travel:**

* Phineas hops 100 yards at a rate of 20 yards per minute. 
* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time (land) = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

**Swimming:**

* Phineas swims 100 yards at a rate of 10 yards per minute.
* Time (swimming) = Distance / Speed
* Time (swimming) = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

**Total Time:**

* Total time = Time (land) + Time (swimming)
* Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

Therefore, Phineas will take **15 minutes** to return home.

"The cost of Bob's project is determined by the number of popsicle sticks he needs and the price per box.  

To calculate the total cost, we need to determine the number of boxes needed to acquire the required popsicle sticks.  Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks, and each box contains 8 sticks.  Therefore, he will need 56 / 8 = 7 boxes.

The cost of these boxes is $2.00 per box, so the total cost will be 7 * $2.00 = $14.00.

"To determine the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we need to calculate the total for the first three days and then add the number of people he saw the rest of the week. 

* **Day 1:** 50 people
* **Day 2:** 50 + 20 = 70 people
* **Day 3:** 70 * 2 = 140 people
* **Total for the first three days:** 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people
* **People seen the rest of the week:** 60 people/day * 5 days = 300 people
* **Total for the week:** 260 + 300 = 560 people

**Answer:** 560

"Let's break down this popcorn problem.  We need to determine the total number of kernels Garrett has after the popping process. 

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial Popping:** Garrett starts with 20 kernels popping in the first 30 seconds.
2. **Increased Popping:** The kernels pop three times faster in the next 30 seconds, resulting in 60 kernels popping.
3. **Further Increase:** The popping rate increases again, this time four times faster, leading to 240 kernels popping in the next 30 seconds.
4. **Final Popping:** The kernels pop at half the rate in the final 30 seconds, resulting in 120 kernels popping.
5. **Residual Popping:**  A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds, or 30 kernels, pop from residual heat.

**Total Popping:**  Adding all the kernels popped, we get 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = 440 kernels.

**Therefore, Garrett has 440 kernels to eat.**

"To determine the total dog food consumption for the week, we need to consider the individual food requirements of each breed and then sum those requirements. 

* **German Shepherds:** 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg
* **Bulldogs:** 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg
* **Total:** 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Therefore, the Kennel will need 21 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"To determine the total number of animal legs on the farm, we need to consider the number of legs on each type of animal. 

* **Two-legged animals:**  We have 10 animals with two legs each, totaling 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
* **Four-legged animals:** We have 15 animals with four legs each, totaling 15 * 4 = 60 legs.

Adding the legs from both types of animals, we get 20 + 60 = 80 legs. 

Therefore, the total number of animal legs on the farm is 80.

"Let's break down the problem. We know the tower has a total of 32 blocks.  We also know there are 4 blue blocks.  The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, meaning there are 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  

Therefore, the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.  We can find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20.

**Answer:** 20

"The question presents a classic scenario involving distance, time, and speed.  To determine the distance from Elvis's house, we need to consider the total distance traveled. 

Let's break it down:

* **Westward Journey:** Elvis travels 90 miles west at a speed of 18 mph.
* **Eastward Journey:** He then travels 144 miles east at the same speed.

To find the total distance, we simply add the distances traveled in each direction: 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is **234 miles** from his house.

"The boat's value depreciates over time.  To determine the final value, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year. 

* **Year 1:** The boat depreciates 30% of its initial value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  The value after depreciation is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  The boat depreciates another 30% of its value from the previous year, which is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.  The value after depreciation is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:** The boat depreciates 20% of its value from the previous year, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882. The value after depreciation is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

We are given that there are 54 red candies, and twice that amount of orange candies, which is 54 * 2 = 108.  We are also told that there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, which is 54 / 2 = 27.  Adding these together, we get 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  Subtracting this total from the total number of candies in the bag, 232, we find that there are 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total cost of Helen's trip. 

* **Hotel Cost:** Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, and each night cost $80. Therefore, the total hotel cost is 3 * $80 = $240.
* **Bus Fare:** Each bus trip cost 10% of the cost of a single night at the hotel, which is $8.  Over the course of 7 trips, the total bus fare is 7 * $8 = $56.
* **Total Cost:**  The total cost of the trip is the sum of the hotel and bus expenses: $240 + $56 = $296.

**Therefore, Helen paid $296 for her trip.**

"Let's break down the problem. We know Dallas received 21 marbles after dropping 4.  To find out how many Mazie gave to Darla, we need to consider the total number of marbles Mazie gave away.  

The key is to subtract the number of marbles Dallas had before dropping any from the total number of marbles Mazie had. 

Therefore, Mazie gave Darla 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

"To determine the amount of crepe paper James needs, we must first understand the concept of perimeter.  The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides added together.  

In this case, James's fence is a rectangle with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet.  Therefore, the perimeter is calculated as follows:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet)
Perimeter = 2 * 35 feet
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs to purchase 70 feet of crepe paper.

"The question presents a simple age difference scenario.  To find the average age, we need to consider the ages of both individuals.  

The question states that Mia is younger than Emma, and we are given that Mia is 40 years old.  To find Emma's age, we can use the given information:

* **Age Difference:** 16 years
* **Mia's Age:** 40 years

Therefore, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56 years.

The average of their ages is (40 + 56) / 2 = 48.

"The question presents a straightforward economic calculation.  To determine the total cost, we must consider the cost of each item and the number of items needed. 

* **Dinner Plates:**  The cost of a dinner plate is $6.00.  We need to determine the total cost for 36 dinner plates.
* **Bowls:** The cost of a bowl is $5.00. We need to determine the total cost for 36 bowls.
* **Salad Plates:** The cost of a salad plate is $4.00. We need to determine the total cost for 36 salad plates.

**Therefore, the total cost of the place settings is $216.00 + $180.00 + $144.00 = $540.00**

"The question presents a straightforward calculation.  To determine the cost of the hot dogs, we need to consider the number of hot dogs needed and the price per pack. 

First, we need to determine the total number of hot dogs John needs to purchase. He is hosting 20 guests and each guest will consume 2 hot dogs, so he needs 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs. 

Next, we need to determine the number of packs of hot dogs he needs to purchase.  He has 4 hot dogs leftover, so he needs to purchase 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Each pack contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, so he needs to purchase 36 / 6 = 6 packs.  The total cost is then 6 * $2 = $12.

"To determine Frances's remaining funds, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract her expenses. 

First, we need to determine her earnings from selling cupcakes and cookies:

* Cupcakes: 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40
* Cookies: 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40
* Total earnings: $40 + $40 = $80

Next, we need to calculate her expenses:

* Trays: 5 trays * $4/tray = $20

Finally, we can determine her remaining funds:

* Total earnings - Total expenses = Remaining funds
* $80 - $20 = $60

Therefore, Frances has $60 left. 


**Answer:** $60

"The question presents a scenario involving a series of additions and subtractions of children.  We need to determine the final number of children following the ice cream truck. 

Let's break down the process:

* **Initial:** 5 children are present.
* **Second Street:** The number of children increases by one, resulting in 6.
* **Third Street:** The number of children increases by two, resulting in 8.
* **Final:** The original group of 5 children leaves, leaving 3 children.

Therefore, the final number of children following the truck is **3**.

"To determine the number of meals remaining, we need to calculate the total meals distributed and then subtract that from the initial number of meals.

"Let's break down the time commitment:

* **Meditation:** Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice daily, totaling 30 minutes per day.  
* **Weekly Meditation:** Over five days, she dedicates 30 minutes/day * 5 days = 150 minutes to meditation.
* **Yoga:** Charisma practices yoga for one hour each day, totaling 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours per week.
* **Total Weekly Time:**  Her weekly commitment to meditation and yoga is 150 minutes + 5 hours = 150 minutes + 300 minutes = 450 minutes.
* **Total Time Over Four Weeks:**  Over four weeks, her total time commitment is 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes.


**Therefore, Charisma has spent 1800 minutes on meditation and yoga in four weeks.**

"The quilt's total square footage is calculated by adding the area of each shirt type: 

* Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
* Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Adding these together: 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet. 

Therefore, the quilt will be 101 square feet.

"To determine the total number of sunflower seeds, we need to consider the number of seeds in each type of sunflower and then add them together. 

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds. 

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, meaning it has 36 seeds + (36 * 0.50) = 54 seeds.

Therefore, the total number of seeds is 36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds. 


**Answer:** 90

"Let's break down the problem. We are given that George owns 18 pens.  We are also told that Timothy has three times the number of pens George owns.  Therefore, Timothy has 3 * 18 = 54 pens.  Finally, we are told that Sarah has half the number of pens that Timothy has.  Therefore, Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens. 


**Answer:** Sarah has 27 pens.

"To determine Jackie's height before summer, we need to consider the information provided.  

We know that Anne is twice the height of Albert, who is 36 inches tall.  Therefore, Anne is 2 * 36 = 72 inches tall.  Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, meaning she is 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall.  

To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to subtract the 3 inches she grew during the summer.  Therefore, Jackie was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall before summer.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the answer.

First, we need to determine how much money Ryan has available for the movie tickets. He has $21.75 after paying for the ice cream.

Next, we need to figure out how many movie tickets he can purchase with that amount.  Tickets cost $6.50 each.

Therefore, Ryan can purchase 21.75 / 6.50 = 3.33 tickets. 

Since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can purchase **3** movie tickets.

"To determine the total cost of the presents, we must first calculate the individual expenses of each shopper. Ellen's purchases total $105, consisting of a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. Lani's purchases are more complex, involving a pair of sunglasses at $30 and two bathrobes at $100 each.  

Therefore, Lani's total spending is $30 + (2 * $100) = $30 + $200 = $230.

Finally, we add the individual expenses to find the total cost: $105 + $230 = $335. 


**Answer:** $335

"To determine Janet's remaining funds, we must first calculate the total amount spent.  She spent $3.50 on ice cream, $7.50 on movie tickets for herself and her sister, and $8.50 on a bracelet, totaling $3.50 + $7.50 + $8.50 = $19.50.  Subtracting this from her parents' gift of $40.00, we find that Janet has $40.00 - $19.50 = $20.50 remaining. 


**Answer:** $20.50

"Let's break down the problem. Josh services 15 cars per week, as he operates five days a week and services 3 cars per day.  To determine his earnings over two weeks, we simply multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks.  

Therefore, Josh's earnings over two weeks would be 15 cars/week * 2 weeks = 30 cars.  

Finally, we multiply the number of cars serviced by his rate of $4 per car to find his total earnings.  This gives us 30 cars * $4/car = $120. 


**Answer:** $120

"Let's break down the problem.  Randy begins with 18 cookies. He consumes 9 cookies in total, leaving him with 18 - 9 = 9 cookies.  He then eats 2 more oatmeal cookies, leaving him with 9 - 2 = 7 cookies.  He then gives 2 cookies to his friends, leaving him with 7 - 2 = 5 cookies.  Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor, resulting in 5 + 4 + 4 = 13 cookies. 

Therefore, Randy has 13 cookies. 


**Answer:** 13

"The question presents a simple economic scenario.  To determine Matthew's earnings, we need to consider the value of each half of his collection. 

* **Half the collection:**  Matthew has 12 toys, and he's willing to sell half for $5 per toy, and the other half for $7 per toy. 
* **Earnings from the first half:**  He'll receive $5 per toy * 6 toys = $30.
* **Earnings from the second half:** He'll receive $7 per toy * 6 toys = $42.
* **Total Earnings:**  $30 + $42 = $72.


**Therefore, Matthew would earn $72.**

"The question presents a scenario involving a dog's digging habits and the subsequent task of filling those holes.  To determine the number of weeks required to fill the holes, we must consider the rate at which the dog digs and the rate at which Nate fills the holes. 

The dog digs 6 holes per day, and Nate fills 9 holes per day.  The dog's digging rate is independent of Nate's filling rate.  

To determine the number of weeks to fill the holes, we must consider the total number of holes dug by the dog and the number of holes filled by Nate. 

**Answer:** 1.5 weeks

"The question asks for the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School.  

To find this difference, we need to calculate the enrollment at Butler High School and then subtract it from the enrollment at Norman High School. 

* **Butler High School's enrollment:**  (3/4) * 4000 students = 3000 students

* **Difference:** 4000 students - 3000 students = 1000 students

**Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.**

"Let's break down this problem logically.  We're given a scenario involving the gathering of laboratory supplies.  The key is to identify the key pieces of information and then apply the relevant legal principles to solve for the missing quantity.

We are told that Igor, a lab assistant, was tasked with gathering a specific number of items.  The problem states that he gathered 8 test tubes, 16 Petri dishes, and a certain number of beakers.  The total number of items he placed on the lab bench is 29.  

The question asks us to determine the number of beakers Igor lost.  

**To answer this, we need to consider the following:**

* **The quantity of items:** The total number of items on the bench is 29.
* **The quantity of test tubes and Petri dishes:** Igor gathered 8 test tubes and 16 Petri dishes.
* **The total number of items:** The total number of items on the bench is 29.

**Therefore, we can deduce that Igor lost 5 beakers.**

"The problem presents a straightforward application of basic arithmetic.  We must first determine the total number of screws required for all the tables.  Each table requires 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws, so the total number of screws needed is 4 tables * 4 legs/table * 2 screws/leg = 32 screws.  Subtracting the number of screws James has from the total number of screws needed, we find that he will have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.

"To determine the total amount raised by the girls, we need to break down the individual contributions. 

* **Alexandra:**  We know she raises $430.
* **Kim:** Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so she raises $430 + $320 = $750.
* **Maryam:** Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. Therefore, Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700.
* **Total:**  To find the total amount raised, we add the individual amounts: $750 + $700 + $300 = $1750.

"Let's break down the problem to determine Tom's weekly earnings. 

* **Reservations:** Tom receives 6 reservations per night.
* **Cost per night:**  Each reservation generates a revenue of $5 per meal, and a $5 wine cost.
* **Total cost per night:**  The cost of meals and wine per night is $10 + $5 = $15.
* **Total cost for two days:**  The total cost for two nights is $15/night * 2 nights = $30.
* **Total weekly earnings:** Tom's weekly earnings are $30.

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to determine the age of John's youngest son in three years. 

* **Key Information:**
    * We know the age of James, who is twice the age of Dora.
    * Dora will be 12 in three years.
    * John's age is relevant to the age of his youngest son.

* **Applying the Information:**
    * Dora's current age is 9 years old.
    * James is twice Dora's age, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
    * John's age is 51 years old.

* **Determining the Youngest Son's Age:**
    * The youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.
    * In three years, the youngest son will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.


**Answer:** 35

"The question presents a scenario that is fundamentally flawed.  It is impossible to determine the number of oranges peeled by each individual after an hour, as the question does not provide any information about the total number of oranges in the basket. 

**Therefore, the question cannot be answered as presented.**

"Let's analyze the situation. Mark purchased a new radiator at a discounted price from a junk shop.  The discount is a significant factor in determining the final cost.  

First, we need to calculate the discount amount: 80% of $400 is $320.  This means Mark effectively paid $320 for the radiator.

Next, we need to consider the cost of labor. Mark hired a mechanic to install the radiator, and the labor cost is $150.

Finally, we need to add the cost of the radiator and the labor cost to find the total cost.  

Therefore, the total cost for Mark is $320 + $150 = $470.
