"The book was discounted by 25%, so we need to figure out what the original price was.  Let's think about it like this:

* The sale price is $19.50.
* We know the discount was 25% of the original price. 
*  To find the original price, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 0.25, equals the difference between the sale price and the original price.

Let's do some math:

*  $19.50 - $14.62 = $4.88
*  $4.88 is 25% of the original price.
*  To find the original price, we can divide the discount by the percentage: $4.88 / 0.25 = $19.50

**Therefore, the original price of the book was $19.50.**

*  Therefore, she used 7 * 17.14 = 120 teaspoons of sugar.

"The answer is 400.  

**Here's how we can figure it out:**

* **Let's use variables:**
   *  Let 'q' represent the number of queens.
   *  Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
   *  Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know w = 2b (twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
   * We know b = 2q (twice as many babies as queens)

* **Solve for the number of bees:**
   * Since we know there are 700 bees in total, we can write the equation: q + b + w = 700
   * Substitute the values we know: q + (2q) + 2(2q) = 700
   * Simplify: q + 2q + 4q = 700
   * Combine like terms: 7q = 700
   * Solve for q: q = 100

"This is a tricky one!  Let's break it down.  We know Jerry has a flock of chickens, and he collects 42 eggs each day.  

Here's what we know:

* **Red chickens:**  Produce 3 eggs a day.
* **White chickens:** Produce 5 eggs a day.
* **Total eggs:** Jerry collects 42 eggs each day.

Let's use some logic to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has. 

**The key is to think about the relationship between the number of red and white chickens and the total number of eggs.** 

We can set up an equation to represent this:

* **3r + 5w = 42** 

We also know that:

* **r = w + 2** 

**Now, let's solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens).**

1. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:**
   3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

2. **Simplify and solve for 'w':**
   3w + 6 + 5w = 42
   8w + 6 = 42
   8w = 36
   w = 4.5

**We can't have half a chicken!**  This means there's an error in the problem. 


**Final Answer:**  There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

"This is a tricky one!  Let's break it down.

* **Let's use variables:**
   *  Let 'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool.
   *  The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

* **Calculate the water loss:**
   * Both pools lose 4 gallons/minute for 4 minutes, so they lose a total of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

* **Update the water levels:**
   * The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
   * The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

* **Set up an equation:**
   * The big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

* **Solve for x:**
   * 8x = 4(x - 16)
   * 8x = 4x - 64
   * 4x = -64
   * x = -16

* **The answer is not possible:**  We get a negative value for x, which means there's an error in the problem setup. It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way.


**Final answer:** There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

"Ah, a delightful problem!  Let's break it down.  We're looking for the savings on our ice cream and milk.  

First, the ice cream.  It's a simple matter of subtraction.  The price has been reduced by $2, so we know that's a good thing.  

Now, the milk.  We need to know the original price to calculate the discount.  

Once we have that, we can calculate the total cost of the ice cream and the milk.  Then, we can subtract the original price of the milk from the total cost to find the savings. 

**Please provide the original price of the milk so we can complete the calculation.**

"The ratio of electric poles to wires is 1:3.  If the total number of wires is 45, we can find the number of poles needed by figuring out how many units of wires are represented by the ratio.  Since the ratio is 1:3, we can divide the total number of wires by the ratio to find the value of one unit.  This gives us 45 wires / 4 = 11.25.  Since the ratio is 1:3, we multiply the value of one unit by 3 to find the number of poles.  This gives us 11.25 * 3 = 33.75.

"Hmm, this is a tricky one.  Let's break it down.  We know that 5 people traded records, and they ended up with 7 new ones.  This means they traded a certain number of old records for new ones.  

To figure out how many old records they brought in, we need to figure out how many new records they got.  

**Here's how we can do that:**

* **Each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record.** 
* **We know they got 7 new records in total.** 
* **Let's think about how many times they traded to get 7 new records.** 

**Here's a possible solution:**

* **If they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, they traded 7 / 2 = 3.5 times.** 
* **Since we can't have half a record, this means there's an error in the problem setup.**

First, we need to figure out how much Billy spent on candy.  We know he had $10.00 and the candy costs $1.50 per pound.  So, we can calculate how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing his money by the price per pound. 

* $10.00 / $1.50 per pound = 6.67 pounds.

Now, we need to figure out how much money he has left after buying candy.  We know he spent $0.20 on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each.  

* $0.20 / $0.05 per gumball = 40 gumballs.

So, Billy bought 6.67 pounds of candy.

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip, and it does this three times a day.  To figure out how many days it takes for the train to need service, we need to know how many miles it travels in total.  The train travels 675 miles in a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so we can divide the total miles traveled by the service interval.  The number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.  Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"Ah, a classic land puzzle!  Let's break it down.  We know he has 12.8 hectares left after selling some.  That means he had more than that to begin with.  We can figure out how much he had originally by using a simple equation.  

* **Let 'x' represent the original amount of land.**

* **He sold 3/5 of his land, which is (3/5)x hectares.**

* **He has 12.8 hectares left, so (1 - 3/5)x = 12.8**

* **Simplify the equation: (2/5)x = 12.8**

* **Solve for x:** 
   * Multiply both sides by (5/2): x = 12.8 * (5/2)
   * Calculate: x = 32 hectares

**Answer:**  Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"Mel's energy consumption is a fascinating study in the subtle shades of electricity.  He uses 900 watts of power for 8 hours a day, a stark black void of energy.  But, he's a master of efficiency, reducing his AC usage by 5 hours.  This means he'll save a significant amount of energy, a sleek black void of wasted power.  

To calculate this, we must first understand the energy he uses in a day.  He uses 900 watts per hour for 8 hours, a total of 7200 watt-hours.  Now, with a reduction in usage, he uses 2700 watt-hours per day.  This means he's saving a substantial amount of energy, a black void of wasted power.  

Over 30 days, he'll save a whopping 135 kWh, a truly black and powerful statement of energy conservation. 

**Answer: 135 kWh**

"The total cost of the blouses is $56. 

**Answer:** $56 
"
"The answer is 405. 
"
"The answer is 56. 

**Here's why:**

We can solve this problem using a system of equations.  Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  We know that the total number of heads is 180, so:

c + d = 180

We also know that each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one, so the total number of bumps is 304. This translates to:

2c + d = 304

Now we can solve for 'd' in the first equation:

c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:

2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

360 - 2d + d = 304
360 - d = 304
-d = -56
d = 56

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.

"The difference in cost is $3. 

**Answer:** $3 
"
"The answer is 15. 

**Here's why:**

We can solve this problem using a system of equations.  Let's represent the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'.  We know that the total number of legs is 70, and the total number of heads is 20. 

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2g = 70 (Sheep have 4 legs, geese have 2)
* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20

We can solve for 's' using substitution.  Let's solve Equation 2 for 'g': g = 20 - s.  

Now, substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70.  Simplify and solve for 's': 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15.

You're looking for the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes.  We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.  To find out how many hash browns you can make with 96 potatoes, we can set up a proportion. 

* **Proportion:** 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns
* **Solve for x:** Cross-multiply and solve for x. 
   * 6 * x = 36 * 96
   * 6x = 3456
   * x = 3456 / 6
   * x = 576

Let's break it down. We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet.  We also know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. 

Let's represent the ages of the twins and triplets with variables.  

* Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
* Let '3t' represent the age of the triplet.

We can set up an equation to represent the combined ages: t + 3t = 44. 

Solving for 't', we get: 4t = 44, so t = 11.

*  Two-thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians, so there are 18 * (2/3) = 12 puppies.

"Ah, a game of skill and competition!  Let's break down this digital duel.  

Ava and Emma, both vying for victory, are playing a game of skill and strategy.  They each attempt a level, and the victor is the one with the highest score.  

Here's how the scoring works:

* **Enemies:**  Each successful jump on an enemy earns 10 points.
* **Berries:**  Collecting berries yields 5 points.
* **Time:**  The timer determines the final score.  Each second remaining at the end of the level earns 30 points.

Ava, a master of strategy, has a slight edge.  She jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, and collects 3 more berries.  However, she finishes the level 4 seconds slower.  

To determine the difference in their scores, we need to calculate the points for each player. 

**The answer is:**

* **Ava's score:**  
* **Emma's score:**

"The answer is 10.  

**Here's why:**

* Bob started with 7 fish.
* He got 17 more fish, bringing his total to 24.
* After adding the new fish, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. 
* This means the number of white fish is half the number of orange fish. 
* To find the number of white fish, we need to figure out how many orange fish he has. 
* We know he has 20 orange fish. 
* Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, he must have bought 10 white fish.

**Here's why:**

Let's break it down:

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  We'll use 'x' to represent the number of cards PJ has.
    *  Smendrick has 3 times PJ's amount, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
    *  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

* **Set up an equation:** The total number of cards is 341, so:
    * x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

* **Solve for x:**
    * 7x + 12 = 341
    * 7x = 329

We know the team scored a total of 45 points.  Bahati scored the most, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.  

To figure out Azibo's score, we need to find the value of Dinar's score.  

Let's use a little algebra to solve for Dinar's score.  

*  We know that Bahati's score is equal to Dinar's score plus 10, and that Bahati's score is 20 more than Azibo's score.  

*  Let's represent Azibo's score as ""A"".  

*  We can then write the following equation:  
    * B = A + 20 
    * B = D + 10

*  We can also write the following equation:
    * A = D - 10

*  Now, let's substitute the value of A into the first equation:
    * B = (D - 10) + 20
    * B = D + 10

*  We know that B = D + 10, and that B = A + 20.  

*  We can now substitute the value of B into the equation:
    * D + 10 = A + 20

*  We can now solve for D:
    * D = A + 10

*  We can now substitute the value of A into the equation:
    * D = (D - 10) + 10

*  We can now solve for D:
    * D = D

*  We can now solve for D:
    * D = 11.67 (approximately)

*  Now that we know D, we can find Azibo's score:
    * A = D - 10
    * A = 11.67 - 10
    * A = 1.67 (approximately)


**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

"Alright, let's break this down.  We're dealing with Pokemon, the ultimate digital creatures, and we need to figure out how many Stan caught. 

* **Let's use variables:**
    *  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    *  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    *  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
    * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
    * A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    *  We can use the first two equations to help us.  
    *  Substitute the first equation into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    *  Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    *  Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    *  Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    *  Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    *  Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Ah, a delicious problem!  Let's break it down.  We need to figure out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets.  

First, we need to figure out the size of a kid's slice.  Let's say a kid gets a slice of size 'x'.  

Now, the adults get twice the size of a kid's slice, so each adult gets 2x.

The total slices are 2 adults + 4 kids = 6 slices.

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the size of an adult's slice by the total slices and multiply by 100%. 

So, the percentage is (2x / 6) * 100% 

**The answer is (2x/6) * 100%**

"The tank is almost full, but not quite.  Let's break it down:

* **Day 1:** Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of that, which is 3375 gallons. Together they pump 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.
* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she did on Day 1, which is 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she did on Day 1, which is 1125 gallons. Together they pump 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.
* **Total:**  In two days, they pump a total of 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.
* **Remaining:**  The tank still has 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Ah, a classic financial puzzle.  Let's break it down.  

First, we need to figure out how much Janet earns each week.  She makes $10 per hour from her wage and an additional $15 from tips, so her total weekly earnings are $25.  

Now, she wants to save 20% of the car's price, which is $10,000.  That means she needs to save $2,000.  

Finally, she saves $5 each week.  To figure out how many weeks it will take, we divide the total savings needed by her weekly savings: $2,000 / $5 = 400 weeks.

"The car's value depreciates each year, so we need to calculate the price in 2010.  

Here's how to figure it out:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car depreciates by 21% of $20000, which is $20000 * 0.21 = $4200.  The price is now $20000 - $4200 = $15800.
* **Year 2 (2009):** The car depreciates by 21% of $15800, which is $15800 * 0.21 = $3318.  The price is now $15800 - $3318 = $12482.
* **Year 3 (2010):** The car depreciates by 21% of $12482, which is $12482 * 0.21 = $2607.  The price is now $12482 - $2607 = **$9875**.

"The meal took 98 minutes, and Donovan's part was x minutes long. Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, so it was x + 18 minutes.  We know that the total time was 98 minutes, so we can set up an equation: x + (x + 18) = 98.  Solving for x, we get 2x + 18 = 98, so 2x = 80, and x = 40.  Betsy's part was 40 + 18 = 58 minutes long.

"Okay, let's break this down.  We're looking for the difference in eggs painted by Camden and Arnold. 

*  We know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. 
*  Let's figure out how many eggs Sarah painted.  We know that the total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah is 30.  Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can represent Sarah's eggs as 'y'.  So, we have the equation: y + (y + 12) = 30.
*  Simplifying the equation, we get 2y + 12 = 30.
*  Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2y = 18.
*  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that y = 9.  So, Sarah painted 9 eggs.
*  Now, let's find out how many eggs Camden painted.  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so he painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.
*  Finally, we can find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs.  Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 11 eggs.  The difference is 21 - 11 = 10.


**Answer:** Camden painted 10 more eggs than Arnold.

"Jack has $120. 

**Answer:** $120 
"
"The answer is 20. 

**Here's why:**

*  Let's break down the problem. We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, and the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. 
*  We can use this information to find the lengths of each rope. 
*  The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters. 
*  Solving for the length of the yellow rope, we find it to be 12 centimeters. 
*  The length of the red rope is then 4 times the length of the blue rope, which is 4 * (12 - 7) = 20 centimeters.

"The dehumidifier's efficiency is a fascinating study in the depths of moisture removal.  Let's break it down:

* **Low setting:** 1 liter/day
* **Medium setting:** 2 liters/day (twice the low setting)
* **High setting:** 4 liters/day (twice the medium setting)

Now, let's calculate the total water removed:

* **Low setting:** 3 days * 1 liter/day = 3 liters
* **Medium setting:** 3 days * 2 liters/day = 6 liters
* **High setting:** 5 days * 4 liters/day = 20 liters

Adding these together, we get a total of 3 + 6 + 20 = **30 liters**

"The question is a simple one, really.  We need to figure out how far off Tim's guess was. 

First, we need to know the volume of the jar.  It's a square, so we can calculate that easily.  6 inches by 6 inches, and 15 inches tall.  That's 540 cubic inches.

Next, we need to figure out how many jelly beans are in the jar.  We know the volume of the jar is 540 cubic inches, and each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.  So, we can calculate the number of jelly beans.

Finally, we need to figure out how far off his guess was.  We know the true number of red jelly beans is 900, and he estimated 2880.  The difference is 900 - 2880 = -1980.  

**Answer:** Tim was 36 jelly beans off.
