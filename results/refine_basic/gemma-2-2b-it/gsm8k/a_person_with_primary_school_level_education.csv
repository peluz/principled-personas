"Jill works a lot! She teaches for 35 hours a week and coaches for 15 hours a week.  That's a lot of work!  

To figure out how much she makes, we need to know how much she makes per hour for each job. 

* **Teacher:** She makes $20 per hour teaching.
* **Coach:** She makes $30 per hour coaching.

So, let's see how much she makes each week:

* **Teacher:** 35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week
* **Coach:** 15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Now, let's add those together to see how much she makes in total each week: $700 + $450 = $1150/week

And since she works 52 weeks a year, that means she makes $1150/week * 52 weeks = $60,600 a year!

"Okay, so Kyle got the book for $19.50, and that's with a discount.  The discount was 25%.  To find the original price, we need to figure out what the price was before the discount. 

Think about it like this: if we take away 25% of the original price, we get the price Kyle paid.  

Let's say the original price was $x.  We know that 25% of $x is $0.25x.  So, we can write an equation:

$19.50 = $x - 0.25x

Now, let's solve for x:

$19.50 = 0.75x

To find x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

$19.50 / 0.75 = x

$26.00 = x

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like a special mix, 7 parts Darrell to 11 parts Allen.  If their ages add up to 162, how old will Allen be in 10 years?

**Here's how we can figure it out:**

* Let's think of Darrell's age as 7 things, and Allen's age as 11 things.
* We know their ages together are 162. 
* So, 7 times Darrell's age plus 11 times Allen's age equals 162.

**Let's solve for Allen's age:**

* We know Darrell's age is 7 times something, and Allen's age is 11 times something. 
* We can write that as 7x + 11x = 162.
* That means 18x = 162.
* To find out what x is, we divide both sides by 18.
* So, x = 162 / 18.
* That means x is 9.
* Allen's age is 11 times x, so Allen is 11 * 9 = 99.
* In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


**Answer:** Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years.

"Let's figure out the average number of jelly beans!

*  Another friend says there are 20 more than half of that, which is 40.
*  The third friend says there are 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more.
*  The third friend then has 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, let's add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Finally, we divide the total by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80

So, the average guess is 80.

"Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.  Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 1 * 2 = 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 2 * 4 = 8 years old. 

**Answer:** 8

"Okay, so the dragon is super far away, 1000 feet. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet, but if she has a special gem, she can throw it even farther!  She can throw it 3 times farther than normal.  So, how far can she throw it?  

Let's think about it:

* The gem makes the javelin go 3 times farther.
* That means the javelin can go 400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet.
* Now, we need to find out how far Polly can be from the dragon and still throw the javelin. 

The javelin can go 1600 feet! 


**Answer:** 1600 feet

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* Grandma made 5 pies, and each pie has 8 slices.
* That means she made 5 * 8 = 40 slices of pie.
* After everyone ate some, there were 14 slices left.
* So, 40 - 14 = 26 slices were eaten.

**Answer:** 26

"Okay, so the chips have 250 calories in each serving.  You have 5 servings in the bag.  You want to know how many grams you can eat.  You've already eaten 1800 calories.  You have 200 calories left.  So, you can eat 200 calories of chips. 

**Answer:** 200 grams

"Okay, so Meredith writes blog posts.  She writes 5 on Monday, and on Tuesday she writes twice as many as Monday, which is 2 times 5 = 10. Then on Wednesday she writes twice as many as Tuesday, which is 2 times 10 = 20.  So she writes 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 blog posts.  That means she writes for 35 posts * 4 hours/post = 140 hours. 

**Answer:** 140

"Sophia can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas! 

Here's how we know:

* She drove 100 miles.
* She used 4 gallons of gas.
* Her car can hold 12 gallons of gas.

To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we need to figure out how many miles she can drive with one gallon of gas. 

* She used 4 gallons of gas to drive 100 miles.
* So, one gallon of gas can take her 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles.
* Since her tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive 12 gallons * 25 miles/gallon = 300 miles.

"Kelian has to read 60 instructions. 

Here's why:

* The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which has 20.
* Twice 20 is 40.
* So, the second recipe has 40 instructions.
* In total, Kelian needs to read 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.

"Okay, so Shiela bought five phones, and each one costs $150.  She's paying for them over three months.  She has to pay a little extra for borrowing the money, like a small fee.  That fee is 2% of the total cost of the phones.  So, how much does she pay each month? 

**Answer:** $765 
"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Artie will make!

* Marigolds: He sells 12 pots for $2.74 each, so that's 12 * $2.74 = $32.88
* Petunias: He sells 9 pots for $1.87 each, so that's 9 * $1.87 = $16.83
* Begonias: He sells 17 pots for $2.12 each, so that's 17 * $2.12 = $36.14

Now, let's add all those amounts together: $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.14 = $85.85

So, Artie will make $85.85!

"Okay, so Luke built his sandcastle in four levels. The top level was 16 square feet.  

To find the average, we need to find the total area of all the levels and then divide by the number of levels. 

* Level 1: 16 square feet
* Level 2: 8 square feet
* Level 3: 4 square feet
* Level 4: 2 square feet

The total area is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet.

The average is 30 / 4 = 7.5 square feet. 

So the answer is 7.5.

"Cecilia needs to feed her puppy a lot of food!  She needs 1 cup a day for the first 180 days. Then, she needs to feed it 2 cups a day for the rest of its life.  

To figure out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to know how many days the puppy lives.  Let's say the puppy lives for a whole year. 

If the puppy lives for a year, it will need 2 cups a day for 365 days. 

To find out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to add up the food she needs for the first 180 days and the food she needs for the rest of its life. 

She needs 180 cups for the first 180 days and 730 cups for the rest of its life. 

To find out how many bags of food she'll need, we need to divide the total cups of food by the number of cups in each bag. 

She needs 910 cups of food. 

She'll need 9 bags of food.

"Okay, so Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  David does half as much as Sarah, so he does 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds.  Raymond does half as much as Sarah, so he does 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds.  The difference is 200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds. 

**Answer:** 100

"Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.  He wants to buy 18 flowers.  Which is cheaper?

**A.**  Packages of 3
**B.** Packages of 2

To figure out which is cheaper, let's look at how much each package costs.

* **Packages of 3:** $2.50 for 3 flowers
* **Packages of 2:** $1.00 for 2 flowers

So, if he buys 18 flowers, he can buy them in packages of 2 for $1.00 each, or in packages of 3 for $2.50 each.

**Answer:** Packages of 2

"If Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, we can figure out how many Harald sold by thinking about how many copies they sold together. 

Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies.  Marilyn sold 10 times that amount, so she sold 10x copies. 

Together they sold 88,000 copies.  So, we can write an equation:

x + 10x = 88,000

Now, let's solve for x:

11x = 88,000
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. 


**Answer:** 8,000

"Okay, so Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.  Gerald got a little bit faster after changing his diet.  Lee ran the race in 38 seconds.  How fast can Gerald run now?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* Let's say Gerald's original time was 'x' seconds.
* Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, so Lee ran in 'x + 2' seconds.
* Gerald's time is now 'x + 0.1x' because he got faster.
* We know Lee ran in 38 seconds, so we can write an equation: x + 2 = 38
* Let's solve for 'x':  Subtract 2 from both sides, and we get x = 36.
* Now we can find Gerald's new time: x + 0.1x = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** Gerald can run the race in 39.6 seconds.

**Answer:** 348

"Okay, so we know there are 200 students in total.  Half of them are boys, so there are 200 / 2 = 100 boys. 

We also know that 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts.  Let's figure out how many girls there are.  We know there are 200 students total, and 100 boys, so there are 200 - 100 = 100 girls.

Now, we need to find out how many girls are NOT in the Girl Scouts.  We know 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, so 100 girls / 3 = 33.33.  Since we can't have a fraction of a girl, we know that 33.33 is not possible.  So, we need to find the number of girls that are NOT in the Girl Scouts.  We know that 100 girls - 33.33 = 66.67.

"Okay, so Marcell and Beatrice are having a roll-up eating contest!  They both eat their whole roll-ups.  To figure out how many they ate in total, we need to know how big each roll-up is. 

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 wide and 24 long.  Marcell's are 3 wide and 14 long.  

To find out how much they ate, we need to add up the area of each roll-up.  

Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 * 24 = 48 square rolls.  Marcell's are 3 * 14 = 42 square rolls.

So, together they ate 48 + 42 = 90 square rolls.

To find out how many they ate on average, we divide the total area by the number of people. 

90 square rolls / 2 people = 45 square rolls per person. 

So the answer is 45.

"Okay, so Katy makes coffee with sugar and water.  The ratio is 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  

To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to figure out how many parts of the ratio are in 120 teaspoons. 

Let's think about it like this: if we have 7 parts of the ratio, and we know she used 120 teaspoons, we can figure out how many parts are in 120 teaspoons. 

We can do that by dividing 120 teaspoons by 7. 

120 / 7 = 17.14 

So, Katy used about 17.14 parts of the ratio.

"Okay, so we know Adrien made more money than Lylah.  Let's say Lylah made $x.  Adrien made 30% more than Lylah, so he made 1.30 times what Lylah made. 

Four years later, Adrien made 40% more than he did four years ago.  That means he made 1.40 times what he made four years ago.

We know Adrien made $40000 four years ago.  Let's figure out how much he makes now.

* Adrien's salary now is $40000 * 1.40 = $56000

Now, we need to figure out how much Lylah made four years ago.  Since Adrien made 30% more than Lylah, we can say that Lylah made $40000 / 1.30 = $3077.

Now, we can figure out how much Lylah makes now.  She made $3077 four years ago, so she makes $3077 * 1.40 = $4300 now.

Finally, we can add up their salaries to find their total salary four years later.  Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary = $56000 + $4300 = $60300.

"Okay, let's figure out how much Rory's order will cost!

* **Subs:** 2 subs cost $7.50 each, so that's 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
* **Chips:** 2 bags of chips cost $1.50 each, so that's 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
* **Cookies:** 2 cookies cost $1.00 each, so that's 2 * $1.00 = $2.00
* **Delivery:**  They charge a 20% fee on the whole order, so that's $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 * 0.20 = $10.50
* **Tip:** Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.

Now, let's add all the costs together: $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 + $10.50 + $5.00 = $35.50

So, Rory's order will cost $35.50.

"There are 20 cars in total.  12 are automatic, and 4 are manual. That means 4 are semi-automatic.  

To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100. 

So, 4 / 20 = 0.2.  Then, we multiply that by 100: 0.2 * 100 = 20%. 

So the answer is 20%.

"Okay, let's think about this!

* We know there are 700 bees in the hive.
* We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
* We also know there are twice as many babies as queens.

Let's use some simple math to figure it out!

**Let's use letters to help us:**

*  Let 'q' be the number of queens.
*  Let 'b' be the number of baby bees.
*  Let 'w' be the number of worker bees.

**Now, let's write down what we know:**

*  We know 'w' is twice the number of 'b' bees. So, w = 2b
*  We also know 'b' is twice the number of 'q' bees. So, b = 2q

**Let's put it all together:**

*  We know that 'q' + 'b' + 'w' = 700 
*  We can substitute the values we know: q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700
*  Let's simplify: q + 2q + 4q = 700
*  Combine the 'q's: 7q = 700
*  Now, we can find 'q' by dividing both sides by 7: q = 100

**Now that we know how many queens there are, we can find the number of worker bees:**

*  We know 'w' is twice the number of 'b' bees. So, w = 2b
*  We also know 'b' is twice the number of 'q' bees. So, b = 2 * 100 = 200
*  Now we can find 'w': w = 2 * 200 = 400

**Answer:** There are 400 worker bees.

**D.** 720 feet 


 
Let's add up the length of all the rolls, croissants, and baguettes. 

* Rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* Croissants: 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* Baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add all the lengths together: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches. 

Finally, we need to convert that to feet. 3360 inches is equal to 3360 / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

"Okay, so the price of the marbles goes up every two months.  

Here's how we can figure out how much it will cost after 36 months:

* **Month 1:** $20
* **Month 2:** $20 + $8 = $28
* **Month 3:** $28 + $8 = $36
* **Month 4:** $36 + $8 = $44
* **Month 5:** $44 + $8 = $52
* **Month 6:** $52 + $8 = $60
* **Month 7:** $60 + $8 = $68
* **Month 8:** $68 + $8 = $76
* **Month 9:** $76 + $8 = $84
* **Month 10:** $84 + $8 = $92
* **Month 11:** $92 + $8 = $100
* **Month 12:** $100 + $8 = $108
* **Month 13:** $108 + $8 = $116
* **Month 14:** $116 + $8 = $124
* **Month 15:** $124 + $8 = $132
* **Month 16:** $132 + $8 = $140
* **Month 17:** $140 + $8 = $148
* **Month 18:** $148 + $8 = $156
* **Month 19:** $156 + $8 = $164


So, after 36 months, the bag of marbles will cost $164.

"Okay, let's figure out how much all the toys are worth!

* We know a red car costs $4.
* We also know a set of three action figures costs $15.
* The doll costs the same as three action figures, so it costs $15 too.

To find the total cost, we add up the cost of each toy: $4 (red car) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $34

"Jackie has to decide if she should do her taxes herself or hire someone to do it for her. If she does it herself, she'll have to give up 3 hours of work, and she'll lose $35 for each hour she doesn't work. The person who helps her with her taxes costs $90.  

If she hires someone, she'll have to pay $90. If she does her taxes herself, she'll lose $105 because she won't work for 3 hours. 

So, if she hires someone, she'll save $90.

"Let's think about this problem!

* Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means Brooke is half Seth's age.
* In two years, their ages will add up to 28.

Let's use some numbers to help us:

* Let's say Brooke is 'B' years old.
* Seth is 'S' years old.

We know:

* S = 2B  (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
* S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in two years)

Now we can use these clues to find out how old Seth is. 

Let's use the first clue to help us:

* S = 2B 

We can substitute this into the second clue:

* 2B + B + 2 = 28

Let's solve for B:

* 3B + 2 = 28
* 3B = 26
* B = 8.67 (approximately)

Now we know Brooke is about 8.67 years old.  We can use this to find Seth's age:

* S = 2B
* S = 2 * 8.67
* S = 17.34 (approximately)

**So, Seth is about 17.34 years old.**

* Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

"Okay, so Jessica has student loans, a credit card, and a mortgage.  She wants to pay a little extra on top of what she has to pay each month. 

* **Student loans:** $300
* **Credit card:** $200
* **Mortgage:** $500

That's a total of $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000 each month.  

Jessica wants to pay 50% more, so she'll pay $1000 + ($1000 * 0.50) = $1500 each month.

That means she'll pay $1500 every month.

"It will take Billy a long time to peel and cut all the potatoes! 

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Peeling:** Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. He has 60 potatoes, so he'll need 1.5 minutes * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes to peel them all.
* **Cutting:** Billy takes 5 seconds to cut each potato. He has 60 potatoes, so he'll need 5 seconds * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds to cut them all.
* **Total Time:**  To find the total time, we need to add the time for peeling and cutting. 90 minutes + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds. 

**Answer:** 5700 seconds

They spent $5.00 on lemons and sugar for each gallon, so they spent $5.00 * 2.5 gallons = $12.50 on lemons.

"There are 160 Chinese people on the team.  Half of them are boys, so there are 60 boys.  To find out how many girls are on the team, we need to subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people.  So, there are 160 - 60 = 100 girls. 

**Answer:** 100

"Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.  Together, they have 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.

**Answer:** $130 
"
"The winner got 3/4 of the votes, so they got 3 out of 4 parts of the votes.  If there were 80 votes in total, the winner got 60 votes.  To find out how many votes the loser got, we need to subtract the winner's votes from the total votes.  So, the loser got 80 - 60 = 20 votes. 

**Answer:** 20

"Okay, so Sandra wants red roses, and she ordered four times as many as white carnations.  She also got 200 pink calla lilies.  To figure out how many red roses she needs, we need to know how many white carnations she ordered.  

We know she got 200 pink calla lilies, and those are five times the number of white carnations. So, she ordered 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.

Now, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so she ordered 4 * 40 = 160 red roses.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds.

"Okay, so Jerry's die has numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  

* He can get a number bigger than 3 on the die, like 4, 5, or 6.  There are 3 of those.
* He can also get two even numbers in a row, like 2, 2, or 4, 4. There are 3 even numbers.

So, he has a 1/2 chance of getting a number bigger than 3 and a 1/4 chance of getting two even numbers in a row.

The difference is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4. 

That means he's 25% more likely to get a number bigger than 3.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the rats have 6 pieces of straw each, and there are 3 cages. 
* We also know there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
* Finally, there are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.
* We know 160 pieces of straw were given to the small rodents.

So, let's see how many rats there are. 

* 160 pieces - 50 pieces (hamsters) = 110 pieces for the rats.
* 110 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 18.33 rats.
* Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down. 

**So, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets, and then $4.50 less on food, so they spent $15.75 on food.  Then they went on two rides that cost $33 each, so that was $66 total.  So, the total cost was $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.00.  To figure out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by three: $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

"Okay, so we know half a dozen plates cost $36000.  That's like 6 plates, and each plate costs $6000.  

Now, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that.  So, we need to figure out how much twenty dozen cups cost.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Twenty dozen cups is like 20 groups of 12 cups.
* So, we need to find the total cost of 20 groups of 12 cups.

To do that, we can use the price of one cup.  

* We know that 20 dozen cups cost $34800. 
* We can divide that by 240 cups to find the price of one cup.

So, the answer is $145.

"Sara wants a jacket and shoes, and she needs to save up for them.  She earns money babysitting and mowing the lawn. 

* **Babysitting:** She earns $5 each time she babysits. She babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20.
* **Mowing:** Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. 

To figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, let's see how much money she needs:

* The jacket costs $30 and the shoes cost $20 each, so that's $30 + ($20 * 2) = $70.
* She needs $70 and has $10 saved.
* She needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.
* She earns $24 for each lawn mowing, so she needs $60 / $24 = 2.5 lawn mowings.

She needs to mow the lawn 3 times to have enough money.

"Let's think about this problem step by step:

* **Imagine the pools:**  We have two pools, one big and one small.
* **Leaks:** Both pools are leaking water at the same rate, which is 4 gallons per minute.
* **Time:**  The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.
* **Now:** The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

**Let's figure out how much water is in the small pool now:**

* **Think about the big pool:**  The big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. 
* **Think about the time:**  The big pool lost 4 gallons in 4 minutes. 
* **Think about the small pool:** The small pool lost 4 gallons in 4 minutes. 

**To find out how much water is in the small pool now, we need to figure out how much water it had 4 minutes ago.**

"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and wants to pay it back with some extra money.  She's going to pay $165 each month for 12 months.  

To figure out how much she'll owe after 12 months, we need to know how much extra money she's adding.  

*  She's adding 10% of the $2000, which is like adding 10 out of every 100 dollars. That's like saying she's adding $200.

Now, let's see how much she'll pay in total.  She'll pay $165 each month for 12 months, so that's $165 * 12 = $2040.

Finally, we need to add the extra money she's paying back.  So, she'll pay $2040 + $200 = $2240.

So, how much will she owe after 12 months?  She'll owe $2240.

"Okay, here's how we can figure this out:

* **Harriet's age:** Harriet is 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:** Harriet is half Zack's age, so Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.
* **Their average age in three years:**  To find the average, we add their ages and then divide by 3.  So, (63 + 21 + 42) / 3 = 126 / 3 = 42 years old.

**Answer:** 42

"Let's figure out how many points Jojo scored!

* Naomi scored 68 points.
* Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is 34. So Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
* Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
* Together, they scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 207 points.
* To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points from the total points they scored: 251 - 207 = 44 points.

**Answer:** Jojo scored 44 points.

"Okay, so Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank.  She then got some rainwater, and that was twice the water left in the tank.  So, how much water is left? 

*  **Think about it:**  She used 90 liters, and there was 120 liters to start.  So, she used up 90 liters.  
*  **Think about the rainwater:** The rainwater was twice the amount left, so she got 2 * 30 liters = 60 liters.
*  **Add it all up:**  She had 30 liters left, and then got 60 liters of rainwater.  So, there is 30 + 60 = 90 liters of water left in the tank.

"Chad's burrito cost $6.50 for the base. He added meat for $2.00, cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces for $0.25 each, making it $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $14.00. He also got an upgrade for $3.00, so his total cost was $14.00 + $3.00 = $17.00.  He had a $5.00 gift card, so he only has to pay $17.00 - $5.00 = $12.00.

**Here's why:**

* Kalinda can put 4 pieces every minute.
* Her mom can put half as many, so she puts 2 pieces every minute.
* Together, they put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces every minute.
* They have 360 pieces to put together.
* To find out how long it takes, we divide the total pieces by how many they put together each minute: 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.
* 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

"Okay, so we know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another.  The difference between the snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  

Let's think about this:

*  We need to find out how many fish are in each aquarium. 

We know the difference in snails is twice the number of fish.  Let's use that to help us!

*  The difference in snails is 32 - 4 = 28.
*  Twice the number of fish is 28.
*  So, the number of fish is 28 / 2 = 14.

So, each aquarium has 14 fish.

"Okay, so the makeup artist charges $250 an hour. She works for 6 hours each day for 4 days a week, so that's $250 * 6 * 4 = $6000 per week.  The movie takes 5 weeks, so she works for 5 weeks * $6000/week = $30000.  The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount, so she pays $30000 - $3000 = $27000. 


**Answer:** $27000

"Okay, so Isabelle spent $12 on the cake, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags. That's a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $94.  She shared the cost with her parents, so each person paid $94 / 3 = $31.33.

"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds.  So, the chef has 4 bags * 50 pounds/bag = 200 pounds of onions.  Each pound of onions costs $1.50.  So, the chef spent 200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300.

"Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  He goes up to a floor that is 4 times his starting floor plus 6.  To find out what floor he's on now, we need to solve the problem. 

Here's how:

*  Let's say the floor Bill is on is represented by the letter 'x'.
*  The problem says the floor is 4 times his starting floor plus 6.  
*  So, x = 4 * 3 + 6 
*  We can solve this equation: x = 12 + 6
*  So, x = 18

**Answer:** Bill is on the 18th floor.

"Okay, so Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than that, which is like 30 times - 9 times = 21 times. Then Robert went down the slide 4 times as many times as Anne, which is 4 * 21 = 84 times.

"Nancy has to pay $6.00 for her books. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* Each book costs $0.50. 
* She has 8 books.
* So, the books cost $0.50 * 8 = $4.00
* Plus, there's a $2.00 fee for being late.
* So, the total cost is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00

"Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box, so she has 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. Then her friend gives her 20 more marbles, so she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles. 

**Answer:** 270

"Okay, so Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half as many, which is 6 / 2 = 3 trees.  Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, so he has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.  To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract: 11 - 3 = 8.  So the answer is 8.

"Okay, here's how much money they have together:

* Carmen has $100.
* Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so she has $100 + $25 = $125.
* Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $125 + $50 = $175.
* Together, they have $100 + $125 + $175 = $300.

So the answer is 300.

"Okay, so the oil takes 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees.  That's like adding 40% of 20 minutes, which is 20 minutes * 0.40 = 8 minutes. So, it takes 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes to get to 400 degrees.  Finally, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken after it's warm, so it takes 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.  So, the whole thing takes 20 minutes + 28 minutes + 23 minutes = 71 minutes. 


**Answer:** 71

"Okay, so the sweater has a body, a collar, and a rosette.  The body takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that, which is 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.  The whole sweater has 1800 stitches.  To find out how many stitches are in each sleeve, we need to find the difference between the total stitches and the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette. That's 1800 - 900 - 90 - 180 = 630 stitches.  So, each sleeve has 630 / 2 = 315 stitches. 

**Answer:** 315

"Sean has to memorize 84 lines. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

* **The song:** He has to learn 54 lines for his song.
* **The first scene:** The first scene has twice the lines of the song, so it has 54 lines * 2 = 108 lines.
* **The first scene's lines for Sean:** He has 108 lines / 3 = 36 lines in the first scene.
* **The second scene:** The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 lines + 6 lines = 60 lines.
* **The second scene's lines for Sean:** He has 60 lines * 4/5 = 48 lines in the second scene.
* **Total lines:**  He has to memorize 36 lines + 48 lines = 84 lines.

"Okay, so Carly had 80 cards.  

*  Half of them had the letter A, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 cards.
*  After taking out the A cards, she had 80 - 40 = 40 cards left.
*  Half of those left had the letter B, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 cards.
*  Now she has 40 - 20 = 20 cards left.
*  Five-eighths of the rest had the letter C, so that's 20 * (5/8) = 12.5 cards.  Since we can't have half a card, we know that not all of the rest had C.
*  The rest of the cards must have had the letter D.

"Okay, so we know a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half as many.  So a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots. 

We have 40 cobras and 60 mambas, so that's 40 * 70 + 60 * 35 = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots in total.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"Okay, so Alani wrote 20 stories, her brother wrote 40, and her sister wrote 60.  They all wrote more stories in the second week.  Let's see...

* Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories

* Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories

That's a lot of stories!  If we add them all up, we get 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

The flag has 76 stars in total.  It has 3 rows of 8 stars, and 2 rows of 6 stars.  That's a total of 24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars.  

The rest of the stars are in 5-star rows.  We need to figure out how many of those there are.  We know there are 76 total stars - 36 stars = 40 stars left.  

We can divide the 40 stars by 5 stars per row to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are.  That's 40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows. 

So the answer is 8.

"You need enough trucks to carry all the flagstones.  

Here's how to figure that out:

* **How much do the flagstones weigh?** Each flagstone is 75 pounds.
* **How many flagstones are there?** There are 80 flagstones.
* **How much can each truck carry?** Each truck can carry 2000 pounds.

To find out how many trucks you need, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by how much each truck can carry. 

* 5,000 pounds (total weight) / 2,000 pounds (per truck) = 2.5 trucks

Since you can't have half a truck, you'll need **3 trucks** to carry all the flagstones.

"Okay, so we know the fast car is going 60 miles per hour. The slow car is going half as fast, which is 30 miles per hour.  

To find out how long it took the slow car to travel the same distance, we can use this:

* **Distance = Speed x Time**

We know the distance is 480 miles, and we know the slow car's speed is 30 miles per hour. Let's find out how long it took them to travel that distance.

* 480 miles = 30 miles per hour * Time

To find the time, we need to divide the distance by the speed:

* Time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours

So, the slow car took **16 hours** to travel the same distance.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* Ali has 22 medals.
* Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
* Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.
* We know they have 39 medals, and we want to find out how many medals were given out in total. 

To find the total number of medals given out, we need to think about how many medals were given out in total.

"Okay, so we have 4 adults and 8 kids who want to share 8 chocolate bars.  Each adult gets 6, so that's 24 chocolate bars.  The kids get 40 chocolate bars.  That means there are 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars left.

"Susan works for 3 hours.  She earns $18 for that time.  She takes a break for 30 minutes.  She earns $15 more after her break.  So, she earns $18 + $15 = $33.

"Okay, here's how we can figure out the total points:

* **Mike:** Mike has 21 points.
* **Jim:** Jim has 3 less points than Mike, so he has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
* **Tony:** Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 = 42 points.
* **Round 4:** Everyone gets 1 point extra if they have more than 20 points.
    * Mike: 21 + 1 = 22 points
    * Jim: 18 + 1 = 19 points
    * Tony: 42 + 1 = 43 points
* **Total:** Mike + Jim + Tony = 22 + 19 + 43 = 84 points

So the answer is 84.

"Okay, so Darren does pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses.  On the first day he does 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses.  On the second day, he does more pushups, fewer squats, and double the dumbbell presses.  How many pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses does he do in two days?

**Here are the answers:**

* **Pushups:** 100 + 120 = 220
* **Squats:** 50 + 40 = 90
* **Dumbbell Presses:** 20 + 40 = 60

**Total:** 220 + 90 + 60 = 370 

**So the answer is 370.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the ice cream is cheaper now, but we need to know how much the milk costs first. 

* **Ice cream:**  The ice cream is $13, and now it's $11. That means we save $2 for each tub.
* **Milk:** We need to know how much the milk costs before we can figure out how much we save on it. 

Let's say the milk costs $2. 

* **Ice cream:** 2 tubs cost $26.
* **Milk:** 4 packets cost $8 (because we need to know the original price of the milk to calculate the discount).

**So, we need to know the price of the milk to figure out how much we save!**

"Quinn is 30 years old.  To find Trent's age, we need to know how old Trent is compared to Jane.  Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so she is 30 - 3 = 27 years old. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so he is 27 + 5 = 32 years old.

"Okay, here's how we can figure this out:

* Cera is 46 years old now.
* Six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age, so he was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* So, the population of Chile now is 60,000 + 6 = 60,006. 


**Answer:** 60,006

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know there are 105 players on the whole team.
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense.
* The special teams have half as many players as the defense.

Let's use some numbers to help us figure it out:

* Let's say there are 'x' players on the defense. 
* The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.
* The special teams have half as many players as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

Now, let's add all the players together: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for 'x', we need to find the number of players on the defense. 

Let's combine the 'x' terms: (5/2)x + x = 105

Now, we can solve for 'x':

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 5x + 2x = 210
* Combine the 'x' terms: 7x = 210
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

So, there are **30** players on the defense!

"The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.  To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to know how much space it takes up.  

* **Think of it like a big box:** The pool is like a big box that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. 
* **How much space does it take up?**  We need to multiply the length, width, and depth to find out how much space the pool takes up. 
* **Multiplying the numbers:** 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet = 120 cubic feet.
* **How much does it cost per cubic foot?** It costs $0.10 per cubic foot.
* **Now we can find the total cost:** 120 cubic feet x $0.10/cubic foot = $12.00

**Answer:** $12.00

"Okay, so we know there are 30 boys in the classroom.  Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, there are 3 * 30 = 90 girls.  And since there are 1/10 as many non-gendered kids as boys, there are (1/10) * 30 = 3 non-gendered kids.  So, the total number of kids is 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 kids.

"Okay, so we know that for every pole, we need 3 wires.  We also know there are 45 wires in total.  To find out how many poles we need, we can think of it like this:

* If we have 45 wires, and each wire needs to be connected to a pole, we need to figure out how many poles we need. 
* We can do this by dividing the total number of wires by the number of wires per pole. 
* So, 45 wires / 3 wires per pole = 15 poles.

Let's try to figure it out!

"Okay, so we know there are 100 people working at the company.  

*  Junior programmers make up half the people, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 junior programmers.
* Each junior programmer makes $2000 a month.
* Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2000 + $400 = $2400 a month.
*  The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers is $2000 * 50 + $2400 * 60 = $100,000 + $144,000 = $244,000. 


**Answer:** $244,000

"Okay, so we know there were 20 people going to the third stop.  Let's think about how many people got on the bus at the beginning.  

* **First stop:** 5 more people got on the bus.
* **Second stop:** 7 people got off, and 8 more got on.

So, we know there were 11 people at the second stop.  

Let's think about how many people got on the bus at the terminal. 


**Answer:** 6 people

"Okay, so we need to figure out which job pays more money.

* **Job A:**  This job pays $15 an hour, and you work 2000 hours a year. That's a lot of hours!  
* **Job B:** This job pays $42,000 a year. That's a lot of money!

Now, let's see how much money each job pays after taxes.

* **Job A:**  The tax rate is 20%. That means they take 20% of your money.  So, after taxes, you get $24,000.
* **Job B:**  First, they take $6,000 for property tax. Then, they take 10% of the rest of your money. That's $3,600 in taxes.  So, after taxes, you get $32,400.

**Which job pays more?**

* **Job A:** $24,000
* **Job B:** $32,400

Job B pays more!

"Okay, so we know there are 220 castles in Scotland.  40% of them are ruined.  Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.  So, we need to figure out how many of those ruined castles are unmanned.

* **Ruined castles:** 220 castles * 40% = 88 castles
* **Unmanned ruined castles:** 88 castles / 2 = 44 castles

"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals.  He has twice as many chickens as cows.  Let's think about this:

* **Let's use letters to help us:**  We can use the letter ""c"" for the number of chickens and ""w"" for the number of cows.

* **We know:**
    *  c + w = 60 (all the animals together)
    *  c = 2w (chickens are twice as many as cows)

* **Let's solve for the number of cows:**  Since we know c = 2w, we can substitute that into the first equation: 2w + w = 60.  That means 3w = 60.  To find out how many cows there are, we divide both sides by 3: w = 20.

* **Now we know how many cows there are, let's find the number of chickens:**  We know c = 2w, so we can plug in 20 for w: c = 2 * 20 = 40.

* **Finally, let's count the legs!**  Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4.  So, we have 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs, and 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.  That means there are a total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs.


**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

"Josh starts with 3 balls and gets better each week.  He adds 1 ball each week.  So after 4 weeks, he has 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 balls.  Then he drops 3 balls, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 balls left.  One ball gets lost, so he has 2 - 1 = 1 ball left. 

**Answer:** 1 ball

"Okay, let's solve this!

* The pink frog is 50 pounds.
* The blue beetle is also 50 pounds.
* The green toad is also 50 pounds.
* The yellow snake is 60 pounds.
* The red bird is 30 pounds.

So, the total weight of all the animals is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 220 pounds. 

And the container weighs 20 pounds.

The total weight of everything is 220 + 20 = 240 pounds.

"Davos bought two shirts for $30 each.  He got a 40% discount, so he paid less.  To find out how much he paid, we need to figure out how much he saved.  He saved $30 * 0.40 = $12.  Then, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.  So, he paid $30 * 2 - $12 = $60 - $12 = $48. 


**Answer:** $48

"They are making 10% more now! 

Here's why:

* They used to make 10 tractors a day and each one was $100. That's $1000 a day.
* Now they make 5 silos a day and each one is $220. That's $1100 a day.
* The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100.
* That's $100 more than they made before! 
* To find out what percentage that is, we divide the extra money by the old money: $100 / $1000 = 0.1.
* Then we multiply by 100 to get a percentage: 0.1 * 100 = 10%.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Morgan has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to do mini-golf, go-karts, and play at the arcade. 

* Mini-golf costs $5 per person.
* Go-karts cost $10 each.

To figure out how many friends she can invite, let's think about how much money she has left after each activity.

**Here's what we know:**

* **Mini-golf:** $5 per person * number of friends
* **Go-karts:** $10 per ride * number of rides
* **Total cost:** $5 (mini-golf) + $10 (go-karts) * number of friends 
* **Total budget:** $90

**Let's see how many friends she can invite:**

We need to figure out how much money she has left after doing mini-golf and go-karts. 

**Here are the options:**

1. **Option 1:** She can invite 1 friend to mini-golf and 1 friend to go-karts.
2. **Option 2:** She can invite 2 friends to mini-golf and 1 friend to go-karts.
3. **Option 3:** She can invite 3 friends to mini-golf and 1 friend to go-karts.
4. **Option 4:** She can invite 4 friends to mini-golf and 1 friend to go-karts.

"Carver is 45 years old.  Twice his age is 2 * 45 = 90 years.  Five years less than twice his age is 90 - 5 = 85 years.  So, Carver's son is 85 - 5 = 80 years old. 

**Answer: 80**

"Okay, so the train goes to three cities.  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, then 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and then 50 miles less than that to go from the third city to the first city.  That's a total of 225 miles for one trip.  The train does this trip three times a day.  To figure out how many days it takes to go 18,000 miles, we need to divide the total distance by the number of miles the train travels in a day.  So, we divide 18,000 miles by 675 miles, which is about 26.67 days.  So, the train needs service every 27 days.

"Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing. 

Here's how we know:

*  He makes beds for different sizes of dogs.
*  A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
*  A chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
*  A collie bed needs the average of the other two, which is 5 pounds.
*  He makes 4 chihuahua beds, so he needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
*  He makes 3 collie beds, so he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.
*  To find the total, we add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds: 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

"Okay, so we know 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. Then 4 times that number, which is 12 people, were kicked out for shoplifting.  And then 3 times the number of shoplifters, which is 21 people, were kicked out for being violent.  To find out how many people were kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract all the other reasons from the total number of people kicked out.  So, 50 people - 12 - 21 - 7 = 10 people.

"Okay, let's figure out how much it will cost to give out the awards!

* **Picture frames:** 44 seniors need frames, and each one costs $20. So that's 44 * $20 = $880.
* **Etching:** Each frame needs a special logo that costs an extra $20. That's $880 * 0.20 = $176 more.
* **Total for frames:** $880 + $176 = $1056
* **Pins:** Two seniors get pins that cost $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.
* **Cords:**  One-fourth of the seniors are officers, and they need cords that cost $12 each. That's (1/4) * 44 * $12 = $132.
* **Total cost:** $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1298

"Let's figure out how much money Axel and Anna have together!

* Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.
* Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.
* Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
* Together, they have 50 + 80 = 130 pesos from Axel.
* Anna has 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.
* So, they have a total of 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

We know Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares of land left after selling some.  We also know he had 3/5 of his land, which is like taking a part of the whole.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what that 3/5 part is.

*  If he has 12.8 hectares left, and he had 3/5 of his land, that means he had 12.8 * 5 / 3 = 21.33 hectares. 

**Answer:** Mr. Ruther had 21.33 hectares of land at first.

"Wilson needs a grade of 80 or higher in math to get the car.  Let's see what his average is:

* He got 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74 on his tests.
*  To find his average, we add all the numbers together: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400
*  We divide the total by the number of tests: 400 / 5 = 80

So, Wilson's grade is 80!

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* Betty and Sam have popsicles in a ratio of 5:6. That means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.
* Together they have 165 popsicles.
* To find out how many popsicles each person has, we need to figure out what each part of the ratio is worth. 
* If they have 165 popsicles total, and the ratio is 5:6, we can divide the total popsicles by the total ratio parts: 165 popsicles / 11 parts = 15 popsicles per part.
* Betty has 5 parts, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
* Sam has 6 parts, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.
* Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Okay, so Carol writes a song for 4 hours. Then she records it for half that time, which is 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours.  She also spends 90 minutes editing. 

To find out what percentage of her time she spent editing, we need to figure out how many minutes she spent editing. 90 minutes is equal to 90/60 = 1.5 hours.

Now, let's add up all the time she spent: 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours.

Finally, we can find the percentage of time she spent editing by dividing the time spent editing by the total time and then multiplying by 100%. 

So, 90 minutes / 7.5 hours = 12 minutes. 

Then, we multiply that by 100% to get 12/7.5 * 100% = 16%. 


**Answer:** 16%

"Okay, so Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of power every hour. He uses it for 8 hours a day.  That means it uses 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours each day. 

If he uses it for 3 hours less, it uses 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours each day.

He saves 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours each day.

That's a lot of energy! Over 30 days, he saves 4500 watt-hours * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.

To make it easier to understand, we can convert that to kilowatt-hours.  That's like saying how much electricity he uses in a ""power hour"".  So, 135,000 watt-hours is equal to 135 kilowatt-hours. 



**Answer: 135 kWh**

"Okay, here's how to figure out the average number of stripes:

* **Zebra 1 and Zebra 2:** They have a total of 2 zebras * 17 stripes/zebra = 34 stripes.
* **Zebra 3:** It has 36 stripes.
* **Zebra 3's stripes:**  We need to add the stripes from Zebra 3 to the total stripes from Zebra 1 and Zebra 2. 36 stripes + 34 stripes = 70 stripes.
* **Total stripes:**  We need to add the stripes from all the zebras. 70 stripes + 36 stripes = 106 stripes.
* **Average stripes:** We need to divide the total stripes by the number of zebras. 106 stripes / 3 zebras = 35.33 stripes/zebra.

**Answer:** 35.33

"Tim bought fireworks for the Fourth of July! He spent $400 on one pack and another pack that was twice as much, so he spent $400 * 2 = $800.  Then, he bought a special firework for $150.  The fireworks cost $400 + $800 = $1200 before he got a discount.  The store gave him a discount of 20% off the price, so he paid $1200 - $240 = $960.  Finally, he bought one more firework for $150, so he spent a total of $960 + $150 = $1110. 

**Answer:** $1110

* Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
* Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so her sister gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples.

* Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister. 
* The sisters have a total of 500 apples. 

Let's think about how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

"Okay, so we have camels and dromedaries.  We know there are 180 heads in total.  We also know that camels have two humps and dromedaries have one.  Let's use that to figure out how many of each there are!

We can write down the information like this:

*  Camels + Dromedaries = 180 heads
*  Camels have 2 humps, Dromedaries have 1 hump.

To figure out how many of each there are, we need to use some math. 

**Think about it like this:**

* If we have 180 heads, and we know camels have 2 humps each, we can figure out how many camels there are. 
* We can do the same thing with the dromedaries.


Let me know if you want to try solving it!

"Okay, so Bill gets a deal for the first six months, then it goes up a little bit.  Then it goes up again after eight months.  

Here's how much it costs:

* **First six months:** $8 a month * 6 months = $48
* **Next two months:** $12 a month * 2 months = $24
* **Next six months:** $14 a month * 6 months = $84
* **Total cost for 8 months:** $48 + $24 + $84 = $156

To get the cost for two years, we need to know how many months are in two years. There are 24 months in two years. 

* **Total cost for two years:** $156 * 2 = $312 


**Answer:** $312

"Okay, so Cole wants new jeans for a dance contest. He finds two kinds: tattered jeans and jogger jeans.  The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than that.  He saves $6 in total.  

Let's see how much each kind of jeans cost:

* **Tattered jeans:** $28
* **Jogger jeans:** $28 - $6 = $22

He saved $6 from the total, so he saved $6 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans.

The jogger jeans cost $18 before he saved any money. 

The difference between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans is $18 - $28 = $10. 


**Answer:** $10

"Okay, let's figure out how many people can go on the trip!

* **Buses:**  They have 60 people on each bus, and we have 4 buses, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.
* **Minibuses:**  Each minibus can hold 30 people, and we have 6 minibuses, so that's 30 * 6 = 180 people.
* **Minivans:** Each minivan can hold 15 people, and we have 10 vans, so that's 15 * 10 = 150 people.

Now, let's add all the people together: 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 people!

"Indras' name has 6 letters. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.  

* **Half of Indras' name:** 6 letters / 2 = 3 letters

"Okay, so Antoine wants to make soup for 6 people. He needs 4 pounds of onions because he wants to double the amount.  The onions are $2.00 a pound, so that's $8.00 for all of them. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are $2.00 each, so that's $4.00.  So, the total cost is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.  That means each person will pay $12.00 / 6 people = $2.00 per person.

"Okay, so we know the area of Billie's room is 360 square feet.  We also know the length is 3 yards, which is like 3 times 3 feet, so it's 9 feet long.  To find the perimeter, we need to know the width.  We can do that by using the area.  Area is length times width.  So, 360 square feet is 9 feet times the width.  That means the width is 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.  Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides.  The perimeter is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width.  So, it's 2 * 9 feet + 2 * 40 feet = 18 feet + 80 feet = 98 feet. 


**Answer:** 98

"Okay, so Elizabeth has 60 beads and Margareth has 140 beads.

"Okay, so Jon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run.  James is faster than Jon, but takes a little longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did it take James to run?

**Here's what we know:**

* Jon's swim is 40 minutes.
* Jon's bike is 70 minutes.
* Jon's run is 50 minutes.
* Jon won by 10 minutes.

**Let's figure out James's run time:**

* James is faster than Jon, so his swim is a little faster.

"Beatrice bought 112 colors of crayons! 

Here's how we know:

* She got 6 packets with 8 colors each, so that's 6 * 8 = 48 colors.
* She also got 4 packets with 16 colors each, so that's 4 * 16 = 64 colors.
*  To find the total, we add the colors from both groups: 48 + 64 = 112 colors.

"The car drives for 2 hours at 60 miles per hour, then for 1 hour at 30 miles per hour.  To find the average speed, we need to add up the distance and divide by the total time. 

* **Distance:** 120 miles (first part) + 30 miles (second part) = 150 miles
* **Time:** 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours
* **Average Speed:** 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour 

So the answer is 50 miles per hour.

"The farmer needs to make 2 trips to bring all the feed. 

Here's why:

* He needs to bring enough hay for all the horses.
* He needs enough carrots for the horses.
* He needs enough sugar cubes for the horses.
* He needs enough oats for the horses. 

Let's think about how much of each thing he needs:

* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
* Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Now, let's add all the weights together: 3150 + 48 + 2 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farmer can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, he needs to make 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

"Okay, so we have 30 students and each starts with 10 pencils.  After two months, they use some pencils, and then there are only some left.  We need to figure out how many pencils are left. 

Let's think about it:

* **First, we need to figure out how many pencils they used.**  They used 1/5 of the pencils, which is like taking away 1/5 of 30 pencils.  That's like taking away 6 pencils.
* **Then, we need to figure out how many pencils are left.**  They had 294 pencils left after the first two months.
* **Finally, we need to figure out how many pencils are left after the end of the year.**  We know 1/3 of the pencils are left. 

So, we need to find out how many pencils are left after 1/3 of the pencils are left.

"The remoras are like little fish that stick to the shark!  They're like tiny friends!  

If the shark is 120 inches long, and the remoras are 72 inches long, that's a big chunk of the shark's body! 

To figure out what percentage of the shark's body the remoras make up, we need to divide the remora's length by the shark's length and then multiply by 100. 

So, 72 inches / 120 inches = 0.6.  Then we multiply that by 100 to get 60%. 

So the answer is 60%.

"Okay, let's find the average temperature! 

We need to add up the highest temperatures from all the countries: -48°F + 21°F + (-3°F) = -20°F

"Okay, so Heather gets two razors for the price of one because of a sale.  She also has a coupon for $2.00 off.  So, how much will each razor cost?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **The sale price:**  Heather gets two razors for $4.00, so each razor costs $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.
* **The coupon:** She gets $2.00 off, so the price is $2.00 - $2.00 = $0.00.
* **The final price:** Each razor costs $0.00, so it costs 0 cents!


 
**Answer:** 0 cents

"Okay, so we have 9 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one is 60 inches tall.  We need to figure out how tall the pyramid is.

First, we know the bottom row is 4 cheerleaders tall, and they are all 64 inches.  So, that's 4 * 64 = 256 inches.

Then, the next row has 3 cheerleaders, and they are also 64 inches tall.  So, that's 3 * 64 = 192 inches.

The next row has 2 cheerleaders, and they are also 64 inches tall.  So, that's 2 * 64 = 128 inches.

Now, we add all the heights together: 256 + 192 + 128 = 576 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 576 inches / 12 inches/foot = 48 feet.

So, the pyramid is 48 feet tall!

"Okay, so Mark has two choices for his wife's party.  

* **Choice 1:**  It costs $200 no matter how many people come.
* **Choice 2:** It costs $25 for each person who comes.  But, the food is already included!

To figure out which is cheaper, we need to find out how many people Mark needs to invite to make the two choices the same price. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Choice 1:**  The cost is $200, and then we add $5 for each person.
* **Choice 2:** The cost is $25 for each person, and we don't need to add anything else.

So, we need to find out how many people Mark needs to invite to make the two choices the same price.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* **Bodhi found some insects:**  Let's say Bodhi found 'x' insects.
* **David found half:** David found half of what Bodhi found, so he found x/2 insects.
* **Lily found more:** Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (x/2) + 7 insects.

Now, all together they found 43 insects.  We can write this as an equation:

x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Let's solve for x:

1. Combine the 'x' terms: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43
2. Simplify: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
3. Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
4. Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
5. Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now we know Bodhi found 14.4 insects.  

To find out how many insects Lily found, we use the equation: (x/2) + 7

Let's plug in the value of x: (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Okay, so Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn and Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.  That's a total of 1/2 + 1/4.  To find the total amount of yarn, we need to find a common denominator.  The common denominator is 4.  So, 1/2 is the same as 2/4.  Now we have 2/4 + 1/4.  That's 3/4 of a skein.  And since there are 364 yards in a skein, they used 3/4 * 364 yards = 273 yards of yarn. 


**Answer:** 273

"Cherrie needs to buy gifts for 5 friends.  Two of them want 5 gifts each, and the other three want 2 gifts each.  That's a total of 10 gifts for the first two friends and 6 gifts for the other three.  She buys 10 more gifts.  So, she buys a total of 10 + 6 + 10 = 26 gifts. 

**Answer:** 26

"The chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider, so it's 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.  Twice the width of the rug is 8 * 2 = 16 feet. The couch is 2 feet longer than that, so it's 16 + 2 = 18 feet long. 

**Answer:** 18 feet

"Okay, so Mario has 6 dogs, and each dog needs a pair of snowshoes.  Since each pair costs $12, we need to figure out how many pairs of snowshoes he needs.  

* He has 6 dogs, and each dog needs 2 legs, so he needs 6 dogs / 2 legs per pair = 3 pairs of snowshoes.
*  That means he needs to buy 3 pairs of snowshoes.
*  Each pair costs $12, so he'll spend 3 pairs * $12/pair = $36.00

"The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so they have 30 cows * 2 = 60 cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so they have 20 sheep / 2 = 10 sheep.  The farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals. The zoo has 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.  So, the farm and zoo have a total of 40 animals + 80 animals = 120 animals.

"Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July 19th.  He needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound.  To figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we need to know how many days are left. 

Let's count the days: December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days, March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. That's a total of 211 days.

So, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories per pound, and he wants to lose 30 pounds. That means he needs to burn 3500 * 30 = 105,000 calories.

To figure out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 211 days = 500 calories per day.

* The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add all the thicknesses together: 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.

So the answer is 188 mm.

"Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to make a play set five times bigger than James's. James has 80 toys.  To make a play set five times bigger, we need 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  So, Jonathan needs 400 - 2 = 398 toys.  

**Answer:** 398

"Okay, so Daniel wants to buy notebooks, pens, a calculator, and a geometry set.  

* Notebooks cost $1.50 each, so five notebooks cost 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
* Pens cost $0.25 each, so two pens cost 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
* A calculator costs $12.00
* A geometry set costs $10.00

That's a total of $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

The shop gives a discount, so he has to pay $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00

Here's how we figure that out:

* **First part:** She sold $1000 worth of goods, and she gets 30% of that, which is $300.
* **Second part:** She sold more than $1000, so she gets 10% of the extra amount, which is $150.
* **Total:** She got $300 + $150 = $450.

"There are 7 buttons with two holes, and the rest have four holes.  So, we need to find the total number of holes on the buttons with four holes.  There are 14 buttons with four holes, and each button has 4 holes, so there are 14 * 4 = 56 holes.  Finally, we need to add the holes on the buttons with two holes.  There are 7 buttons with two holes, and each button has 2 holes, so there are 7 * 2 = 14 holes.  So, there are 56 + 14 = 70 holes in all the buttons.

"Okay, here's how to figure out the average weight:

* **Susan's weight:** Mark is 150 pounds, and Susan is 20 pounds less, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.
* **Bob's weight:** Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.
* **Total weight:**  Mark, Susan, and Bob together weigh 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.
* **Average weight:**  To find the average, we divide the total weight by the number of people: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

"Here's how to solve this:

* Shiloh is 44 years old now.
* In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
*  We know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

"Mack saw a total of 280 birds over the week.  He saw birds every day except for day three.  To find the average, we need to divide the total number of birds by the number of days. 

So, 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds per day. 

**Answer:** 40

"Okay, so the oven is a little bit too hot!  If it's 18 degrees hotter than what Maggie set it to, we need to add that to the recipe's temperature. 

Here's how:

* The recipe needs 520 degrees.
* The oven is 18 degrees hotter than what Maggie set it to.
* We need to add 18 degrees to the recipe's temperature.

So, the oven needs to be set to 520 + 18 = 538 degrees. 


**Answer:** 538 degrees

"Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.  So, we need to find out how much Juan's house costs. 

Herb's house costs $76,000.  If we take 30% of that, we get $76,000 * 0.30 = $22,800.  

So, Juan's house costs $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Finally, we need to add the prices of both houses together.  That's $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200. 

**Answer:** $129,200

"Okay, so Judy brought 12 cups.  She brought twice as many dishes as cups, so she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes.  

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

Together, they brought 12 + 24 = 36 cups and 40 + 60 = 100 dishes.

So, they brought a total of 36 + 100 = 136 utensils. 

**Answer:** 136

"Okay, so the jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans.  The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, and 1% more green jelly beans than blue.  

Let's think about it like this:

* **Blue jelly beans:** We know there are a certain number of blue jelly beans.
* **Red jelly beans:** There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, so we need to figure out how many less.
* **Green jelly beans:** There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, so we need to figure out how many more.

To figure out how many more green jelly beans there are than red, we need to know how many of each there are. 


Let me know if you want to try to figure out how many of each there are!

"Okay, so Jared started typing at 47 words per minute. Then he got better and typed 52 words per minute.  He keeps getting faster! If he goes even faster, he'll be typing 57 words per minute.  To find the average, we need to add all his speeds and then divide by 3.  So, 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Then, 156 / 3 = 52.  So the answer is 52.

"The first dog was a small dog called an Affenpinscher, and he weighed 10 pounds. The next dog was a Dachshund, and he was twice as heavy as the Affenpinscher. So the Dachshund weighed 20 pounds. The next dog was a Papillon, and he was one-fourth as heavy as the Dachshund. So the Papillon weighed 5 pounds. The last dog was a Mastiff, and he was 44 times heavier than the Papillon. So the Mastiff weighed 44 times 5 pounds, which is 220 pounds.

"Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  So, if he is x years old now, he was x-5 years old five years ago.  

To find out how old he'll be in three years, we need to add three to his current age. 

Let's think about it:

* If Jerry is x years old now, he was x-5 years old five years ago.
* We know he's twice as old now as he was five years ago. 
* So, x = 2(x-5)

Let's solve for x:

* x = 2x - 10
* x - 2x = -10
* -x = -10
* x = 10

So, Jerry is 10 years old now. In three years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"George needs to pay for two implants, and each one costs $2000.  He also wants a special crown for one of them, which costs $500 more.  He's already paid $600.  So, the total cost is $2000 + $500 = $2500.  He needs to pay $5000 for the two implants.  He has $600 already.  So, he needs to work to get $5000 - $600 = $4400.  To get $4400, he needs to work $4400 / $15 per hour = 293.33 hours.

"Okay, so we know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's think about the angles:

* One angle is twice the smallest angle.
* Another angle is three times the smallest angle.

Let's say the smallest angle is 'x'.  

* The other angle is twice the smallest, so it's 2x.
* The other angle is three times the smallest, so it's 3x.

Now, we know all the angles add up to 180 degrees.  So, we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Let's solve for x:

* Combine the 'x' terms: 6x = 180
* Divide both sides by 6: x = 30

Now, we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The largest angle is three times the smallest, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

**Answer:** 90 degrees

"Colby has a lot of money! He has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies.  Let's see how many gumballs he can buy. 

* **Quarters:** 8 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $2.00
* **Dimes:** 6 dimes * $0.10/dime = $0.60
* **Nickels:** 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70
* **Pennies:** 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15
* **Total money:** $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45
* **Gumballs:** $3.45 / $0.05/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs!

"The pets have a total of 48 legs. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* Dogs have 4 legs each.
* Cats have 4 legs each.
* Birds have 2 legs each.

Let's count them up:

* Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
* Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
* Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

So, 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs!

"Okay, so Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.  Marissa makes 3/4 of that amount in one hour.  If they work for 12 hours, how much chocolate did they make together?

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Ruiz's chocolate:** Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, so in one hour, he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds.
* **Marissa's chocolate:** Marissa makes 3/4 of Ruiz's amount, so she makes (3/4) * 60 pounds = 45 pounds per hour.
* **Total chocolate:**  They make 60 pounds + 45 pounds = 105 pounds in one hour.
* **Total chocolate in 12 hours:** They make 105 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 1260 pounds of chocolate together.

**Answer:** 1260

"Okay, so Jeremy drives 400 miles.  That's like driving a long way!  Each tire goes around 725 times for every two miles.  So, how many times does it go around for 400 miles?  

*  We need to multiply the number of miles by the number of times the tire goes around. 
*  That's 400 miles * 725 times = 290,000 times.

Now, we know that each tire can go around 10,440,000 times.  So, how many years will it take for the tire to go around that many times?

*  We need to divide the total number of times the tire can go around by the number of times it goes around for 400 miles. 
*  That's 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 36. 

So, it will take about 36 years for the tire to need to be replaced.

"Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and Monica's street is 150 meters long.  To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to find the difference in cost. 

Here's how:

* **Monica's street cost:** $194 per meter * 150 meters = $29,100
* **Lewis' street cost:** $194 per meter * 490 meters = $95,660
* **Difference:** $95,660 - $29,100 = $66,560

So, it costs $66,560 more to repave Lewis' street.

"There are 4 rows of seats in the auditorium. Each row has 18 seats.  

*  The administrators took up one-fourth of the seats, which is 18 seats / 4 = 4.5 seats. Since we can't have half a seat, we know that not all the seats were used by the administrators.

"Okay, so a diamond is $2000.  The gold is 4/5 of that, which is $2000 * (4/5) = $1600.  The silver is $400 less than the gold, so it's $1600 - $400 = $1200.  Finally, all three together cost $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800. 

**Answer:** $4800

"Okay, so Jewel works 50 customers a day. Julie works twice as fast as Jewel, so she works 50 * 2 = 100 customers a day. 

If they both work every day of the week, Julie works 100 customers a day * 7 days a week = 700 customers a week. Jewel works 50 customers a day * 7 days a week = 350 customers a week.

So, together they work 700 + 350 = 1050 customers a week. 

**Answer:** 1050

"Okay, so we know apples cost $1.30 each and oranges cost $1.10 each.  

* 5 apples cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50
* 5 oranges cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50

So, 5 apples and 5 oranges cost $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00 

**Answer:** $12.00 
"
"Okay, so Bob wants to dig a big hole! It's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  To figure out how long it will take him, we need to think about how much dirt he's moving. 

* **Volume:**  Imagine the hole is like a big box.  The volume is how much space the box takes up.  We need to multiply the length, width, and depth to find the volume: 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.

* **Time:**  It takes Bob 3 seconds to move one cubic foot of dirt. So, to find out how long it takes to move 72 cubic feet, we divide: 72 cubic feet / 3 seconds/cubic foot = 24 seconds.

**Answer:** It will take Bob 24 seconds to dig the hole.

"Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  His son is half Steve's age, so he is 60 / 2 = 30 years old. His wife is 3 years younger than his wife, so she is 64 - 3 = 61 years old. 

**Answer:** 61

"Alisa biked for 4.5 hours at 12 miles per hour. That's 4.5 * 12 = 54 miles. 

Stanley biked for 2.5 hours at 10 miles per hour. That's 2.5 * 10 = 25 miles.

Together, they biked 54 + 25 = 79 miles. 

**Answer:** 79

"Okay, so Bill wants to dig a well.  He can dig through soil really fast, like 4 feet every hour. But clay is a bit slower, he only digs 2 feet every hour in clay.

He needs to dig 24 feet of soil and 8 feet of clay.  

* **To find out how long it takes him to dig the soil, we divide the total soil he needs to dig by how fast he digs through soil:** 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

* **Now, to find out how long it takes him to dig the clay, we divide the total clay he needs to dig by how fast he digs through clay:** 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

* **Finally, to find the total time, we add the time it takes to dig the soil and the time it takes to dig the clay:** 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

"Okay, so Clara bought pomegranates on Tuesday for $20 each, and she got $2 off.  That means she paid $18 per pomegranate.  Then, the price went up to $30 on Wednesday.  She got a discount of 10% off the total price.  So, she paid $540 for 20 pomegranates.  The difference between the two prices is $180. 

**Answer:** $180 
"
"Okay, so Ariadne sells red hats and green hats.  She made $400 from red hats and half that amount from green hats, so she made $200 from green hats.  That means she made $600 in total in the first month.  In the second month, she made 3/4 of what she made in the first month, which is $450.  So, in two months, she made $600 + $450 = $1050. 

**Answer:** $1050

"James paid $45 for the carriage ride. 

Here's why:

* He used the carriage for 4 hours.
* The first hour cost $15.
* The rest of the hours cost twice as much as the first hour, so they cost $30.
*  So, the total cost is $15 + $30 = $45.

"Sally's bank account has $420 now, and she started with $200. That means she earned $420 - $200 = $220 this week.  Since her expected wage is $300, she must have been paid $300 - $220 = $80 less than her expected wage. 

**Answer:** $80

"Okay, so James bought a plane for $150,000.  He has to pay $5000 a month to keep it in a hangar.  He also spends twice as much on fuel each month as that.  To figure out how much it costs him to have the plane for a whole year, we need to add up all the costs. 

* **Fuel:** He spends twice as much on fuel as the hangar, so he spends $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel each month.
* **Total monthly cost:**  He spends $5000 on the hangar plus $10,000 on fuel, so that's $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000 each month.
* **Yearly cost:**  He spends $15,000 each month, so in a year, it'll cost him $15,000 * 12 months = $180,000.

So, it cost James $180,000 to get and keep the plane for a whole year.

"Okay, so Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes. Pork took a little longer, 20 more minutes than rice.  Beans took half the time of rice and pork together.  So, how long did it take to cook all the food? 

* **A.** 30 minutes
* **B.** 40 minutes
* **C.** 50 minutes
* **D.** 120 minutes 

Let's think about it!

"The difference in cost is $3. 

**Answer:**  3 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know Lee has sheep and geese.  We know the total number of legs is 70, and the total number of heads is 20.  

Let's use some simple math to figure out how many sheep are on the farm.

* **Think about it like this:** Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs.  
* **We can write this as an equation:** 4 times the number of sheep (s) plus 2 times the number of geese (g) equals 70.
* **We also know that the number of sheep (s) plus the number of geese (g) equals 20.**

Let's solve for 's' (the number of sheep). 

* **We can use the second equation to help us:**  s + g = 20
* **Let's solve for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
* **Now we can put 'g' into the first equation:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
* **Let's simplify:** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70
* **Combine the 's' terms:** 2s + 40 = 70
* **Subtract 40 from both sides:** 2s = 30
* **Divide both sides by 2:** s = 15

**So, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm!**

"Okay, so Roger wants coffee.  The regular coffee is $5 a pound.  But the other kind is more expensive, because it's a little bit pricier.  He needs a pound of coffee every day for a week.  He also wants a donut, which costs $2.  How much does it all cost?

"If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, how many does Sally have?

Here's how to solve it:

* Let's think of Sally's books as ""x"".
* Twice the number of Sally's books is 2 * x.
* Janey has 3 more than twice Sally's books, so she has 2 * x + 3.
* We know Janey has 21 books, so we can write an equation: 2 * x + 3 = 21

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 3 from both sides: 2 * x = 18
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

Sally has 9 books. 


**Answer: 9**

"Okay, so three people put money in a savings account together. Dylan put in 2/5 of the money, which is like 2 out of 5 parts.  Frances then put in 2/3 of what was left.  So, we need to figure out how much money was left after Dylan's part.  The rest is for Skyler. 

Let's say the total money is 100. Dylan put in 2/5 of 100, which is 40.  So, after Dylan's part, there is 100 - 40 = 60 left. Frances then put in 2/3 of 60, which is 40.  So, the rest is for Skyler.  

Skyler put in 60 - 40 = 20.

Let's think about it like this:

* We know 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.
* We want to know how many hash browns we can make with 96 potatoes.

To find out, we can use a little trick!  We can think of it like this:

* If we have 6 potatoes, and they make 36 hash browns, we can see that we can make 36 hash browns with 6 potatoes.
* We can also see that we can make 96 hash browns with 96 potatoes. 

So, the answer is 576!

"Okay, so Shania wants to make her dress longer. She makes it 50% longer, which means she adds half of its original length. Then she adds 20 centimeters of lace.  

If the final dress is 140 centimeters long, how long was the dress originally? 

a) 60 centimeters
b) 93 centimeters
c) 120 centimeters
d) 140 centimeters


Let's think about it:

* If the dress is 140 centimeters long, and she added 20 centimeters of lace, that means the dress was 140 - 20 = 120 centimeters long before the lace. 
* To make it 140 centimeters long, she added 140 - 120 = 20 centimeters. 
* She added 20 centimeters to the dress, so the original dress was 20 centimeters longer.

"Greta baked 30 cookies, and Celinda baked twice as many, so Celinda baked 60 cookies. Together they baked 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.  After they ate 10 cookies, they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left. 

**Answer:** 80

"Let's think about this!

* We know there are twins and triplets.
* One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
* Their ages add up to 44.

Let's use some numbers to help us:

* Let's say the twin's age is 't'.
* The triplet's age is '3t' (because they are triplets).

Now, we know that 't' + '3t' = 44.  

Let's solve for 't':

* 4t = 44

"Okay, here's how to figure that out:

* **Lollipops:**  Manolo bought 5 lollipops, and each lollipop costs $0.40. So, 5 lollipops cost 5 * $0.40 = $2.00
* **Candies:**  He also bought 4 candies, and they cost $3.20.
* **Total Cost:** To find the total cost, we add the cost of the lollipops and the candies: $2.00 + $1.20 = $3.20
* **More Lollipops:**  If he buys 10 lollipops, it will cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00
* **More Candies:**  If he buys 10 candies, it will cost 10 * $1.20 = $12.00
* **Total Cost Again:**  So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4.00 + $12.00 = $16.00

"Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins. So Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins each month. 

Over 10 years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins. Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins. 

Together, they save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Okay, let's figure out the price!

* **Bananas cost twice as much as apples, so they cost $0.50 * 2 = $1.00 each.**
* **Oranges are three times more expensive than bananas, so they cost $1.00 * 3 = $3.00 each.**

Now let's add up the cost of all the fruit:

* **Apples cost $0.50 * 12 = $6.00**
* **Bananas cost $1.00 * 5 = $5.00**
* **Oranges cost $3.00 * 7 = $21.00**

The total cost is $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00

**So, the crate of fruit costs $32.00.**

Here's how we know:

* She sees fireworks from the big show: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks
* She sees 40% of the fireworks from the show, so she sees 300 fireworks * 0.40 = 120 fireworks
* She also sets off some fireworks in her backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks
*  So, she sees 120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

"Okay, so Mr. Boarden wants to tile his bathroom.  He needs 24 tiles for every square foot.  He wants to tile two-thirds of his bathroom, which is 36 square feet.  

To find out how many tiles he needs, we need to figure out how many square feet he's tiling.  Two-thirds of 36 is 24.  

So, he needs 24 tiles * 24 square feet = 576 tiles.

"Helga taps her feet really fast!  She taps her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute.  When she raises her arms, she taps slower, but still a lot!  She taps 400 times in two minutes with her arms up.  If she dances for 5 minutes, she taps a total of 2750 times without her arms up.  So, she taps 3550 times in total. 

**Answer:** 3550

"Ron is in a tough spot!  He has a pothole in front of his house that could cost his car $450 to fix.  The city says he can't fix it himself, and if he does, he'll get a fine.  He also has to buy some asphalt, and it costs $25 for each bucket.  

So, how much money does Ron save? 

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Asphalt cost:** He needs 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25, so that's 3 * $25 = $75.
* **Total cost to fix the pothole:**  He'll have to pay $75 for the asphalt plus $120 for the fine, so that's $75 + $120 = $195.
* **Savings:**  If he didn't fix the pothole, it would cost $450 to fix it.  So, he would save $450 - $195 = $255.

"Okay, so there are 60 slices of pizza in total.  Two friends ate 2/3 of them, which is 10 slices.  That leaves 50 slices. The other two friends ate 3/4 of their slices, which is 15 slices.  So, there are 35 slices left. 

**Answer:** 35

"The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes, and the dog eats them in 20 minutes.  To find the average time, we need to add the times together and then divide by the number of animals. 

The cat eats in 30 minutes and the dog eats in 20 minutes. 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 
 
The average time is 50 minutes / 2 animals = 25 minutes. 

**Answer: 25 minutes**

"Topher's shoes are really big!  Let's figure out how long Bobby's shoes are.

We know Topher's shoes are 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoes.  

Let's say Bobby's shoes are 'x' inches long.  

We can write an equation: 100 = 9x + 10

To find out how long Bobby's shoes are, we need to solve for 'x'.  

Let's do that!  

* Subtract 10 from both sides: 90 = 9x
* Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

* **Total:**  Tanya makes $80 on Monday and $30 on Wednesday, so she makes $80 + $30 = $110.

"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday for soccer. That's a total of 12 hours. She also reads for 3 hours and plays video games for 1/3 of the rest of her time. 

To figure out how much time she spends on soccer, we need to figure out how much time is left for soccer after she reads and plays video games. 

She has 12 hours total, and 3 hours for reading, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left. 

Then, she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, which is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

So, she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left for soccer.

To figure out what percentage of her weekend she spends on soccer, we need to divide the time she spends on soccer by the total time she has and multiply by 100. 

That's (6 / 12) * 100 = 50%. 

So, she spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

"Okay, so Mike has 600 movies.  He wants to get rid of his old ones and get digital ones.  

* He has 2/3 of his movies in series, which are like a group of movies.  
* He can get those for only $6 each.
* The rest of his movies are not in series.
* 40% of the rest are old movies, and they cost $5 each.

So, how much does it cost to get all the movies? 

**Here are the options:**

a) $600
b) $2000
c) $6000
d) $1000

**Answer: c) $6000**

"Okay, so Winston picked peaches, plums, and apricots.  

* Peaches cost $2.00 per pound. He picked 6 pounds of peaches, so that's 6 * $2.00 = $12.00
* Plums cost $1.00 per pound. He picked 8 pounds of plums, so that's 8 * $1.00 = $8.00
* Apricots cost $3.00 per pound. He picked 6 pounds of apricots, so that's 6 * $3.00 = $18.00

To find the total, we add up the cost of each kind of fruit: $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.

**b) 330 miles**
**c) 250 miles**
**d) 200 miles**

The answer is **b) 330 miles**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Ava and Emma are playing a game.  They each get points for different things.  Ava gets points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and for how long she takes to finish the level. Emma does the same things, but she gets different numbers of points.

To figure out who wins, we need to know how many points each of them gets for each thing. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Enemies:** Ava jumps on more enemies than Emma.
* **Berries:** Ava gets more berries than Emma.
* **Time:** Ava takes a little longer to finish the level.

We need to figure out how many points each of them gets for each of these things.

"Okay, so we know the two pizzas cost 30 dollars.  We need to find out how much the other two pizzas cost.  

If we subtract the cost of the first two pizzas from the total cost, we can find out how much each of the other two pizzas cost. 

The total cost is 64 dollars and the first two pizzas cost 30 dollars. So, the other two pizzas cost 64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars.

Each of the other two pizzas cost 34 dollars / 2 pizzas = 17 dollars.

"Okay, so Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon of gas.  That means he uses 5 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 0.5 gallons of gas each day to go to work.  He goes to work 5 days a week, so he uses 0.5 gallons/day * 5 days/week = 2.5 gallons of gas each week.  That means he spends $3/gallon * 2.5 gallons = $7.50 on gas each week.

"Okay, so we have third graders, fourth graders, and fifth graders.  

* Third graders: 340 out of 500 passed.
* Fourth graders: 40 out of 100 passed.
* Fifth graders:  They passed twice as many as the fourth graders, so they passed 40 * 2 = 80 out of 500.

To find the overall pass rate, we need to add up the number of students who passed in each grade and then divide by the total number of students. 

* Total passed: 340 + 40 + 80 = 460
* Total students: 500 + 100 + 500 = 1000
* Overall pass rate: 460 / 1000 = 0.46

That's like 46 out of every 100 students passed.  

**Answer:** 46%

"We need to figure out how much tea was at the party before anyone drank any!

*  Four students drank 1.5 quarts each, so they drank a total of 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts.
*  16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.
*  In total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.
*  We started with 10 quarts left, so we need to add the tea they drank to find the total. 10 + 38 = 48 quarts. 

So, there were 48 quarts of tea at the party at the beginning!

"Okay, so Jack and his friends are playing games at the arcade.  Here's how we can figure out how much money they spend:

* **Jack's time:** Jack can play for 20 minutes, and he plays for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
* **Friends' time:** Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes each.  The other friend plays for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes.
* **Total time:**  Jack plays for 240 minutes, and his friends play for 10 minutes + 10 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.
* **Total games:** Jack plays 240 minutes / 20 minutes per game = 12 games.
* **Total cost:** Jack plays 12 games, and each game costs $0.25, so they spend $0.25 * 12 = $3.00.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **We know:** Becca has more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has more than PJ. 
* **Let's use numbers:**  Let's say PJ has 'x' cards.  Smendrick has 3 times that, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so she has 3x + 12 cards.
* **Total cards:**  Together, they have 341 cards.  So, x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341
* **Solve for x:**  We need to find out how many cards PJ has.  Let's add all the cards together: 7x + 12 = 341.  Now, we can find x by subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.  Then, divide both sides by 7: x = 47.  So, PJ has 47 cards.
* **Find Becca's cards:**  Becca has 3 times PJ's cards plus 12.  That's 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Okay, so Milly has to send a book back. It weighs 4 pounds, costs $32, and needs to go 20 miles.  The shipping company charges a little bit for each pound and each mile.  

First, the shipping costs are $0.35 per pound, so that's 4 pounds times $0.35, which is $1.40. Then, it costs $0.08 per mile, and that's 20 miles times $0.08, which is $1.60.  

So, the total cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.  

But, the book is only worth 75% of the price she paid, so she gets $24.00 back. 

Milly loses $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00.

"Mulan has $140. She spent $80 on jeans and a bag.  She has $60 left. 

**Answer:** $60 
"
"Okay, so Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars a month.  He makes 8,000 in the first week.  The second week he makes half as much, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000.  Then in the third week he makes three times as much as the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000.  That's a lot of chocolate!  So far he's made 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  To find out how much he makes in the fourth week, we take his total for the first three weeks and subtract that from his total for the month: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.  So, he makes 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

* **Videos:** 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
* **Songs:** 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
* **Makeup:** 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes
* **Total time:** 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes
* **Monthly time:** 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes

**So, Brittany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month!**

"Okay, so Angela wants to get her stuff hung.  She has a lot of mirrors, and she has some chandeliers too.  She also has a lot of pictures.  How much will it cost to hang everything?

Here's what we know:

* **Mirrors:** She has 6 mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** She has 2 chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** She has 20 pictures.
* **Installation cost:** The company charges $15.00 for each mirror, chandelier, and picture.

Let's add up the cost:

* **Mirrors:** 6 mirrors * $15.00/mirror = $90.00
* **Chandeliers:** 2 chandeliers * $15.00/chandelier = $30.00
* **Pictures:** 20 pictures * $15.00/picture = $300.00

Now, let's add all the costs together: $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $420.00

So, it will cost Angela $420.00 to hang everything!

"Roy saved 40% more than Anthony. Anthony saved $10 more than Eva. Eva saved $20.  So, how much did Roy save? 

Here's how to figure it out:

* Anthony saved $30.00 (Eva saved $20.00 + $10.00)
* Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, so he saved 1.4 times Anthony's amount.
* 1.4 times $30.00 is $42.00. 

**Answer:** Roy saved $42.00.

"Okay, so we know Pompei can lift 1 inch.  Then Saskay can lift 12 times that, which is 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift 4 times that, which is 48 inches.  And Naruto can lift 10 times that, which is 480 inches.  To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to convert that to feet.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 480 inches is equal to 480 / 12 = 40 feet. 

**Answer:** 40 feet

"Mason rides his bike for 4 hours at 8 miles per hour. That's 4 * 8 = 32 miles.  Then he takes a break, and after that, he rides for another 6 hours at 8 miles per hour. That's 6 * 8 = 48 miles.  So, he rode a total of 32 + 48 = 80 miles. 

**Answer:** 80

"If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel, how long would it take 4 turtles to do the same? 

Here's how to think about it:

* **Kangaroos are fast!**  They travel a long distance in 18 hours.
* **Turtles are slower.** They travel half as fast as a kangaroo.
* **Time and distance are related.**  If we know how long it takes the kangaroos, we can figure out how long it takes the turtles.

**So, how long would it take the turtles?**

* **A. 9 hours**
* **B. 18 hours**
* **C. 36 hours**
* **D. 72 hours**

"Okay, so we have three glue sticks.  Let's see how much glue is left on each one.

* The first one has 1/6 of glue left.
* The second one has 2/3 of glue left.
* The third one has 1/2 of glue left.

To find out how much glue is left in total, we need to add up how much glue is left on each one.

* 1/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 = 4/3

So, we have 4/3 of glue left.

Now, we need to find out how much glue is left on the glue sticks that are not used.  We can do this by subtracting the glue that is used from the total length of the glue sticks.

* 1 glue stick's length - (4/3) = 12 mm - (4/3) mm

To make this easier, let's think about it like this: 12 mm is like a whole bunch of glue sticks.  We need to take away 4/3 of the glue sticks to find out how much glue is left.

* 12 mm - (4/3) mm = (12 * 3) mm - (4 * 1) mm = 36 mm - 4 mm = 32 mm

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 32 millimeters.

"Okay, let's solve this!

* Jack has 60 dishes.
* He has twice as many dishes as socks, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
* Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
* Together, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks.
* Jack has 60 dishes, and Peter has 60 socks, so they have a total of 60 + 60 = 120 dishes.
* So, they have a total of 90 + 120 = 210 socks and dishes.

"Okay, so we have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half of the white shirts have collars, so that's 20.  We also know 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.  To find out how many floral shirts don't have buttons, we take the number of floral shirts and subtract the number with buttons: 50 - 20 = 30.  Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars.  That's 30 - 20 = 10.

"Let's break this down!

* **We know you're three years younger than your brother.**  That means your brother is three years older than you.
* **You're two years older than your sister.** So, your sister is two years younger than you.
* **Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age.**  

Let's use some numbers to help us:

* **You are x years old.**
* **Your brother is x + 3 years old.**
* **Your sister is x - 2 years old.**
* **Your mom is 3(x + 3) - 1 years old.**

"Okay, so we know 40 customers gave Rafaela $20 each. That's a lot of money! Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, so she got 90% of what Rafaela got.  

To find out how much Julieta got, we need to multiply 90% of Rafaela's money.  That's $20 * 0.90 = $18. 

Now, we need to add up Rafaela's money and Julieta's money to find the total.  So, Rafaela got $800 and Julieta got $18.  

The total is $800 + $18 = $818.

"Okay, here's how we can figure this out:

* **Claire gets one badge a month.**
* **Amber takes twice as long as Claire, so she gets half a badge a month.**
* **Wendy gets three times as many badges as Claire, so she gets three badges a month.**

To find out how many more badges Wendy gets than Amber, we need to see how many more badges Wendy gets in a year.

* **Wendy gets 3 badges a month, and there are 12 months in a year.**
* **So, Wendy gets 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.**
* **Amber gets 0.5 badges a month, and there are 12 months in a year.**
* **So, Amber gets 0.5 * 12 = 6 badges in a year.**
* **Wendy gets 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber.**

"Okay, so we know there are 12 red cars.  They have 2 fewer green cars, so there are 10 green cars.  And they have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so there are 30 blue cars.  That's a total of 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars.  To find out how many yellow cars there are, we need to subtract the red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars: 75 - 52 = 23.  So there are 23 yellow cars!

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books.
* Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
* Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

To find out how many books Fawn has, let's use some clues:

**Think about it like this:**

*  Let's say Fawn has 'F' books.
*  Anne has 'F - 12' books.
*  Sofie has 'F - 12 + 25' books.

Now, let's put it all together:

F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

**Let's solve the equation:**

* 3F + 13 = 85
* 3F = 72
* F = 24

**So, Fawn has 24 books!**

"Isaias wants to make $2000 from selling his chickens. He has 300 chickens and wants to sell 3/5 of them.  To figure out how much he spent on the chickens, we need to do a few things. 

First, we need to figure out how many chickens he's selling.  He's selling 3/5 of his chickens, which is 3/5 * 300 chickens = 180 chickens.

Now, he's going to sell each chicken for $50.  So, he'll make $50 * 180 chickens = $9000 from selling them.

To make $2000 profit, he needs to make $9000 - $2000 = $7000.  

So, he spent $7000 on the chickens.

"Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The boys sold the same amount, so they sold 14 glasses each.  To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we need to subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number of glasses Julie sold. 

Julie sold 14 - 14 = 0 more glasses than Micah.

"Okay, so Iris went to the spa. She spent $400 on her hair.  To get her nails done, she spent 1/4 of that amount, which is $400 / 4 = $100. Then, for her pedicure, she spent 3/4 of the manicure price, which is $100 * 3/4 = $75.  So, in total, she spent $400 + $100 + $75 = $575 at the spa. 

**Answer:** $575

"If Melanie is 8 years old now, in 10 years she will be 18.  To find out how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age, we need to figure out how many years it will take for her to be 24 years old. 

Here's how:

* Melanie will be 24 years old in 10 years + 10 years = 20 years. 
* So the answer is 20 years.

"Kelly has a lot of things in her cart!  Let's see how much money she has left.

* Bacon: 5 packs cost $10.
* Chicken: Each chicken pack costs twice as much as bacon, so that's $10 * 2 = $20 for 6 packs.
* Strawberries: 3 packs cost $4 each, so that's $4 * 3 = $12.
* Apples: 7 packs cost $2 each, so that's $2 * 7 = $14.

Now let's add up all the costs: $10 + $20 + $12 + $14 = $56.

Kelly has $65 to spend, and she spent $56.  She has $65 - $56 = $9 left!

"Elaina's final concert was really long! It was twice as long as her usual concerts.  That means her usual concerts are shorter.  To find out how long they are, we need to figure out how many minutes her final concert was. 

We know her final concert was 65 minutes long, and she added a 15-minute encore.  So, we need to figure out how long her usual concerts are. 

Let's think about it like this:

* Elaina's final concert was 65 minutes long.
* She added 15 minutes for the encore.
* That means her usual concerts are 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes long.

**Answer:** 50 minutes

"Argo has 110 toys left. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* He starts with 200 toys.
* He gives away 40 to Alyssa. 200 - 40 = 160
* He gives away 80 to Bonnie. 160 - 80 = 80
* He gives away 30 to Nicky. 80 - 30 = 50
* So, he has 50 toys left.

"Okay, so we have 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden.  

*  One-fourth of them are indoor plants. That's 100 plants / 4 = 25 indoor plants.
*  The rest of the plants are outside. That's 100 plants - 25 plants = 75 plants.
*  Two-thirds of the plants that are left are outside. That's 75 plants * (2/3) = 50 plants.
*  The rest of the plants are flowering plants. That's 75 plants - 50 plants = 25 plants.
*  So, 25 plants are flowering plants. 
*  That means 25 / 100 = 0.25, which is 25%. 

**Answer:** 25%

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Cake:** They bought a cake for $11.00.
* **Balloons:** They bought 1 dozen balloons, which cost $0.50 for 2 balloons. So, a dozen costs $0.50 * 60 = $30.00.
* **Ice Cream:** They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, which cost $7.00 each, so that's $7.00 * 2 = $14.00.
* **Total Cost:**  The total cost of everything was $11.00 + $30.00 + $14.00 = $55.00.
* **Sharing the Money:** They had $55.00 and they wanted to split it equally, so each girl got $55.00 / 2 = $27.50.

"Andrew baked a lot of pastries! He made 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.  

* Cinnamon rolls have 600 calories each, and mini ones have 200 calories.
* Blueberry muffins have 450 calories each, and mini ones have 150 calories.

* Cinnamon rolls: 200 mini rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
* Blueberry muffins: 300 mini muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories

So, in total, he baked 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories!

"Okay, so Rita picks Junebugs every day.  She picked 39 on Monday, and then twice as many on Tuesday and Wednesday, so that's 39 * 2 = 78.  Then on Thursday she picked 48 and on Friday she picked 57.  That's a total of 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 192 Junebugs.  To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 192 / 5 = 38.4.  So the answer is 38.4.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the three people's ages add up to 100.
* Paul is 10 years older than John.
* Peter's age is the same as Paul and John's combined age.

Let's use some simple math:

*  Let's say John is 'J' years old.
*  Paul is 'J + 10' years old.
*  Peter is 'J + 10 + J' years old, which is '2J + 10' years old.

Now we can write an equation:

*  J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Let's solve for J:

*  4J + 20 = 100
*  4J = 80
*  J = 20

Now we know John is 20 years old.

*  Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.
*  Peter is 20 + 10 + 30 = 60 years old.

**Answer:** Peter is 60 years old.

"Maria had 4 friends, and each friend got 2 water balloons. That's 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons. Then, Maria's mom gave each friend 3 more balloons. That's 3 balloons/friend * 4 friends = 12 balloons.  In total, they have 8 balloons + 12 balloons = 20 balloons. 

**Answer:** 20

"They have 50 boxes of stuff to sell.  They have 15 tables already.  They can put 2 boxes on each table.  So they need 50 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 25 tables.  They already have 15 tables, so they need 25 tables - 15 tables = 10 more tables. 

**Answer:** 10

"Okay, so Zoey has 40 seeds and she throws each one 10 feet. Sydney has 35 seeds and she throws each one 12 feet.  To find out who throws the seeds the furthest, we need to add up how far Zoey throws and how far Sydney throws. 

Zoey throws 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet. 
Sydney throws 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

That means together they throw 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

To find the average, we divide the total distance by how many people are throwing. So, 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet. 

So the answer is 410 feet.

"Fern needs to think about which machine is better for making widgets.  The Widgeteer makes 60 widgets per hour, and the WidgetMaster makes 45.  If she works 24 hours a day for 30 days, which machine will make more money?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Widgeteer:** 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = $7200
* **WidgetMaster:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = $32400

The WidgetMaster makes more money. 

**So the answer is:** WidgetMaster

"Okay, so we have 15 goats and 12 sheep.  

* Goats need 5 pounds of hay each.
* Sheep need 3 pounds less than twice the amount goats need.  

To find out how much hay the sheep need, we do this:

* Twice the amount a goat needs is 5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds
* 3 pounds less than twice the goat's need is 10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

So, the sheep need 7 pounds of hay each.

Now, we need to find the total hay for all the sheep:

* 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds

Finally, we need to add the hay for the goats:

* 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds

So, the total hay is 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds.

"James got 10 CDs, and they cost $15 each.  He got a discount, so they cost less.  He sold 5 of the CDs, and he made $40 for each of the CDs he kept.  How much money did James lose?

a) $50
b) $100
c) $200
d) $150 


 
The answer is **a) $50**. 
"
"Jen has a lot of root crops to sell! 

* She has 6 yams that cost $1.50 each, so she can sell them for $1.50 * 6 = $9.00
* She has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2.00 each, so she can sell them for $2.00 * 10 = $20.00
* She has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each, so she can sell them for $1.25 * 4 = $5.00

So, in total, she can earn $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00 

**Answer:** $34.00 
"
"Okay, so James wants to swim across a lake that's 20 miles long. He can swim 2 miles per hour. He swims for 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles. 

To figure out how long it takes him to swim, we need to know how long it takes him to swim 12 miles.  He swims at 2 miles per hour, so it takes him 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours.

After swimming, he takes a break for 3 hours.  

Now he has to swim the rest of the way, which is 8 miles.  He swims at half the speed, so he takes 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours.

Finally, he takes 8 hours to swim the rest of the way. 

So, in total, it takes James 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours to swim across the lake.

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* We know Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo.
* We also know Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar.

Let's use some numbers to help us:

* Let's say Dinar scored D points.
* Azibo scored A points.
* Bahati scored B points.

We know that together they scored 45 points. So:

* D + A + B = 45

We can use the clues to figure out what each person scored:

* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, so B = A + 20
* Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar, so B = D + 10

Now we can use these clues to find out what A is. 

Let's try to solve for A:

* We know B = A + 20 and B = D + 10. 
* So, A + 20 = D + 10
* We can solve for A by subtracting 10 from both sides: A = D + 10

Now we can use the total points equation:

* D + A + B = 45
* D + (D + 10) + (D + 20) = 45

Let's simplify and solve for D:

* 3D + 30 = 45
* 3D = 15
* D = 5

Now we can find A:

* A = D + 10
* A = 5 + 10
* A = 15

So, Azibo scored 15 points.

"Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups.  If he has two dozen cups and gives Pedro 6 measuring spoons, how many measuring spoons does Jonathan have left?

a) 10
b) 16
c) 22
d) 26

**Answer: d) 26** 
 
Jonathan has 2 dozen cups, which is 2 * 12 = 24 cups.  He has 2/3 of that amount of measuring spoons, which is 2/3 * 24 = 16 measuring spoons.  He gives Pedro 6 spoons, so he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.

"Okay, so the hospital has 1000 beds and some of them are already filled.  They get 50 new patients every day.  To find out how many beds are empty, we need to figure out how many beds are filled and how many are empty. 

If we know that 1/5 of the beds are already filled, we can find out how many are empty. 

We also need to know how many patients are in the hospital in two weeks. 

Let's see... 

* **Step 1:**  We know 1/5 of the beds are filled, so we have 1000 beds * (1/5) = 200 filled beds.
* **Step 2:**  The hospital gets 50 new patients every day, so in two weeks, they get 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients.
* **Step 3:**  We know that 700 patients are in the hospital, and we know there are 200 filled beds.  So, we can find out how many are empty by subtracting the filled beds from the total number of beds. 
* **Step 4:**  We can find out how many are empty by subtracting the filled beds from the total number of beds.

"Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.  Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. Aliya is 3 years old.  So Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.  Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old. 

**Answer:** 45

"If Kelly is right, Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%.  To find the real number of people, we need to take away 20% of the number Courtney said. 

So, we need to figure out what 20% of 48 is.  

* 20% of 48 is 0.20 * 48 = 9.6 people.

Then, we subtract that number from Courtney's original number: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 people. 

**Answer:** 38 people

"Okay, so we know Jason carried 2 balls.  That means Jeffrey carried 1 ball, and Jordan carried 4 balls.  If they all carried the balls together, they carried a total of 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 balls.  The coach must have brought 7 balls to practice.

"The pirates dug a total of 31 holes before they found the treasure.  They filled in two holes, so they dug 31 - 2 = 29 holes.  Then, they dug 29 * 4 = 116 holes on the fourth day.

"Let's think about this problem!

* **Amora and Lainey get 70 chips each.** That's a total of 70 + 70 = 140 chips.
* **The other two people get some chips too.**  They get 140 - 15 = 125 chips.
* **So, there are 140 + 125 = 265 chips in total.** 


**Answer:** 265

"Okay, so Jen needs $400 for supplies.  The tickets cost 50% more than the supplies.  To find out how much the tickets cost, we need to figure out how much 50% of $400 is.  

* 50% of $400 is (50/100) * $400 = $200. 

The tickets cost $200 more than the supplies, so the tickets cost $400 + $200 = $600. 


**Answer:** $600

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe are catching Pokemon.  They have a total of 339 Pokemon.  

* **Let's think about how many each person has:**
    * Alex has more than Stan.
    * Stan has less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has.

* **Let's use some math to figure out how many Pokemon each person has:**
    * We know Alex has 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
    * We also know Stan has 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has.

* **Let's use a trick to find out how many Pokemon Stan has:**
    * We can use the total number of Pokemon and the information we know about Alex and Stan to find out how many Pokemon Stan has. 

* **Let's solve it!** 
    * We know that Alex has 5 more Pokemon than Stan, and Stan has 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has.

"The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so she travels 30 miles * 10 hours = 300 miles. Then, she flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 18 miles * 2 hours = 36 miles.  Finally, she flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, which is 22 miles * 5 hours = 110 miles.  To find the total distance, we add all the distances: 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles.

"Okay, here's how we can figure this out:

* Emil is 19 now.
* When he's 24, he'll be half his dad's age and twice his brother's age. 

Let's think about that:

* **Dad's age:**  When Emil is 24, his dad will be twice as old as Emil's brother.  So, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
* **Brother's age:** When Emil is 24, he'll be half his dad's age. So, his brother will be 48 / 2 = 24 years old.

Now, to find the sum of their ages, we just add them together: 48 + 24 = 72.

**Answer:** 72

"Okay, so Emily peels shrimp really fast!  She can peel 6 shrimp every minute.  To cook them, it takes her 10 minutes to cook 30 shrimp.  So, to cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 minutes.  Then, she needs 15 minutes to peel all the shrimp.  So, it will take her 15 + 3 = 18 minutes to peel and cook all the shrimp. 

**Answer:** 18 minutes

"Okay, let's think about this!

* The first plane flies to Greece a lot, like three-quarters of the time.
* The rest of the time, it flies to France and Germany.
* The other plane only flies to Poland.

We know the other plane flies to Poland 22 times.  That's half the number of flights the first plane makes. 

So, how many flights does the first plane make? 


**Answer:** 44

"Okay, here's how to figure out how long the wolves howl:

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so she howls for 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.
* **Total time for Tobias and Chikote:** Together, they howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time for all three wolves is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:** There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

So the answer is **2 minutes**.

"Walter's lawyer is going to give $3800. 

Here's how we know:

* Walter got $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund.
* That's a total of $500 + $1500 = $2000.
* His lawyer is going to give three times the amount Walter and his friend got, so he's going to give $2000 * 3 = $6000.
* Walter and his friend got $2000 + $200 = $2200.
* So, his lawyer will give $6000 - $2200 = $3800.

"Okay, so we have 2 adults and 4 kids, and they want to share a watermelon.  

The adults get slices that are twice as big as the kids' slices.  

To figure out how much of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to figure out how big each kid's slice is. 

Let's say each kid gets a slice that's 'x' big.  The adults get twice that size, so they get 2x.

Now, we have 2 adults and 4 kids, so there are 6 slices in total.

To figure out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to figure out how much of the watermelon each adult gets. 

So, each adult gets (2x / 6) * 100% = (x/3) * 100%

"Okay, so Jordan wants to make a cake for her mom.  It will take her a while to make the cake, so she needs to start early! 

Here's how long it will take:

* Making the batter: 20 minutes
* Baking the cake: 30 minutes
* Cooling the cake: 2 hours is 120 minutes
* Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

That's a lot of time!  To make sure she has time to finish, she needs to start at least 120 minutes before she wants to serve the cake. 

So, the latest she can start is 1:00 pm.

"If Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes, they sold a total of 8 boxes.  Each box has a certain number of chocolate bars.  To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes. 

So, 64 chocolate bars / 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box. 


**Answer:** 8

"The dance studio charges $25 to rent the place and $1.50 for each student.  They have 10 students and go to the studio 3 days a week.  So, they go to the studio 3 days * 4 weeks = 12 times a month.  That means they make $25 per day * 12 days = $300.  So, they make $300 a month. 

**Answer:** $300

"Okay, so we know there are 50 porcupines in the park.  Half of them are female, so there are 30 female porcupines.  Each female porcupine has 4 babies a month, so in a year, she'll have 4 babies * 12 months = 48 babies.  That means there will be 48 babies + 30 female porcupines = 78 porcupines in the park after a year. 

**Answer:** 78

"The pool is 14 feet long, 25 feet wide, and 4 feet deep.  To find out how much water they need, we multiply the length, width, and depth. That's 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet.  That's 1400 cubic feet of water.  

To figure out how many gallons that is, we need to know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. So, 1400 cubic feet is equal to 1400 * 7.48 gallons. That's 10,392 gallons.

The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon, so to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool, we multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon. That's 10,392 gallons * $0.10/gallon. That's $1039.20.

"Here's how we can figure this out:

* **Students over 16:** Half of the students are over 16, so there are 3000 students / 2 = 1500 students.
* **Male students over 16:** One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, so there are 1500 students / 4 = 375 male students.
* **Female students under 16:** The rest of the students are under 16, so there are 3000 students - 1500 students = 1500 students.
* **Female students under 16:** Half of the students under 16 are female, so there are 1500 students / 2 = 750 female students.

"Bethany can run 10 laps, Trey can run 14, Shaelyn runs 7, and Quinn runs 5.  To find out how many more laps Bethany can run than Quinn, we need to subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps. Bethany runs 10 laps and Quinn runs 5 laps, so Bethany runs 10 - 5 = 5 more laps than Quinn. 

**Answer:** 5

"Okay, so the tank is 18,000 gallons big. Wanda and Ms. B work together to fill it. 

On the first day, Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is like 1/4 * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons. Then Ms. B helps by filling 3/4 of what Wanda filled, which is 3/4 * 4,500 = 3,375 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda fills 2/3 of what she did the first day, which is 2/3 * 4,500 = 3,000 gallons. Ms. B fills 1/3 of what she did the first day, which is 1/3 * 3,375 = 1,125 gallons.

So, together they filled 4,500 + 3,375 + 3,000 + 1,125 = 12,000 gallons. 

Now, we need to find out how much is left. The tank is 18,000 gallons, and they filled 12,000, so there are 18,000 - 12,000 = 6,000 gallons left.

"Okay, so the power bank was at 100% when Maria started.  Then it lost some charge.  It lost 45% of its charge in the first 5 hours.  After that, it lost 21% of its charge in the next 3 hours.  

To find out how much it was at the start, we need to figure out how much charge it had after the first 5 hours.  

The power bank had 55% of its charge left after 5 hours.  Then it lost 21% of its charge in the next 3 hours.  

So, how much charge did it have after 8 hours?

"Okay, so Janet works 40 hours a week.  She makes $10 an hour from her job and gets $15 from tips.  She wants to save for a car that costs $10,000.  

To figure out how long she needs to work, we need to know how much she saves each week.  She saves $5 each week.

To find out how many weeks it will take to save $10,000, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save by how much she saves each week.

"Here's how to figure this out:

* **Maybe no homework:** There's a 50% chance the teacher won't collect it.
* **Maybe an extension:** Even if the teacher is there, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extra day.
* **Maybe Marcus gets an extension:** Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can say his dog ate his homework.

So, to find out if Marcus has to do his homework, we need to think about all the different ways it could happen. 

**The answer is 8%.**

"Okay, so the school has 6000 seats for the graduation.  But they need to make sure there's enough for the graduates and the teachers.  They have 950 seats for the graduates and 300 for the teachers.  So, how many seats are left? 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats.  If they want to give each graduate a ticket, how many tickets do they need to give? 4750 seats / 1000 graduates = 4.75 tickets per graduate. 


**Answer:** 4.75

"Grandpa eats a lot of jelly beans!  He eats 75 big ones to be full.  He eats twice as many medium ones as big ones.  If 3 small beans are like 1 medium bean, how many small beans can he eat?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Medium beans:** Grandpa eats twice as many medium beans as big beans, so he eats 75 * 2 = 150 medium beans.
* **Small beans:**  Since 3 small beans are like 1 medium bean, he can eat 150 / 3 = 50 small beans.

**Answer:** 50

"Okay, so Melissa works for 3 days and spends 6 hours each day.  She gets paid $15 each day, but has to pay $3 for parking.  

To find out how much she makes per hour after paying for parking, we need to figure out how much she makes each day after paying for parking.  She makes $15 - $3 = $12 each day.

Now, she works for 3 days, so she works for 3 * 6 = 18 hours.

So, she makes $12 / 18 = $0.67 per hour after paying for parking.

"Okay, so Jim goes to college for four years. He gets $50,000 a year in loans.  He used to make $25,000 a year before college.  His degree makes him three times as much money now.  So, how long will it take him to make enough money to pay off his loans and the money he would have made if he was working?

**Here's how to figure that out:**

* **How much money does he make now?**  He makes $75,000 a year now.
* **How much money does he lose by going to college?** He loses $25,000 a year.
* **How much money does he need to make?** He needs to make $200,000 to pay off his loans.
* **How long will it take him to make that much money?**  He needs to make $300,000.

"Jim needs fabric for his big bed!  He needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.  The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.  To find out how much fabric he needs, we need to figure out how big the fabric pieces are.  The fabric pieces are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider, so they are 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.  Now we need to find the area of the bed and the area of each piece of fabric.  The bed is 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  Each piece of fabric is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.  So, he needs 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet of fabric. 

**Answer:** 160

"Okay, so the post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.  On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of that amount.  That means they delivered 17 more than 425 / 5 = 85 letters.  So they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount they delivered on Tuesday.  Twice the amount on Tuesday was 102 * 2 = 204 letters.  Then they delivered 5 more than that, so they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.

Finally, they delivered 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters in total.

"Okay, so we have three people sharing $1920.  The second person got $80 more than the first person.  The third person got twice what the second person got.  

To figure out how much the first person got, we need to think about how much each person got in total. 

Let's say the first person got 'x' dollars. The second person got 'x + $80' dollars. The third person got '2(x + $80)' dollars.

Now, we can write an equation to figure out what 'x' is:

(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

Let's solve for 'x' to find out how much the first person got.

"Okay, so they worked for 3/8 of a day each day for 3 weeks.  That's a lot of painting!  Let's figure out how many hours they worked.

* **Days of work:** 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days
* **Hours of work:** 3/8 of a day * 21 days = 63/8 days
* **Hours per painter:** 63/8 days * 24 hours/day = 189 hours

**So, each painter worked 189 hours!**

Now let's think about the first set.  He got 4 more balls than the second set, so he got 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

**Answer:** Rory got 10 tennis balls in the first set.

"The car is getting cheaper every year!  

Here's how we can figure out how much it's worth in 2010:

* **Year 1 (2008):**  The car loses 21% of its value, which is like taking away a part of it.  We take 21% of $20,000, which is like taking away 21 out of every 100 dollars. That's $20,000 * 0.21 = $4,200.  So the car is now worth $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800.
* **Year 2 (2009):**  We do the same thing again, taking 21% of the car's value from the year before.  That's $15,800 * 0.21 = $3,318.  The car is now worth $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482.
* **Year 3 (2010):**  We take 21% of the car's value from the year before. That's $12,482 * 0.21 = $2,607. The car is now worth $12,482 - $2,607 = $9,875.


**So the answer is $9,875!**

"Okay, so you want to tile your kitchen floor!  

To figure out how much it will cost, we need to know how many tiles you need.  

* **Step 1:**  Your kitchen floor is 200 square feet.
* **Step 2:** Each tile is 1 foot by 1 foot.
* **Step 3:**  To find out how many tiles you need, we divide the total area by the size of each tile. 200 square feet / 1 square foot per tile = 200 tiles.
* **Step 4:**  Each tile costs $12. So, you'll need to buy 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

That's a lot of tiles!

* **Big coupons:** He sends twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he sends 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.
* **Cost of small coupons:** Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so he spends 700 * 0.05 = 35 cents on small coupons.
* **Cost of big coupons:** Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so he spends 1400 * 0.15 = 210 cents on big coupons.
* **Total postage:** He spends 35 cents + 210 cents = 245 cents in total.

"Okay, so Kayla's party is at a movie theater.  It costs $125 to rent the whole place for 20 people.  Then, for each extra person, it costs $6. Kayla has 25 classmates and 7 friends from her dance class, plus 13 family members.  Only 4 people can't come.  How much will the party cost?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **How many people are coming to the party?**  Kayla has 25 classmates + 7 friends + 13 family members = 45 people.
* **How many people are coming besides Kayla?**  There are 45 people - 4 people who can't come = 41 people coming to the party.
* **How much does it cost for all the extra people?**  It costs $6 per person, so 41 people * $6/person = $246.
* **How much does the whole party cost?**  The theater costs $125 to rent, plus $246 for the extra people = $371.

**So the answer is $371.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* The first train comes first, and it stays for 20 minutes.
* The second train comes after the first one, and it stays for 10 minutes.

"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  To figure out how much is left for Sam, we need to figure out how much Sam has. 

Let's think about it like this:

* Sam has 'x' feet of fence.
* Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.

If we add up their fences, we get 100 feet: x + (x + 60) = 100

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

So, Sam has 20 feet of fence.

To find out how much is left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total fence: 100 - 80 = 20 feet.


**Answer: 20**

"Okay, so Tony has four walls to paint.  The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, and the east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet.  To figure out how much paint he needs, we need to add up the area of all the walls.  

* North and South: 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet
* East and West: 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet
* Total area: 80 square feet + 40 square feet = 120 square feet

Now, we know that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. So, Tony needs 120 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 6 gallons of paint.

Finally, a gallon of paint costs $12. So, 6 gallons * $12/gallon = $72. 

That means it will cost Tony $72 to paint the room.

* **The frying pan was on sale for $20.00, and she got 20% off**

"Okay, so Lauren wants to save for 20 years for retirement.  She saves 20% of her money each paycheck.  She also wants to live on 40% of her salary.  

To figure out how long she needs to work, we need to know how much she saves each year.  

* She saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, which is like taking 20 out of every 100.  That's $20,000 a year.
* She wants to spend 40% of her salary on living, which is like taking 40 out of every 100. That's $40,000 a year.
* She saves $20,000 and spends $40,000, leaving her with $60,000 a year.

To figure out how much she needs to save, we need to know how much she needs to save in total.  She wants to save for 20 years.  

So, she needs to save $60,000 a year for 20 years.  That's $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000. 

So, she needs to work for 1,200,000 / 60,000 = 20 years.

"If the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, how long will it take to blink 459 times?

**Here's how to figure that out:**

* We know the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.
* To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we need to figure out how many minutes it takes to blink that many times.

**Let's think about it:**

* If the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, that means it blinks 51 times in one minute (255 / 5 = 51).
* So, to blink 459 times, we need to divide 459 by 51. 
* 459 / 51 = 9 minutes.

**Answer:** It will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.**  That means they each painted the same amount. Let's call that amount ""x"".
* **Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together.**  That means Sarah painted ""y"" eggs.  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.
* **To find out how many eggs Camden painted, we need to figure out how many Sarah painted.** We know that Sarah painted ""y"" eggs. We also know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So, we can write that equation: y + 12 = 2y + 12.
* **Now we can solve for y!**  We can subtract ""y"" from both sides of the equation to get 12 = y.
* **We know that Arnold and Madeline painted ""x"" eggs each, and we know that they painted the same amount.** So, we can write that equation: x + x = 2x.

"Let's count the blue birds!

* Three trees have 7 blue birds each, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 blue birds.
* Two trees have 4 blue birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 blue birds.

"Melanie's dad gets more cows and chickens every day for three weeks.  Let's see how many animals he has at the end!

* **Cows:** He starts with 50 cows. He gets 20 more cows each day for 21 days. That's 20 cows * 21 days = 420 cows.  So, he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows.
* **Chickens:** He starts with 20 chickens. He gets 10 more chickens each day for 21 days. That's 10 chickens * 21 days = 210 chickens. So, he has 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.
* **Total:** He has 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals. 

**Answer:** 700

"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels.  Each pack has 9 bagels, so that's 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.  He gets a 10% discount, so he pays $36.00 for the bagels.  That means each bagel costs $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00.

"Okay, so Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, that's 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, so that's 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  To figure out how many dozens he needs for 60 days, we need to divide the total eggs by how many eggs are in a dozen.  240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens. 

**Answer:** 20

"There are 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans, so there are 34 red jelly beans.  That's a total of 17 + 34 = 51 jelly beans.  The rest are blue jelly beans, so there are 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans. 

**Answer:** 9

"It will take Lauren 22 days to finish all the pictures. 

Here's how:

* She draws 9 days for the big pictures.
* She draws 6 days for the medium pictures.
* She draws 7 days for the small pictures. 
 
Let's add those up! 9 + 6 + 7 = 22

"
"Jen has 3 fish, and each fish needs $1 of food a day.  So, she spends $3 a day on food.  In May, she has 30 days.  That means she spends $90 on food in May. 

**Answer:** $90

"
"Okay, so Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he went another 140 miles in 3 hours.  To find his average speed, we need to know how fast he was going overall.

* **First, let's figure out how fast he was going the first time:**  He traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, so he was going 110 miles / 2 hours = 55 miles per hour.

* **Then, he traveled another 140 miles in 3 hours:**  That means he was going 140 miles / 3 hours = 46.67 miles per hour (that's a little over 46 miles per hour).

* **To find his average speed, we need to add up all the miles he traveled and the time he took:** He traveled 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles. He took 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

* **Now, we can find his average speed:** 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour. 


**Answer:** 50 miles per hour 
"
"Okay, so we have two lottery tickets.  The first one has a 20% chance of winning. The second one is three times more likely to win, so it's 60%.  To find the chance of both winning, we multiply the chances of each ticket winning.  That means we multiply 20% by 60%.  That's 12%.  So the answer is 12%. 


 
"
"Okay, so we know Jim had 27 seashells, and that's 5 more than Carlos.  Carlos had twice as many as Carrey.  So, let's figure out how many each person had. 

* **Carlos:**  Carlos had 22 seashells.
* **Carrey:** Carrey had 11 seashells.
* **Total:** Together they had 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.
* **Sharing:**  They split the seashells equally, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells. 


**Answer:** 20 
"
"Mason eats carrots every day. On weekdays he eats 4 carrots, and on the weekend he eats 5 carrots each day.  So, he eats 4 carrots a day for 5 days, and 5 carrots a day for 2 days.  That's a total of 4 * 5 + 5 * 2 = 20 + 10 = 30 carrots. 

**Answer:** 30 
"
"The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer, which is like adding 60% of 5 minutes.  That's like adding 5 minutes * 0.60 = 3 minutes.  So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.  The total time is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes. 

**Answer:** 13 minutes 
"
"Linus sold the phones for twice the price he bought them for.  He sold 2 phones on Monday and 4 phones on Tuesday.  He made $80 from the phones he sold on Monday and $160 from the phones he sold on Tuesday.  That's a total of $80 + $160 = $240. 

**Answer:** $240 
"

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how many more bottles Hortex needs to make. 

* **Step 1:**  We know each bottle helps 20% of one person's energy needs.
* **Step 2:**  We need to help 2300 people, so we need to find out how much energy they need in total.
* **Step 3:**  We know 2300 people need 2300 * 0.20 = 460 units of energy.
* **Step 4:**  Hortex can make 4200 bottles, but we need 460 more. 

**Answer:** Hortex needs to make 460 more bottles. 
"
"Okay, so Carla had eight babies.  She dresses some in purple and some in blue.  We know that some of the babies in blue wear bows, and some of the babies in purple wear bows.  

To figure out the chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we need to figure out how many babies are wearing bows and how many of those babies are wearing purple. 

* **Purple babies:** Carla has 6 babies in purple.
* **Blue babies:** Carla has 2 babies in blue.
* **Babies wearing bows:**  We know 2 babies in purple and 2/3 of the blue babies wear bows. 

Let's think about it like this:

* **Purple babies wearing bows:** 2 babies in purple.
* **Blue babies wearing bows:** 2/3 of the blue babies wear bows.

"Let's figure out how many eggs are left hidden!

* Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
* Lamar found 5 eggs.
* Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
* Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
* Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
* Together, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
* So, there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs left hidden!

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* A 5-year-old avocado tree makes 50 fruits.
* A 6-year-old makes 3 times that, so 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
* A 7-year-old makes 7 times that, so 150 * 7 = 1050 fruits.
* A 8-year-old makes 1050 - 200 = 850 fruits.
* A 10-year-old makes 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.
* But the tree doesn't make any fruit in year 9.

So, the total fruits are: 50 + 150 + 1050 + 850 + 1000 = 3550 fruits.

"Okay, so we know the yellow rope is the longest.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.  If all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long, how long is the red rope?

**Here's how to solve it:**

* Let's say the yellow rope is 'x' centimeters long.
* The blue rope is 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

**Now we can write an equation:**

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Let's solve for x:**

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12

**Now we know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.**

The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope, so it's 4 * (x - 7) = 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

**Answer:** The red rope is 20 centimeters long.

"Ronnie had $5. Rissa had three times that amount, so she had $15.

"Okay, so we know the mural has red, white, purple, and yellow paint.  Half the mural is yellow, so that's 6 pints.  Since the red, white, and purple paint are all the same, they make up the other half of the mural.  So, each of those colors is 6 pints / 3 colors = 2 pints.  The total amount of red paint is 6 pints * 2 pints/color = 12 pints.

"Tom has 4 bedrooms, each 20 feet by 12 feet.  That's 20 feet times 12 feet for each bedroom, which is 240 square feet. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 times 5, which is 1200 square feet.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  So, the total area of the house is 240 times 4 plus 1200 plus 1000, which is 960 plus 1200 plus 1000.  That's 3160 square feet.

"Okay, so team A scored 4 goals in the first half. Team B scored 2 fewer than that, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals. 

In the second half, team B scored 4 times more than they did in the first half, which is 2 * 4 = 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of what team B scored, which is 8 * (1/4) = 2 goals.

So, in total, the teams scored 4 + 2 + 8 + 2 = 16 goals.

"Okay, so the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday.  That's a lot!  He uses 20% each day, so he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.  That means he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk left.  To figure out how many days he can use it, we need to divide the amount of chalk left by the amount he uses each day.  He can use the chalk for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days. 


**Answer:** 2.2 days

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

* **Wendy is older:**  We know Wendy is five times older than Colin will be in seven years. 
* **Colin's future:** In 25 years, Colin will be a third of Wendy's age now.

Let's use some simple math to figure out Colin's age now. 

**Think about it like this:**

* **Colin's age now:**  Let's call Colin's age ""C"".
* **Wendy's age now:** Let's call Wendy's age ""W"".

**Here's what we know:**

* **Wendy's age in seven years:** W = 5(C + 7) 
* **Colin's age in 25 years:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Now we can solve for C (Colin's age now):**

We need to figure out what number makes the second equation true. 

**Let's try to make the second equation easier to understand:**

* **Colin's age in 25 years:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)
* **We know W = 5(C + 7):**  Let's substitute this into the equation. 
* **C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)**

Now we can solve for C!

"Jason earned $8.00. 

Here's how we figure that out:

* He gets $3.00 for doing laundry.
* He gets $1.50 for cleaning his room.
* He gets $0.75 for taking the trash out.
* He gets $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.

Let's count how many times he did each thing:

* Laundry: 1 time
* Trash: 2 times
* Cleaning: 1 time
* Dishwasher: 6 times

Now let's add up how much he earned for each thing:

* Laundry: $3.00
* Trash: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50
* Cleaning: $1.50
* Dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

So, Jason earned $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 + $3.00 = $8.00!

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!

We know that eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40.  

* Let's say the number of coffee mugs is represented by a ""secret number"" which we can call ""x"".

* Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4 * x.

* Eight more than four times the number is 4 * x + 8.

* We know this is equal to 40. So, we can write the equation: 4 * x + 8 = 40

Now, let's solve for ""x"" to find the number of coffee mugs!

* Subtract 8 from both sides: 4 * x = 32
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 8

So, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge!

"Okay, so the jar is big, like 6 inches by 6 inches, and it's 15 inches tall.  That's a lot of space!  

To figure out how many jelly beans are in there, we need to know how much space each jelly bean takes up.  It's like a tiny little box!  It's 0.15 cubic inches.

Now, we know that the jar is full of jelly beans, and we know that 80% of the space is used.  That means we need to figure out how many jelly beans fit in the jar.

We also know that 30% of the jelly beans are red.  So, we need to figure out how many red jelly beans there are.

Finally, we know there are 900 red jelly beans in the jar.  

To figure out how far off Tim's guess was, we need to find the difference between the number of red jelly beans he thought were in the jar and the real number.

"Okay, so the bus started with 20 people. Then, 40 more people got on.  Then, 3/4 of the people who got on the bus at the first stop got on the bus again.  So, that's 40 * (3/4) = 30 people.  So, there are 60 people on the bus now.  Then, the bus doubled the number of people on it.  So, there are 60 * 2 = 120 people on the bus.  The bus has 120 people, and it can hold 200 people.  So, there are 200 - 120 = 80 people left to fill up the bus.

"Okay, so we have 40 students in total.  They want to do an escape room with 8 people in each group.  So, how many groups can they make? 

* 40 students / 8 students per group = 5 groups

They need 45 minutes to do the escape room, and each group does it for 45 minutes.  So, how long will it take all of them?

* 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes 


**Answer:** 225 minutes

"Okay, so Ian has a board that's 40 feet long. He wants to cut it into two pieces.  The longer piece is four times longer than the shorter piece.  

To find out how long the longer piece is, let's think about it like this:

*  Let's say the shorter piece is like a little box, and the longer piece is like a bigger box.
*  The longer box is four times bigger than the little box. 
*  We know the total length of the board is 40 feet. 

To find out how long the little box is, we can do this:

*  If the longer box is four times bigger than the little box, we can think of it like this: 4 * the little box = the longer box.
*  We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can write that as: little box + longer box = 40 feet. 

Let's solve for the little box:

*  We know the longer box is 4 times the little box, so we can write that as: 4 * little box = 40 feet.
*  We can divide both sides by 4 to find the length of the little box: little box = 10 feet. 

The longer piece is four times the length of the little box, so it's 4 * 10 feet = 40 feet.

"Okay, so Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class.  She makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes she makes brownies.  

Let's think about this:

* **Cupcakes:** We'll call the number of cupcakes ""c"".
* **Brownies:** We'll call the number of brownies ""b"".

We know that b is 3 times the number of cupcakes, minus 2.  That means:

* b = 3c - 2

We also know that everyone in the class gets 2 treats.  So, 5 people get 2 treats each, which means the total number of treats is 10.

To find out how many cupcakes Carly made, we need to figure out what ""c"" is.  We can do that by using the information we have.

Let's think about it like this:

* **Cupcakes + Brownies = 10** 

We know that b = 3c - 2, so we can substitute that into the equation:

* **c + (3c - 2) = 10**

Now, let's solve for ""c"":

* **4c - 2 = 10**

"To find the mean, we need to add all the scores together.  Then, we divide that total by how many scores there are.

Here's how:

* 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 570
* 570 / 9 = 63.33

So the mean score is 63.33.

"Eve had 20 pomelos. She gave some away, and now she has 5 left.  To find out how many she gave away, we need to find the difference between the number she had and the number she has left.  So, she gave away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.

"Skyler has 100 hats. Half of them are red, so that's 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.  He has 50 hats left.  Then, 3/5 of the rest are blue, which is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.  That leaves 50 - 30 = 20 hats that are white. 

So the answer is 20.

"Okay, so Archie gets beef jerky in a bag with 30 sticks.  If the bag costs $18.00, and it's on sale for $3.00 less, how much does each stick cost? 

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* The sale price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00
*  That means each stick costs $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick
*  That's like saying $0.50 for 100 cents! 

**So the answer is 50 cents.**

"Okay, so Mary makes strawberry ice cubes and blueberry ice cubes.  She makes 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4 blueberry cubes.  She makes a total of 116 ice cubes.  How many blueberry cubes does she make?

**Here's how to solve it:**

* Let's say Mary makes 'x' strawberry cubes.
* She makes 5 times that number minus 4 blueberry cubes, which is 5x - 4.
* The total number of ice cubes is x + (5x - 4) = 116.

**Let's find out how many strawberry cubes she makes:**

* 6x - 4 = 116
* 6x = 120
* x = 20

**Now we know she made 20 strawberry cubes!**

* To find the number of blueberry cubes, we use the equation: 5x - 4
* 5 * 20 - 4 = 96

**Answer: 96**

"It will take 30 minutes longer to dry all the paintings. 

Here's why:

*  The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry one painting.
*  If we have 6 paintings, it will take 12 minutes * 6 = 72 minutes to dry all of them.
*  The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry one painting, so it would take 7 minutes * 6 = 42 minutes to dry all the paintings.
*  The difference is 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

"Okay, so Conor goes to the beach every day.  On the first day, there were 50 people.  The next day, there were 20 more people, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.  On the third day, there were twice as many people as the second day, so there were 70 * 2 = 140 people.  So far, Conor saw 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.  Then, he saw 60 people each day for the rest of the week, so he saw 60 * 5 = 300 people.  In total, Conor saw 260 + 300 = 560 people at the beach that week. 

**Answer:** 560

The last 30 seconds are slower, but he still gets a bunch of popcorn!  After the popcorn is done, some of it pops even more from the heat.  How many kernels does Garrett have to eat?

a) 20
b) 60
c) 240
d) 440 
 
The answer is **d) 440**

"They have 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.  German Shepherds eat 5 kilograms of food each, and Bulldogs eat 3 kilograms each.  To find out how much food they need in a week, we need to add up how much each dog eats each day.  That's 5 + 3 = 8 kilograms of food a day.  So, in a week, they need 8 * 7 = 56 kilograms of food. 

**Answer:** 56 
"
"Okay, so we have 10 animals with 2 legs each and 15 animals with 4 legs each.  

Let's add up the legs: 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs, and 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs.

That's a total of 20 + 60 = 80 legs! 


**Answer:** 80

"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours and then east for 8 hours.  That's a long drive!  

To figure out how far he is from his house, we need to think about how far he traveled in total.  

* He drove west for 5 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's 5 * 18 = 90 miles.
* Then he drove east for 8 hours at 18 miles per hour. That's 8 * 18 = 144 miles.
*  In total, he drove 90 + 144 = 234 miles.

So, Elvis is 234 miles from his house.

"Okay, so Gary bought a boat for $9000.  The first year it lost 30% of its value.  That means it's worth $9000 - $9000 * 0.30 = $6300.  Then, the second year it lost another 30% of its value, so it's worth $6300 - $6300 * 0.30 = $4410.  Finally, the third year it lost 20% of its value, so it's worth $4410 - $4410 * 0.20 = $3528. 

So the boat is worth $3528 after three years.

"Okay, so we know there are 232 candies in the bag.  We also know there are 54 red candies.  Twice that many orange candies is 54 * 2 = 108.  And half as many yellow candies as red candies is 54 / 2 = 27.  So, we have 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  To find out how many are pink, we take the total number of candies and subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies: 232 - 189 = 43.  So the answer is 43.

"John's car is heavy! It weighs 1200 pounds, and that's even heavier with his luggage, which weighs 250 pounds.  Then there are his two kids, who weigh 75 pounds each, so that's 150 pounds more!  To move the car, John needs to push with a force that's 1% of how heavy the car is.  So, he needs to push with 1% of 1600 pounds.  That's 16 pounds!

"James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.  

**Here's why:**

* A fence is like a rectangle, which means it has two long sides and two short sides.
* To find the total length of the fence, we need to add up the lengths of all the sides. 
* The long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet.
* We need to add them together: 20 feet + 15 feet = 35 feet.
* We need to double that number because we need to go around the whole fence. 
* 35 feet * 2 = 70 feet.

"Ryan has $18 from doing his chores. He spent $3.75 on ice cream for himself and his friends.  That leaves him with $18 - $3.75 = $14.25.  If the movie tickets cost $6.50 each, he can buy $14.25 / $6.50 = 2.2 tickets.  Since you can't buy a fraction of a ticket, Ryan can buy **2** movie tickets.

"The answer is 1000. 

Here's why:

* Norman High School has 4000 students.
* Butler High School has 3/4 of that, which is like 3/4 * 4000 = 3000 students.
* To find the difference, we subtract: 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

"The Adams family made 7995 cookies in total. They already made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.  To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract those two types of cookies from the total. 

So, 7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2225 

They made 2225 chocolate chip cookies.

"Okay, so we need to find out how much money the girls raised together. 

* Alexandra makes $430.
* Kim makes $320 more than Alexandra, so she makes $430 + $320 = $750.
* Maryam makes $400 more than Sarah, who makes $300. So Maryam makes $400 + $300 = $700.
* To find the total, we add up all their amounts: $750 + $700 + $300 = $1750.

So the answer is $1750.

"
"Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night.  They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  How much money does he make in a week if he's open 2 days a week?

**Here's how to figure it out:**

* **Meals cost:** 2 meals * $5/meal = $10
* **Total cost:** $10 + $5 = $15
* **Cost for 2 days:** $15/night * 2 nights = $30
* **Total earnings:** $30

**Answer:** $30

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **James's age:** Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. James is twice her age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's age:** James was born when John was 19, so John is currently 19 + 32 = 51 years old.
* **The youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son was born when John was 32, so he is currently 32 years old. In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.
