"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Relationships**

* Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed.
* Her skipping speed is half her running speed.

**Setting up the Variables**

Let's use the following variables:

*  *r* = Dana's running speed (miles per hour)
*  *w* = Dana's walking speed (miles per hour)

**Formulating Equations**

We know:

*  *r = 4w* 
*  *w = 3 miles/hour* (given)
*  *r = 2w* (from the first equation)

**Solving for Running and Walking Time**

* Dana spends 2 hours running.
* Dana spends 4 hours walking.

**Calculating Total Distance**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance running = *r* * 2 hours = 4w * 2 hours = 8w miles
* Distance walking = *w* * 4 hours = 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

**Total Distance**

* Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
* Total distance = 8w + 12 miles

**Substituting and Simplifying**

* Since *r = 4w*, we can substitute *r* with 4w in the total distance equation.
* Total distance = 8w + 12 miles = 8 * (3 miles/hour) + 12 miles = 24 miles

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's represent Grace's weight:**  Let 'G' represent Grace's weight in pounds.
* **Alex's weight:** Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight, so we can represent Alex's weight as 'A' and write the equation: A = 4G - 2.
* **Combined weight:** The combined weight of Grace and Alex is G + A.

Now, we can substitute the value of A from the equation into the combined weight expression: G + (4G - 2) = 5G - 2.

Finally, we can solve for G: 
* 5G - 2 = 623
* 5G = 625
* G = 125

Now that we know Grace's weight (G = 125), we can find Alex's weight:

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Define variables:** Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

* **Formulate the equation:**  We know he baked twice as many this year, so this year's total is 2x.  He baked 15 more than intended, meaning he baked 2x + 15 cookies.  After dropping 5, he has 110 cookies.  This can be represented as: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110

* **Solve for x:**  Simplify the equation: 2x + 10 = 110.  Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 100.  Divide both sides by 2: x = 50.

**Answer:** Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Let's break down this problem. We're given a ratio of sugar to water in Katy's coffee recipe: 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  

We know she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar.  To find out how many teaspoons she used, we can use the following steps:

1. **Find the value of one part:**  Since the ratio is 7:13, we need to determine the value of one part of the ratio.  We can do this by setting up an equation: 7x = 120 teaspoons.  Solving for x, we get x = 120/7 = 17.14 (approximately).

"The hospital's profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of doctor's services from the revenue generated from patient charges. 

First, we need to determine the total revenue from patient charges.  The hospital sees 500 patients per day, and each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.  Therefore, the total time spent by patients is 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.  

Next, we need to convert the total time spent by patients into hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.  

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour for their services.  Therefore, the total revenue from patient charges is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

Finally, we need to calculate the total revenue from doctor's fees.  The hospital charges doctors $150 per hour for their services.  Therefore, the total revenue from doctor's fees is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The hospital's profit is the difference between the total revenue from patient charges and the total revenue from doctor's fees.  Therefore, the hospital's profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let Jan's current age be represented by 'j'
    * Let Mark's current age be represented by 'm'

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    *  ""Jean is two years older than Mark"" translates to:  j = m + 2
    *  ""Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age"" translates to: m - 2 = (j - 2) / 2

* **Solve for 'j' (Jan's current age):**
    * Substitute the value of 'j' from the first equation into the second equation: m - 2 = (m + 2 - 2) / 2
    * Simplify: m - 2 = m / 2
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 2m - 4 = m
    * Solve for 'm': m = 4

* **Solve for 'j' (Jan's current age):**
    * Substitute the value of 'm' back into the equation j = m + 2: j = 4 + 2
    * Therefore, j = 6

* **Answer:** Jean is currently 6 years old.

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

Here's why:

The key is to understand the pattern of the less well-rounded team's times.  Each runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.  This means the time for the fourth runner is 69 seconds. 

To find the difference in time between the two teams, we need to calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team and then subtract the total time for the faster team. 

The total time for the less well-rounded team is 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds. 

The total time for the faster team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds. 

The difference in time is 258 - 220 = 38 seconds.

"To determine the relative likelihood of rolling a number greater than 3 versus two even numbers in a row, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each event. 

* **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:** There are three numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die, giving us a probability of 3/6 = 1/2 or 50%.

* **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**  There are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) on the die. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.  The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 or 25%.

* **Calculating the difference:**  The difference in probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

**Answer:**  The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50% and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.  Therefore, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

Let 'x' represent the number of bags the trader sold.  

* **Cost:** The trader paid $20 per bag for the wheat, and he bought 'x' bags, so the total cost is 20x.
* **Transportation:**  Each bag costs $2 to transport, and he transported 'x' bags, so the total transportation cost is 2x.
* **Revenue:** The trader sold each bag for $30, and he sold 'x' bags, so the total revenue is 30x.
* **Profit:** The trader made a profit of $400, which is the difference between revenue and expenses.  

We can express this mathematically as: 30x - (20x + 2x) = 400

Simplifying the equation: 30x - 22x = 400
 
Solving for x: 8x = 400
 
Therefore, x = 50.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

The problem describes a scenario where two pools are emptying at a constant rate. We need to determine the current water level in the small pool.

**Setting up the Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the initial amount of water in the small pool.
* Since the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, it had 2x gallons.

**Calculating the Water Loss:**

* Both pools lose 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, resulting in a total loss of 4 * 4 = 16 gallons.

**Updating the Water Levels:**

* The big pool now has 4 times the water of the small pool, so it has 2x * 4 = 8x gallons.
* The small pool now has x - 16 gallons.

**Formulating the Equation:**

* We know that the big pool has 8x gallons, and the small pool has x - 16 gallons.  We also know that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool. This translates to the equation: 8x = 4(x - 16).

**Solving for x:**

* 8x = 4x - 64
* 4x = -64
* x = -16

**Addressing the Issue:**

* We arrive at a negative value for 'x'. This indicates that the problem setup is inconsistent. It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way. 


**Conclusion:**

The problem as presented is not logically sound. There is no solution that satisfies the given conditions.

Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, while her mom adds half that amount, meaning she adds 2 pieces per minute.  Their combined rate is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The total number of pieces is 360.  To find the time required, we divide the total pieces by the combined rate:

Time = Total pieces / Combined rate 
Time = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Finally, we convert this to hours: 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the equal groups.**

* **The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Simplifying the equation:** 3x - 10 = 200

* **Solving for x:** 3x = 210, therefore x = 70.

* **The number of students in the smallest group is 70 - 10 = 60.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

1.  **Total animals:** c + w = 60 
2.  **Chickens vs. Cows:** c = 2w

**Solving for 'c' and 'w':**

From the second equation, we can isolate 'c': c = 2w.

Substitute this value of 'c' into the first equation: (2w) + w = 60

Combine like terms: 3w = 60

Solve for 'w': w = 60 / 3 = 20

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 2w: c = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculating Total Legs:**

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so there are 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so there are 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.

Finally, the total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.


**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

* One ball is lost, leaving him with 2 - 1 = 1 ball.

Therefore, Josh has **1** ball left. 
"
"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Pink Frog:** We know the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
* **Blue Beetle:**  The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle, so the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.
* **Green Toad:**  The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad, so the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.
* **Yellow Snake:** The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, meaning the yellow snake weighs 50 pounds + 10 pounds = 60 pounds.
* **Red Bird:** The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50 pounds - 20 pounds = 30 pounds.
* **Total Weight:** The total weight of the container and the animals is 20 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 60 pounds + 30 pounds = 190 pounds.

Therefore, the total weight of the container and the animals is 190 pounds.

"To determine Tyson's total distance for June, we need to consider his daily running distance and the number of days in the month. 

First, we need to calculate Tyson's new daily distance after his coach's advice.  His coach wants him to run 1/5 more than his current 5000 meters, so his new daily distance is 5000 meters + (1/5) * 5000 meters = 6000 meters.

Next, we need to calculate the total distance he covers in June, which is 30 days.  Therefore, his total distance for June is 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.


**Answer:** 180,000 meters

"To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and then subtract that from the cost of the phone. 

First, let's calculate her earnings from her first job: 20 hours * $10/hour = $200. 

Next, we need to calculate her earnings from her second job: 15 hours * $5/hour = $75.

Finally, we add her earnings from both jobs: $200 + $75 = $275.

Subtracting her total earnings from the cost of the phone, we find that she still needs $400 - $275 = $125.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the height of the shortest tree.
    * The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest, so its height is x + 5.
    * The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shorter trees.

* **Set up the equation:** The combined height of the shorter trees is x + (x + 5) = 2x + 5.  The tallest tree is twice this combined height, so its height is 2(2x + 5) = 4x + 10.

* **Solve for x:** We know the shortest tree is 6 feet tall.  

* **Find the height of the second tree:** The second tree is x + 5 feet tall.

* **Find the height of the tallest tree:** The tallest tree is 4x + 10 feet tall.

* **Determine the value of x:** We know the shortest tree is 6 feet tall.  Therefore, x = 6.

* **Calculate the height of the second tree:** The second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.

* **Calculate the height of the tallest tree:** The tallest tree is 4(6) + 10 = 24 feet tall.

"The train travels a total of 225 miles per trip.  Since it makes 3 trips per day, the total distance traveled in a day is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles.  To determine the number of days between service intervals, we need to find the number of days required to cover 18,000 miles.  Dividing the total distance by the distance traveled per trip, we get 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.  Rounding to the nearest whole number, the train needs service every **27 days**.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Calculate the time to reach the friend's house.**

* Distance: 200 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (approximately)

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the detour.**

* Distance: 10 miles
* Speed: 70 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours (approximately)

**Step 3: Calculate the time to return home.**

* Distance: 240 miles
* Speed: 80 mph
* Time = Distance / Speed = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the total time.**

* Time to reach friend's house: 2.86 hours
* Time for detour: 0.14 hours
* Time to return home: 3 hours
* Total time = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours

**Therefore, the total trip time is 6.00 hours.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Mask Refusal:**  We know 3 customers were removed for refusing to wear masks.
* **Shoplifting:**  The number of people removed for shoplifting is 4 times the number of mask refusals, minus 5.  This means 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 people were removed for shoplifting.
* **Physical Violence:** Three times the number of shoplifters were removed for physical violence. This means 3 * 7 = 21 people were removed for physical violence.
* **Total:** To find the number of people removed for other reasons, we subtract the number removed for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people removed: 50 - 3 - 7 - 21 = 10.

"Let's break down the sales figures:

* **Friday:** They sold 14 pairs.
* **Saturday:** They sold double that amount, so 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.
* **Sunday:** They sold half the number from Saturday, so 28 / 2 = 14 pairs.

To find the total number of shoes sold, we add the sales from each day: 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 pairs.

"Let's solve this problem using a variable to represent the original amount of land.  

Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.  We know that he sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  This can be represented as:

(3/5)x = 12.8

To find the original amount of land, we can solve for 'x'.  

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3: 
   x = 12.8 * (5/3)

* Calculate: x = 21.33 hectares (approximately)

**Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had approximately 21.33 hectares of land.**

"Tim's cable subscription cost $60, and he's switching to streaming services.  He'll pay $10 for Netflix, and Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% when bundling.  

To find the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle, we first calculate the cost of each individually: $10 + $10 = $20.  Then, we calculate the bundled price: $20 * 0.20 = $4.  This means the total cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle is $20 - $4 = $16.  

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of his cable package: $60.  The savings he'll experience is $60 - $16 = $44.

"To solve this problem, we need to consider the fractions representing the slices given to Bill and Mark.  

* **Bill's share:** 1/3 of the pizza.
* **Mark's share:** 1/4 of the pizza.

To find the total amount given away, we add these fractions: 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12.

* **Total slices given away:** 7/12 of the pizza.

We need to find the number of slices remaining after Bill and Mark receive their portions.  

* **Slices remaining:** 12 - (7/12) = 12 * (12/12) - (7/12) = 144/12 - 7/12 = 137/12.

* **Slices remaining:** 137/12 = 11.41666667.

"To determine the difference between the number of flour bags and milk bottles Mark needs, we can calculate the ratio of flour to milk.  The recipe requires 3 cups of flour to 1 cup of milk.  

Since Mark needs 3 cups of flour for a quadruple batch, he needs 3 cups / 1 cup = 3 times the amount of milk.  

To find the number of bags of flour, we need to consider the ratio of flour to milk.  Since he needs 3 times the amount of milk, he needs 3 * 2 = 6 bags of flour. 

To find the number of bottles of milk, we need to consider the ratio of flour to milk.  Since he needs 3 times the amount of milk, he needs 3 * 2 = 6 bottles of milk. 

The difference between the number of flour bags and milk bottles is 6 - 6 = 0.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts of power for 8 hours per day.  We need to determine the energy savings when he reduces his usage by 5 hours.

**Calculations**

* **Daily Energy Consumption:** The AC uses 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours per day.
* **Reduced Daily Energy Consumption:**  Mel reduces his usage by 5 hours, so he uses 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours per day.
* **Energy Saved:** The difference in energy consumption is 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours per day.
* **Total Energy Saved in 30 Days:** Over 30 days, he saves 4500 watt-hours/day * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.
* **Converting to Kilowatt-hours:** 135,000 watt-hours / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours (kWh).

**Answer:** Mel will save **135 kWh** of energy in 30 days.

"To determine the total cost of Tyson's muffaletta sandwiches, we need to consider the cost per pound for both the meat and cheese, and the number of sandwiches needed. 

* **Meat:** Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat, and Tyson needs enough for 5 sandwiches, so he'll need 5 pounds of meat. The cost per pound of meat is $7.00. Therefore, the total cost of the meat is 5 pounds * $7.00/pound = $35.00.

* **Cheese:** Similarly, each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese, and he needs 5 pounds for 5 sandwiches. The cost per pound of cheese is $3.00, so the total cost of the cheese is 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00.

Finally, the total cost of the meat and cheese is $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Elliott walked half his 10,000 steps to and from school, so he walked 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps.
* He then took 1,000 steps on his walk with his friend.
* He had 2,000 steps remaining after his jog.

To find the number of steps he took during his jog, we need to subtract the steps he took to and from school and his walk with his friend from the total number of steps he had left: 2,000 - 5,000 - 1,000 = -4,000. 

This result doesn't make sense, as you can't have a negative number of steps. This means there's likely an error in the problem statement.

* **Seashells:**  The seashells cost $1.50.
* **Magnets:**  The magnets cost $0.25 each, and Sally buys 4, so the total cost is $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.

**Total Cost:** $1.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $4.00

**Remaining Funds:** $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00

"Let's break down the cost of Tim's fireworks. 

* **Cost of the second pack:** The second pack costs twice the price of the first pack, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.
* **Total cost before discount:** The total cost of the fireworks before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.
* **Discount amount:** The discount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.
* **Final cost after discount:** After the discount, Tim spends $1200 - $240 = $960.
* **Total cost including finale:** The total cost including the finale firework is $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110 on his fireworks.

"The question presents a scenario where we need to find the number of candles that are both defective and explode.  

Here's how to approach this:

* **Understanding the Problem:** We are given that 5% of the candles are defective and have a wet dog smell. We are also given that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.  We need to find the number of candles that meet both criteria.

* **Solution:**  The key is to recognize that the information about the candles being defective and exploding is independent.  We can use the following logic:

    * **Defective candles:** 5% of 50,000 candles = 2,500 candles
    * **Exploding candles:**  We are given that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. This means that the number of exploding candles is the number of defective candles.

* **Answer:** 2,500

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels.
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:

*  The total number of heads is 180:  c + d = 180
*  The total number of bumps is 304: 2c + d = 304

We can solve for 'c' in the first equation: c = 180 - d

Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Cost of jogger jeans:** The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
* **Total cost:** Cole spent a total of $28 (tattered jeans) + $22 (jogger jeans) = $50 on the jeans.
* **Savings:** Cole saved $6 in total.
* **Savings from jogger jeans:**  He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6 * (1/3) = $2.
* **Savings from tattered jeans:**  He saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.
* **Original price of jogger jeans:**  We know Cole saved $4 from the tattered jeans, and the total savings was $6.  Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans was $6 / (1/3) = $18.
* **Difference in price:** The original price of the jogger jeans was $18, and the price of the tattered jeans was $28. The difference is $28 - $18 = $10.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders.**
* **The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought feeders, so they attract 'x + 10' birds.**
* **The total number of birds attracted by both types of feeders is 20 + (x + 10) = 30 + x birds.**
* **Since Lillian has 3 homemade feeders and 3 store-bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted is 3(x + 10) + 3(20) = 3x + 30 + 60 = 3x + 90 birds.**
* **To find the total number of birds, we need to find the value of 'x'.** 
* **The total number of birds attracted by both types of feeders is 3x + 90 birds.**
* **We know that the total number of birds attracted by both types of feeders is 50 birds.**
* **Therefore, 3x + 90 = 50**
* **Solving for x, we get 3x = -40, so x = -40/3. This is not a realistic number of birds.**

**Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with.**

* **Earnings from selling cards:** Kenny can earn $1.5x dollars from selling his cards.

* **Cost of the amusement park ticket:** The ticket costs $100.

* **Spending cash:** Kenny has $50 to spend.

* **Setting up the equation:**  We know that the earnings from selling the cards must cover the cost of the ticket, so: 1.5x = $100

* **Solving for x:**  To find the number of cards, we need to isolate 'x'. Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.5 gives us: x = $100 / $1.5 = 66.67

* **Rounding to the nearest whole number:**  Since we can't have a fraction of a card, we round 66.67 to the nearest whole number, which is 67.

**Therefore, Kenny started with approximately 67 Pokemon cards.**

"To solve this, we need to consider the units of measurement.  We are given the total volume of gas in gallons and the fraction of a container Josey used.  

First, we need to determine the volume of one container.  Since 15 gallons are divided into 5 containers, each container holds 15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons.

Next, we need to determine the amount of gasoline Josey used.  She used 1/4 of a container, which is (1/4) * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons.

Finally, we need to convert gallons to pints.  Since 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints, Josey used 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.

"Let's break down the problem:

We're given two options for purchasing a movie experience:

* **Option 1:** A ""Super Ticket"" for $20, which grants access to any movie and includes a popcorn and soda combo for an additional $1.
* **Option 2:** A regular movie ticket for $12, with a separate purchase of a popcorn and soda at regular price.

We're told that you saved $2 by choosing the cheaper option.  We need to find the regular price of the popcorn.

**Here's how to solve:**

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket Combo:** The Super Ticket combo costs $20 (ticket) + $1 (popcorn/soda) = $21.

2. **Cost of the Regular Ticket Combo:** You saved $2, so the regular ticket and combo cost $21 - $2 = $19.

3. **Cost of the Popcorn/Soda Combo:** The regular ticket and combo cost $19, and the soda costs $3, so the popcorn/soda combo costs $19 - $3 = $16.

4. **Regular Popcorn Price:** The popcorn/soda combo costs $16, and the soda costs $3, so the popcorn costs $16 - $3 = $13.

**Answer:** The regular price of popcorn is $13.

"The average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.  

* **Step 1: Calculate the distances traveled in each segment.**
    * Segment 1: Distance = 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles
    * Segment 2: Distance = 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles
* **Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled.**
    * Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles
* **Step 3: Calculate the total time taken.**
    * Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours
* **Step 4: Calculate the average speed.**
    * Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is **50 mph**.

"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to make, we need to consider the weight of each type of feed and the capacity of his truck. 

First, let's calculate the total weight of each feed type:

* Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Next, we need to add up the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

Finally, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips: 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips.

Therefore, the farmer needs to make **2** trips.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Let 'x' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

* The problem states that Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room.  This translates to the equation: 0.5x + 2 = total cookies.

* We know Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies.  

* We can now solve for 'x' by setting up an equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5.

* Solving for 'x', we get:
    * Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
    * Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

"Let's break down the problem. We know that 3/4 of the students at a certain grade level have a desktop computer at home.  This means that 1/4 of the students do not have a desktop computer.  We are given that 20 students do not have a desktop computer.  

To find the total number of students, we can use the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of students.
*  We know that (3/4)x - 20 = 1/4 * x

Solving for 'x', we get:

*  Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: 3x - 80 = x
*  Subtract x from both sides: 2x - 80 = 0
*  Add 80 to both sides: 2x = 80
*  Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Therefore, there are **40** students at that grade level.

We know Tom spent $48 in total.  We also know he spent $4 on a CD.  To find out how much he spent on the headphones, we can subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount: $48 - $4 = $44.  

The question asks how many more CDs he could have bought if he hadn't bought the headphones.  To find this, we divide the amount spent on the headphones by the cost of a single CD: $44 / $4 = 11.  

Therefore, Tom could have bought 11 more CDs.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Jame's age in 5 years:**  We know Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so he is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

* **Twice Jame's age in 8 years:**  In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.  Twice his age in 8 years will be 30 * 2 = 60.

* **Cousin's age in 8 years:**  In 8 years, his cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

* **Age difference:** The age difference between Jame and his cousin in 8 years will be 55 - 30 = 25 years.

* **Age difference now:**  Since the question asks for the age difference *now*, we need to consider the age difference in 8 years.  The age difference is 25 years.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

Let's break down the information given:

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of the computer.**
* **The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so it cost x - $400.**
* **The total cost of the computer, printer, and monitors is $2400.**  

We can set up an equation: 
x + (x - $400) + 2 * (cost of one monitor) = $2400

We know the computer cost $1100, so we can substitute that in:
1100 + (1100 - $400) + 2 * (cost of one monitor) = $2400

Simplifying the equation:
2200 + 2 * (cost of one monitor) = $2400

Solving for the cost of one monitor:
2 * (cost of one monitor) = $2400 - 2200
2 * (cost of one monitor) = $200
cost of one monitor = $100

**Answer:** $100

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total shells brought by the boys:** The boys brought 60 shells each, and there were 2 groups, so they brought a total of 60 * 2 = 120 shells.
* **Girls' contribution:** The girls brought an amount equal to the boys' shells plus four times the number of shells the boys brought. This can be represented as 120 + (4 * 60) = 120 + 240 = 360 shells.
* **Shells per girl:**  To find the number of shells brought by each girl, we divide the total shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 360 shells / 10 girls = 36 shells/girl.

"Let's break down the problem. Elvis has a monthly savings goal of $1125. To reach this goal, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month compared to the first half. 

To find the daily savings in the second half, we need to consider the following:

* **First half savings:**  We need to determine how much Elvis saves in the first half of the month. 
* **Second half savings:**  He wants to save twice the amount in the second half, so we need to calculate that amount.
* **Daily savings in the second half:**  Finally, we can determine the daily savings in the second half by dividing the total second half savings by the number of days in the second half.

Let's calculate:

* **First half savings:**  $1125 / 2 = $562.50
* **Second half savings:** $562.50 * 2 = $1125
* **Daily savings in the second half:** $1125 / 15 days = $75 per day

"To determine the correct oven temperature, we need to account for the discrepancy between the set temperature and the actual temperature.  

The oven is 18 degrees hotter than the set temperature, so we need to adjust the target temperature to account for this.  

The target temperature is 520 degrees.  

To find the adjusted temperature, we can use the following formula:

Adjusted Temperature = Target Temperature + (Percentage Difference * Target Temperature)

Percentage Difference = 18 degrees / 450 degrees = 0.04

Adjusted Temperature = 520 degrees + (0.04 * 520 degrees) = 520 degrees + 20.8 degrees = 540.8 degrees

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach. 

Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  The problem states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, meaning the number of red jelly beans is 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans.  Similarly, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, meaning the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of the three types:

*  b (blue) + 0.99b (red) + 1.01b (green) = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, to find the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

"To determine the additional time required to travel 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to find the plane's speed.  

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, to find the time to travel an additional 2000 miles, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take **5 hours** to travel the additional 2000 miles.

"To determine the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together, we need to consider the production rate of each individual and the total time they worked. 

* **Ruiz's production:** Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.  This means his production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.
* **Marissa's production:** Marissa makes 3/4 times the amount Ruiz makes in an hour, so her production rate is (3/4) * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds per hour.
* **Total production:**  Over 12 hours, Ruiz produces 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa produces 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.  Therefore, their combined production is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"To determine the number of years before the tires need to be replaced, we need to consider the relationship between the number of miles driven and the number of rotations per mile. 

First, we need to calculate the total rotations for Jeremy's 400 miles.  Since the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles, we can calculate the total rotations as follows:

* Total rotations = (Miles driven) / (Rotations per mile) 
* Total rotations = 400 miles / 2 miles/rotation = 200 rotations

Now, we need to consider the total rotations per year.  We know that each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations.  

Finally, we can calculate the number of years it takes for the tires to reach the limit of their rotations. 

* Years to replace tires = (Total rotations per year) / (Total rotations per tire)
* Years to replace tires = 125,280,000 rotations / 10,440,000 rotations/tire = 12 years

**Therefore, it will take approximately 12 years for the tires to need to be replaced.**

"To determine the cost per pump, we need to find the cost per wash and then divide that by the number of pumps used.  

The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and is designed for 120 washes.  This means that each pump provides enough shampoo for 120 washes. 

Therefore, the cost per pump is $24.00 / 120 washes = $0.20 per wash.  

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the cost per pump is $0.20 * 100 cents/dollar = 20 cents. 


**Answer:** 20 cents

"To determine the final amount Joe has left after the purchase, we need to consider the total cost of the outfit and the sales tax. 

First, calculate the price of the shirt after the discount: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. 

Next, add the price of the shorts, which is $35, to the discounted shirt price: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Finally, calculate the sales tax, assuming a 6% rate.  The sales tax amount would be $52.50 * 0.06 = $3.15.

Therefore, the final price of the outfit, including sales tax, is $52.50 + $3.15 = $55.65.

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second. To convert this to megabits per hour, we need to consider the conversion factor between kilobits and megabits.  

* 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb). 

Therefore, her internet speed is 20 kb/second * 1000 = 20000 kb/second.

To convert this to megabits per hour, we need to multiply by 60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour:

20000 kb/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 72,000,000 kb/hour.

Finally, we convert the result to megabits per hour: 72,000,000 kb/hour / 1000 = **72 Mb/hour**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Gold Jewell:** The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 the price of a diamond Jewell.  We know the diamond Jewell costs $2000.  Therefore, the gold Jewell costs (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.
* **Silver Jewell:** The silver Jewell costs $400 less than the gold Jewell.  So, the silver Jewell costs $1600 - $400 = $1200.
* **Total Price:** To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels: $2000 (diamond) + $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver) = $4800.

**Answer:** The total price for all three jewels is $4800.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Snowflake stamps:** Max purchased 16 of these.
* **Truck stamps:** He bought 3 more than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = 19 of these.
* **Rose stamps:** He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, meaning he bought 19 - 9 = 10 of these.
* **Total stamps:** To find the total, we add the number of each type of stamp: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps.

"To determine the time it takes Tom to catch up to Bob, we need to consider the relative speed at which Tom is closing the distance between them.  

The relative speed is the difference in their speeds: 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

Therefore, Tom will take 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours to close the 75-mile gap. 


**Answer:** 5 hours

"Manny's parents have a budget of $10 per class, and he's signed up for 10 classes.  To determine how many classes he can miss before exceeding the budget, we need to consider the total cost. 

The total cost of the classes is calculated as follows:

* Cost per class: $10
* Number of classes: 10

Therefore, the total cost is $10 * 10 = $100.

To determine the maximum number of classes he can miss without exceeding the budget, we divide the total cost by the cost per class:

* Total cost: $100
* Cost per class: $10

The maximum number of classes he can miss is $100 / $10 = 10.

"To find the total weekly production, we need to consider the individual rates of Julie and Jewel.  

* Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
* Julie processes twice as fast as Jewel, meaning she processes 50 * 2 = 100 customers per day.

To find the total weekly production, we need to consider the number of customers processed by each person over the entire week.

* Julie processes 100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers per week.
* Jewel processes 50 customers/day * 7 days/week = 350 customers per week.

Therefore, the total weekly production is 700 + 350 = 1050 customers.

"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can break down the problem using the given information. 

We know that four apples cost $5.20.  Therefore, the cost of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

Similarly, three oranges cost $3.30.  Thus, the cost of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

The total cost of 5 apples is then 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

The total cost of 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

Finally, the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To determine the time required to dig the hole, we need to consider the volume of the hole and the shoveling rate. 

The volume of the hole is calculated as length x width x depth, which in this case is 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.

The shoveling rate is given as 3 seconds per cubic foot.  Therefore, the total time to dig the hole is simply the volume divided by the shoveling rate: 72 cubic feet / 3 seconds/cubic foot = 24 seconds.

"The base price of the truck is $30,000.  The additional features are: a king cab upgrade at $7,500, leather seats at $2,500, running boards at $2,000, and the upgraded exterior light package at $1,500.  

To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of each feature: $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500.  

Finally, we add the cost of the base truck to the cost of the extras: $30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500. 

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

"To find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to consider the distance traveled by each individual and then sum their distances. 

* **Alisa's distance:**  We know Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours.  Therefore, her distance is calculated as: 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

* **Stanley's distance:**  Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours.  His distance is calculated as: 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

* **Understanding the Rates:** Bill's digging speed is given as 4 feet per hour for soil and half that speed for clay. This means his clay digging speed is 4/2 = 2 feet per hour.

* **Calculating Time for Soil:**  We know Bill needs to dig 24 feet of soil.  To find the time required, we divide the total distance by his soil digging speed: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.

* **Calculating Time for Clay:** Similarly, he needs to dig 8 feet of clay.  His clay digging speed is 2 feet per hour, so the time required is 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

* **Total Time:**  To find the total time, we add the time spent on soil and clay: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.


**Answer:** It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Day 1:** Clara buys 20 pomegranates at $20 each, resulting in a total cost of $400. She receives a $2 discount, bringing the price per pomegranate to $18.  The total cost for 20 pomegranates on this day is $360.

* **Day 2:** The price of a pomegranate increases to $30.  Sheila buys 20 pomegranates, incurring a total cost of $600.  However, a 10% discount is applied, reducing the final price to $540.

To find the difference in price, we subtract the cost on Day 1 from the cost on Day 2: $540 - $360 = $180.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Red Hat Sales:** Ariadne sold $400 worth of red hats.
* **Green Hat Sales:** Her green hat sales were half the amount of red hats, so she earned $400 / 2 = $200.
* **Total Sales (Month 1):** Her total sales for the first month were $400 (red) + $200 (green) = $600.
* **Month 2 Sales:** Her sales in the second month were 3/4 of her first month's sales, meaning she earned (3/4) * $600 = $450.
* **Total Sales (Two Months):**  Her total sales over two months were $600 (month 1) + $450 (month 2) = $1050.


Therefore, Ariadne made a total of $1050 in two months.

"To determine the amount withheld from Sally's wage, we need to consider the difference between her current bank balance and her expected earnings. 

We know her bank balance is $420 after a week, and she started with $200. This means she earned $420 - $200 = $220 during the week.

Since her expected wage is $300, and she earned $220, we can calculate the amount withheld: $300 - $220 = $80.

"Lori needs 2 dozens of eggs. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Eggs per guest:**  She needs 3 deviled egg halves per guest.
* **Total deviled egg halves:**  She's serving 16 guests, so she'll need 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves.
* **Eggs needed:**  Each deviled egg requires 1 egg, so she'll need 48 deviled egg halves / 2 halves/egg = 24 eggs.
* **Dozens needed:**  Since she needs 24 eggs, she'll need 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens.

"To determine the total cost of owning and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to consider the initial purchase price and the recurring expenses. 

The plane cost $150,000.  Additionally, he pays $5,000 per month in hangar rent.  He also spends twice the amount on fuel, which is $5,000 * 2 = $10,000 per month.

To calculate the total annual cost, we need to consider the monthly expenses and multiply them by 12 months. 

The total monthly cost is $5,000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000.  

Therefore, the total cost for the first year is $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Pork cooking time:** Finley states that pork takes 20 minutes longer than rice, so it takes 30 minutes (rice cooking time) + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.
* **Combined cooking time of rice and pork:** The total time for rice and pork is 30 minutes + 50 minutes = 80 minutes.
* **Bean cooking time:** Beans take half the combined time of rice and pork, meaning they take 80 minutes / 2 = 40 minutes.
* **Total cooking time:**  The total time to cook all the food is 30 minutes (rice) + 50 minutes (pork) + 40 minutes (beans) = 120 minutes.

"Here's how to solve this problem using a system of equations:

Let:

*  *s* represent the number of sheep
*  *g* represent the number of geese

We are given the following information:

*  Total legs: 4s + 2g = 70
*  Total heads: s + g = 20

To solve for the number of sheep (*s*), we can use a system of equations.  

**Solving for 'g' in terms of 's' from the second equation:**

* s + g = 20
* g = 20 - s

**Substituting this value of 'g' into the first equation:**

* 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

**Simplifying and solving for 's':**

* 4s + 40 - 2s = 70
* 2s + 40 = 70
* 2s = 30
* s = 15

**Answer:** There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"John takes a cooking class for 6 weeks, meeting 4 times a week for 2 hours each session.  Since he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours of class time, we can calculate the total number of recipes he learns by dividing the total class time by the time required to learn one recipe. 

The total class time is 8 hours (4 classes * 2 hours/class).  

To find the number of recipes, we divide the total class time by the time per recipe: 8 hours / 1.5 hours/recipe = 5.33 recipes. 

Since we can't learn parts of a recipe, we round down to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, John learns **5** recipes.

The total cost of the type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.
The total cost of the candies is $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00.
Therefore, Adam received $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00 in change.

"Let's break down the problem:

We are given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.  We also know that Janey has 21 books.  

Let's use the variable 'x' to represent the number of books Sally has.  

* Twice the number of books Sally has is 2x.
* Janey has 3 more than twice Sally's books, so she has 2x + 3.

We can set up an equation: 2x + 3 = 21

Solving for x:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 18
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 9

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To determine the number of days it will take for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches, we need to consider its daily growth rate.  

The bamboo grows 30 inches per day.  We can use this information to calculate the number of days required to reach the desired height.

First, we need to convert the initial height from feet to inches: 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.

Now, we can calculate the number of days: 600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days.

Therefore, it will take **20 days** for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Initial toys:** James starts with 4 toys and needs 1 toy per dog, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 toys.
* **New dogs:**  The shelter now has 12 dogs.
* **Double the dogs:**  There are twice as many dogs as when James started, meaning there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.
* **Total toys needed:**  To accommodate the 24 dogs, James needs 24 * 1 = 24 toys.
* **Toys purchased:**  James needs to buy 24 toys - 16 toys = 8 more toys.
* **Final count:**  James now has 16 + 8 = 24 toys.

"To determine the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes, we can use a direct proportionality relationship.  Since 6 potatoes produce 36 hash browns, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of hash browns you can make from 96 potatoes. 
*  The proportion is: 6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

Solving for 'x', we get:

*  6x = 36 * 96
*  6x = 3456
*  x = 3456 / 6
*  x = 576

Therefore, you can make **576** hash browns from 96 potatoes.

"Let's break down the problem:

We are given that there is a set of twins and a set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.  We are also given that the combined ages of the twins and triplets is 44. 

Let's use variables to represent the ages:

* Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
* Let '3t' represent the age of the triplet.

We can set up an equation based on the given information:

t + 3t = 44

This simplifies to:

4t = 44

To solve for 't', we divide both sides by 4:

t = 11

Therefore, one of the twins is 11 years old.

"To determine how much time John has for napping, we need to consider the total time he has available and the time dedicated to his homework. 

First, let's calculate the total time spent on homework: 20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes.

Next, we need to convert the 3-hour dinner time into minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Finally, we subtract the homework time from the total available time: 180 minutes (dinner time) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has **100 minutes** to nap.

"To determine the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need to consider the cost of each item separately. 

* **Lollipops:**  Each lollipop costs $0.40.  Therefore, 10 lollipops would cost 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.
* **Candies:** The cost of four candies is $3.20.  Since we want to find the cost of 10 candies, we need to consider the cost per candy and multiply it by 10.  This gives us 10 * $1.20 = $12.00.

Finally, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the lollipops and the cost of the candies: $4.00 + $12.00 = $16.00.

"To determine Gerald's remaining money, we need to first understand the relationship between the ratio and the total amount of money.  

The ratio 3:2 represents the proportion of money Gerald and Julia have.  This means that for every $3 Gerald has, Julia has $2.  

To find Gerald's portion of the money, we can calculate the value of one part of the ratio.  The total ratio value is $100, and the ratio parts are 3 + 2 = 5.  Therefore, the value of one part is $100 / 5 = $20.

Gerald has 3 parts of the ratio, so he has 3 * $20 = $60.  

Finally, we can calculate Gerald's remaining money by subtracting the amount he spent from his initial amount: $60 - $10 = $50.

"To find the average time it takes for the cat and dog to eat the sausages, we need to consider the individual eating rates and then calculate the combined time. 

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, which means it eats 1 sausage every 30/9 = 1/3 of an hour.  The dog, on the other hand, eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time the cat takes, which is 30 minutes / (2/3) = 45 minutes.

To find the average time, we need to consider the total time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages. The cat takes 30 minutes and the dog takes 45 minutes, for a total of 30 + 45 = 75 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* The regulation passed with twice the number of votes in favor as against it. 
* This means the number of votes in favor is equal to twice the number of votes against.
* We know the total number of council members is 33.

Let 'x' represent the number of votes against the regulation.  

Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, the number of votes in favor is 2x.

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against: x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms: 3x = 33

Solving for x: x = 33 / 3 = 11

Therefore, the number of votes against the regulation is 11.

The number of votes in favor is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.

He then ordered 100 more, bringing his total to 100 + 100 = 200 candies.  To sell all of his candy, he needs to sell 200 - 100 = 100 more candies.

"Here's how to calculate the number of students who joined the campus:

* **January:** 10 students * 2 = 20 students
* **February:** 20 students * 2 = 40 students
* **March:** 40 students * 2 = 80 students
* **April:** 80 students * 2 = 160 students
* **May:** 160 students * 2 = 320 students

The total number of students who joined the campus is 320 - 10 = **310**

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to consider the total earnings and the cost per branch.  

We know Felix earned $105 and each branch costs $0.25.  To find the total number of branches, we can divide his earnings by the cost per branch:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches/day

**Answer:** 60

"Here's how to solve the problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the total petals from the first group:** 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals
* **Step 2: Calculate the total petals from the second group:** 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals
* **Step 3: Calculate the total petals from the third group:** 5 flowers * 4 petals/flower = 20 petals
* **Step 4: Calculate the total petals from the fourth group:** 6 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 42 petals
* **Step 5: Calculate the total number of petals before dropping any:** 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals
* **Step 6: Calculate the number of flowers after dropping one of each:** 101 - 1 = 100 flowers
* **Step 7: Calculate the total number of petals in the vase:** 100 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 700 petals

**Answer:** 700

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Total marshmallows used:** John and DeSean make 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows remaining:** They start with 35 marshmallows and use 18, leaving 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows.
3. **S'mores each kid can have:**  With 17 marshmallows, each kid can have 17 / 2 = 8.5 s'mores. 

Since you can't have half a s'more, they can each have **8** s'mores.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Time per game:** Jack plays for 20 minutes per game.
* **Friend 1's time:**  They play half as long as Jack, so they play 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per game.
* **Friend 2's time:** They also play half as long as Jack, so they play 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per game.
* **Friend 3's time:** They play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game.
* **Total time:**  The total time they play is 240 minutes (Jack) + 120 minutes (Friend 1) + 60 minutes (Friend 2) + 360 minutes (Friend 3) = 780 minutes.
* **Total games:**  They play for 780 minutes / 20 minutes/game = 39 games.
* **Total cost:**  The total cost is 39 games * $0.25/game = $9.75.


**Answer:** $9.75

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    * Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    * Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    * Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Formulate Equations:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    *  We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    *  We know the total mixture is 10 ounces.

* **Solve for Oil (o):**
    * Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    * Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    * Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x
    * We know x = zest, so o = 4z.

* **Determine the Amount of Oil:**

"To determine the difference in the number of cat food tins and dog food tins, we first need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food. 

* Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
* Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

The difference is then found by subtracting the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins. 

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Let's solve this problem systematically. 

Let's use variables to represent the number of cards each person has:

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying the equation:

7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Blue eggs:** The problem states Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she had 5 green eggs. Therefore, she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* **Pink eggs:**  The problem states she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
* **Yellow eggs:** The problem states she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
* **Total eggs:**  To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs. 


"
"Let's analyze the situation. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.  The book needs to be shipped 20 miles, so the mileage cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.  Therefore, the total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we need to calculate the amount Milly will receive as a refund. Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.  The refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, we can calculate Milly's loss. The total cost of the book, including shipping, is $3.00.  The refund amount is $24.00.  Therefore, Milly will lose $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Week 1:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
* **Week 2:** He produces half of Week 1's output, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He produces three times the output of Week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find the output for week 4, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week. 
"
"To determine Britany's total TikTok time, we need to consider her video creation, song writing, and makeup routine. 

* **Video creation:** She records 18 videos per week, each lasting 4 minutes, totaling 18 * 4 = 72 minutes.
* **Song writing:** She spends 2 hours per week on songwriting, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
* **Makeup:** She spends 15 minutes each day on makeup, totaling 15 * 6 = 90 minutes for the week.

Adding these times together, we get 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes per week.

Finally, we need to consider the time across four weeks, resulting in 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes per month.

"Let's break down the cost of Angela's installation:

* **Mirrors:** Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

Therefore, the total cost of the installation is **$529.00**.

* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning she can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, meaning he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting height in feet:**  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"The key here is to recognize that the distance traveled is constant.  The number of turtles doesn't change the total distance.  We can use the relationship between time, distance, and speed to solve this.

Let's break it down:

* **Kangaroos:**  They travel at a speed of 'x' and take 18 hours to cover a distance of 18x.
* **Turtles:**  Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, which is x/2.  

Since the distance is the same for both, we can set up a proportion:

* Time (Kangaroos) / Distance (Kangaroos) = Time (Turtles) / Distance (Turtles)

Let's plug in the values we know:

* 18/x = Time (Turtles) / 18x

Simplifying the equation:

* 18 * 18x = x * Time (Turtles)
* 324x = x * Time (Turtles)
* 324 = Time (Turtles)

Therefore, it will take **324 hours** for four turtles to travel the same distance.

* **Total dishes:** To find the total, add the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

Therefore, they made a total of 140 clay dishes.

"To find the total length of glue sticks not used, we first need to determine the total length of glue used.  

The total length of glue used is the sum of the lengths of the three partially used glue sticks.  

*  (1/6) + (2/3) + (1/2) = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 = 4/3 

The total length of glue sticks not used is the difference between the original length of the glue sticks and the length of glue used.

* 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 36 mm - 4 mm = 32 mm

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is **32 millimeters**.

"The key here is to break down the problem into smaller parts.  We know there are 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half of the white shirts have collars, meaning 20 of them do.  We also know 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.  To find the difference between floral shirts with no buttons and white shirts with no collars, we need to consider the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars.  We can find the number of floral shirts with no buttons by subtracting the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.  This gives us 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts without buttons.  We can then find the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts.  This gives us 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars.  Finally, we can find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars by subtracting the number of floral shirts with no buttons from the number of white shirts with no collars.  This gives us 30 - 20 = 10.

"To determine the total material needed, we need to consider the material consumption per mask type and the desired number of each mask type. 

* **Small masks:**  Each small mask requires 2 yards of material.  We need to calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks: 2 yards/mask * 20 masks = 40 yards.
* **Large masks:** Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material. We need to calculate the total material needed for 8 large masks: 2.25 yards/mask * 8 masks = 18 yards.
* **Total material:**  The total material needed is the sum of the material required for small and large masks: 40 yards + 18 yards = 58 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 58 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Let 'x' represent the number of acres in Farmer Brown's farm.
* Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's acreage, which can be written as 2x + 100.
* The total acreage of both farms is the sum of their individual acreages: x + (2x + 100).

To find the total acreage, we can simplify the expression:

* x + (2x + 100) = 3x + 100

Therefore, the total acreage of both farms is 3x + 100. 

To find the total acreage, we need to find the value of 'x'.  We know Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.  

* 200 acres is the value of 'x'.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
    * Let Paul's age be 'P + 10' (since he's 10 years older than John)
    * Let John's age be 'J'

* **Formulate equations:**
    * The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100:  P + (P + 10) + J = 100
    * Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: P = (P + 10) + J

* **Solve for the ages:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Solve for J: J = 100 - 2P 

* **Substitute to find Peter's age:**
    * Substitute the value of J into the second equation: P = (P + 10) + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of root crop and then sum the amounts. 

* **Yams:** Jen has 6 yams at a price of $1.50 each, so her earnings from yams are 6 * $1.50 = $9.00.
* **Sweet Potatoes:** She has 10 sweet potatoes at a price of $2.00 each, resulting in 10 * $2.00 = $20.00 in earnings from sweet potatoes.
* **Carrots:** Jen has 4 carrots at a price of $1.25 each, earning 4 * $1.25 = $5.00 from the carrots.

Finally, adding the earnings from each type of root crop, we get $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00. 


Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 from selling her root crops.

"Here's a breakdown of the problem:

* **Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.**  He swims 60% of the lake's 20 miles, which is (60/100) * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Calculate the time spent swimming.**  Time = Distance / Speed, so Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours.

* **Step 3: Calculate the rest time.**  He rests for half the swimming time, so he rests for 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance.**  The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

* **Step 5: Calculate the speed for the remaining distance.**  He swims at half his original speed, so his speed is 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour.

* **Step 6: Calculate the time for the remaining distance.**  Time = Distance / Speed, so Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours.

* **Step 7: Calculate the total time.**  Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Remaining time, so Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

We know that the team scored a total of 45 points.  Each of the three players contributed equally, so we can represent their scores as follows:

* Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
* Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
* Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

We are given the following information:

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

We can use these equations to solve for the individual scores. 

First, let's use the second equation to express B in terms of D:
* B = D + 10

Now, substitute this expression for B into the first equation:
* (A + 20) = (D + 10)

Simplify the equation:
* A + 20 = D + 10
* A = D - 10

Finally, substitute this expression for A into the third equation:
* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:
* 3D + 10 = 45
* 3D = 35
* D = 35/3 
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

Now that we know D, we can find A:
* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)


**Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.**

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to consider the time interval and his stapling rate. 

First, we need to convert the time from AM to hours and minutes.  From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 3 hours.  

Next, we need to calculate the total number of 15-minute intervals within this time frame.  There are 180 minutes in 3 hours.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled by multiplying his stapling rate (30 reports per 15 minutes) by the total number of 15-minute intervals. 

Therefore, Vince stapled 144 reports.

**Combining like terms:**

* 7x = 7

**Solving for x:**

* x = 1

**Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball.**

**To find the total number of balls brought to practice, we need to consider the number of balls each person carried:**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips each of the two people get.** 
* **The third person gets 15 more than the two, so they get x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips is the sum of the chips each person gets.**

We know that the total number of corn chips is 265.  We can set up an equation:

2x + (x + 15) = 265

Now, solve for x:

3x + 15 = 265
3x = 250
x = 83.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a chip, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's assume the problem meant that the third person gets 15 more than the two people. 

**Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 265.**

"Let's solve this problem systematically. 

Let's use variables to represent the number of Pokemon each person has caught:

*  Let A represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
*  Let S represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
*  Let W represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:

* A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
* S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
* A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

**Solving for Stan's catch (S):**

1. **Substitute:**  We can substitute the first equation (A = S + 5) into the third equation:
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339

2. **Simplify:** Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339

3. **Substitute again:** We can substitute the second equation (S = 4W - 13) into this equation:
   2(4W - 13) + W = 339

4. **Simplify:**  Simplify the equation: 8W - 26 + W = 339
   9W - 26 = 339

5. **Solve for W:** Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
   Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56.  We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon.

6. **Find S:** Now that we know W = 41, we can substitute it back into the second equation:
   S = 4(41) - 13
   S = 164 - 13
   Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the bird's movements in a systematic way. 

First, we need to break down the bird's journey into its components:

* **Southward Flight:** The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, covering a distance of 30 * 10 = 300 miles.
* **Northward Flight:** The bird then flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, covering a distance of 18 * 2 = 36 miles.
* **Southward Flight (Final):** The bird then flies south again for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of 22 * 5 = 110 miles.

Finally, we add up the distances from each leg of the journey to get the total distance: 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles.

**Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

* **Initial Charge:**  We need to determine the initial charge of the power bank.  Let's assume the power bank started with a full charge of 100%.

* **First 5 Hours:** The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, resulting in a loss of 9 * 5 = 45% of the initial charge.  The remaining charge after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%.

* **Next 3 Hours:** The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, resulting in a loss of 7 * 3 = 21% of the remaining charge. The remaining charge after 3 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%.

* **Final Charge:** The power bank has 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save for a down payment, we need to consider her weekly earnings and the desired savings amount. 

First, we need to calculate her total weekly earnings:

* Her hourly wage is $10.
* Her hourly tips are $15.
* Her total weekly earnings are $10 + $15 = $25.

Next, we need to determine her weekly savings:

* Her total weekly earnings are $25.
* She wants to save 20% of the car's cost, which is $10000.
* Her weekly savings are $25 * 0.20 = $5.

Finally, we can calculate the number of weeks she needs to work:

* Her total savings needed is $10000.
* Her weekly savings are $5.
* The number of weeks she needs to work is $10000 / $5 = 2000 weeks.


Therefore, Janet needs to work for **2000** weeks to save for the down payment.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**

"Let's analyze the problem systematically.  

Let 'x' represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set.  

* The first set had 4 more balls than the second set, meaning Rory retrieved x + 4 balls.
* The third set had half the number of balls retrieved in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls.
* The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of these three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Now, we can solve for 'x':

1. Combine like terms: (5/2)x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
3. Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

We can now find the number of balls retrieved in the first set: 6 + 4 = 10.

"To determine the total gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to figure out her daily consumption in gallons.  Since she drinks 8 cups of water per day, and there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can calculate this as follows:

8 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons/day

Finally, to find the total gallons consumed over 30 days, we multiply her daily consumption by the number of days:

0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks **15 gallons** of water in 30 days.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Passengers:** Romeo starts with 120 passengers.

2. **First Stop:** 20 more passengers board, bringing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

3. **Second Stop:** 50 passengers disembark, leaving 140 - 50 = 90 passengers.

4. **Third Stop:** Twice the number who disembarked is 50 * 2 = 100 passengers.  This means 100 more passengers board.

5. **Final Count:**  The total number of passengers at the final stop is 90 + 100 + 80 = 270.

"Let's break down Alison's shopping trip:

* **Running shorts:** The shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
* **Sale price of tennis shoes:** The tennis shoes were originally $48, and were on sale for half price, meaning they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
* **Total cost of athletic gear:** The total cost of the tank top, shorts, and tennis shoes is $10 + $15 + $24 = $51.
* **Cost after coupon:**  Alison had a $2 coupon, so the final cost is $51 - $2 = $49.

Therefore, Alison spent $49 on athletic gear.

"To determine the cost of your kitchen floor renovation, we need to consider the area of the floor and the cost per tile. 

The floor has a total area of 200 square feet.  Each tile measures 1 square foot.  To calculate the number of tiles needed, we divide the total area by the area of each tile: 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft/tile = 200 tiles.

The cost of each tile is $12.  Therefore, the total cost of the tiles is 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.

"James' insurance premium has increased by 60% due to the accident.  The normal monthly premium is $120.  To find his annual premium, we need to calculate the increased cost and then multiply it by 12.

The increased cost is 60% of the normal premium, which is (60/100) * $120 = $72.  

Therefore, his new monthly premium is $120 + $72 = $192.

His annual premium is $192 * 12 = $2304.

"Greg's weekly laundry load calculation is a bit tricky because he's doing a fractional load.  Let's break it down:

* **Total beds:** Greg washes 4 twin beds + 1 king bed = 5 beds per week.
* **Twin sets per load:** He washes 2 twin sets per load.
* **King sets per load:** He washes 1 king set per load.
* **Total loads per week:**  He can do 5 beds / 2 sets/load = 2.5 loads per week.
* **Total loads per year:**  Greg does 2.5 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 130 loads per year.

"To determine the total number of movies they watch in 4 weeks, we need to consider the number of movies watched on each day of the weekend. 

They watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that number on Sunday, meaning they watch 4/2 = 2 movies on Sunday.  

Therefore, they watch a total of 4 + 2 = 6 movies each weekend. 

Over 4 weeks, they watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Two years ago:** Leo had 100 stickers.
* **Last year:** He collected 50 stickers.
* **This year:** He collected twice the number of stickers from last year, meaning he collected 50 * 2 = 100 stickers.

To find his total stickers, we add the number of stickers from each year: 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 stickers.

Therefore, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.

"Imma has 3 cats and feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food per feeding.  To determine how many days the food will last, we need to consider the total daily consumption.  

The cats consume 60 grams/feeding * 2 feedings = 120 grams per day.  

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma's cats for 720 grams / 120 grams/day = 6 days.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'J' represent the number of slices Jake ate.
    * Let 'B' represent the number of slices Becky ate.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of slices Silvia ate.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * B = J + 3 (Becky ate 3 more than Jake)
    * S = 2J (Silvia ate twice as many as Jake)
    * B + J + S = 4 * 8 (They shared 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices)

* **Solve for the variables:**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation: (J + 3) + J + 2J = 32
    * Combine like terms: 4J + 3 = 32
    * Subtract 3 from both sides: 4J = 29
    * Divide both sides by 4: J = 7.25 
    * Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem statement.  

**Therefore, there is likely an error in the problem statement, as we cannot have a fraction of a slice.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that Betsy and Donovan worked together to prepare a meal, and the total time was 98 minutes.  We also know that Betsy's portion took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  

Let's represent Donovan's portion of the meal with the variable 'x'.  This means Betsy's portion took 'x + 18' minutes.  

The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for each person's portion: x + (x + 18) = 98.  

Simplifying the equation: 2x + 18 = 98

Solving for x: 
* 2x = 80
* x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion took 40 minutes.  Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Let's break down the doctor's visit costs:

* **Visit:** The visit is charged at $300 per hour, and the visit is 0.5 hours long.  Therefore, the cost of the visit is $300 * 0.5 = $150.
* **Painkillers:** The doctor prescribes 30 painkillers at $4 per pill. The total cost of the painkillers is $4 * 30 = $120.
* **Parking:** The parking is mandatory and costs $6 per hour for a minimum of 2 hours. The total cost of parking is $6 * 2 = $12.

Adding these costs together, the total cost of the visit is $150 + $120 + $12 = $282.

"If each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, then in 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish produced would be the product of the number of jellyfish created per second and the number of seconds in 4 hours. 

To find the number of jellyfish produced in 4 hours, we need to consider the following:

* **Jellyfish per second:**  Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the rate is constant.
* **Time:** We need to convert the time from hours to seconds. 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish produced in 4 hours is:

14400 seconds * jellyfish per second = 14400 jellyfish

"Let's break down the problem.  We're given that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fencing.  We know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  

Let's represent Sam's portion of the fence with the variable 'x'.  This means Harry's portion is 'x + 60'.  

The total length of fencing is the sum of their individual portions: x + (x + 60) = 100.  

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.  Subtracting 60 from both sides, we have 2x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 20.  

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fencing.  To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract Harry's portion from the total: 100 - 80 = 20.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Trekking Bikes:**  We know that half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so we have 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes sold.
* **BMX Bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, which is 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
* **MTB Bikes:**  The remaining bikes were MTB bikes, so we have 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes sold.
* **Revenue Calculation:**
    * MTB Revenue: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
    * BMX Revenue: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
    * Trekking Revenue: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

* **Total Revenue:**  $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500


**Therefore, Marcel earned $70,500 from selling bicycles during that month.**

"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to consider the net change in the hay quantity.  

The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and the truck picks up 3 bales per hour.  Over a 6-hour workday, the farmer contributes 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.  The truck contributes 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.  

The total number of bales produced and picked up is 30 bales + 18 bales = 48 bales.  

Therefore, the number of bales left in the field is 0.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to first calculate the total area of the walls.  The room has two pairs of walls, each with a length of 10 feet and a width of 8 feet.  This gives us a total area of 10 ft * 8 ft = 80 square feet for the north and south walls.  Similarly, the east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, giving us a total area of 5 ft * 8 ft = 40 square feet.  Adding these areas together, we get 80 sq ft + 40 sq ft = 120 square feet.

Next, we need to determine the number of gallons of paint required.  Since each gallon covers 20 square feet, we can divide the total area of the walls by the coverage per gallon to find the number of gallons needed.  This gives us 120 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 6 gallons.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost.  Each gallon of paint costs $12, so we multiply the number of gallons needed by the price per gallon to get the total cost.  This gives us 6 gallons * $12/gallon = $72.

"To determine the number of years Lauren needs to work, we need to consider her annual savings, living expenses, and the total amount she needs to accumulate for retirement. 

First, we need to calculate her annual savings.  Since she saves 20% of her annual salary, we can calculate this as follows:

* Annual savings = 0.20 * $100,000 = $20,000

Next, we need to determine her annual living expenses.  She plans to live on 40% of her salary, which is:

* Annual living expenses = 0.40 * $100,000 = $40,000

This leaves her with:

* Annual savings after living expenses = $100,000 - $40,000 = $60,000

To determine how long she needs to work, we need to consider her total savings goal.  She wants to save $1,200,000 over 20 years.  

Therefore, we can calculate the number of years she needs to work by dividing her total savings goal by her annual savings:

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline paint.
* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah paints.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

* We know that Arnold and Madeline paint the same number of eggs:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah paint a total of 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  The total number of eggs painted is 56: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**3. Solve for 'y':**

*  Simplify the second equation: 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
*  Solve for 'y': 2y = 44 - 2x
*  Therefore, y = 22 - x

**4. Solve for 'x':**

*  We know that x + x = 2x, so we can substitute the value of 'y' from the previous step: 2x + (2(22 - x) + 12) = 56
*  Simplify and solve for 'x': 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
*  This simplifies to 56 = 56, which is a true statement.  

**5. Solve for 'Camden's' eggs:**

*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12
*  Substitute the value of 'y' we found earlier: 22 - x + 12 = 22 - x + 12
*  Simplify: 34 - x = 22 - x + 12
*  This simplifies to 34 = 22 + 12, which is a true statement.

**6. Find the Difference:**

*  Camden painted 23 eggs and Arnold painted 11 eggs.
*  The difference is 23 - 11 = 12

**Answer:**  Camden painted 12 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break down the problem.  The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  We know the total number of passengers is 84.  

To find the number of women initially on the bus, we can set up a proportion:

*  (Men) / (Total passengers) = (Men's ratio) / (Total ratio parts)
*  (Men) / 84 = 5 / 14

Solving for the number of men:
*  Men = (5/14) * 84 = 30

Now, we can find the number of women:
*  (Women) / (Total passengers) = (Women's ratio) / (Total ratio parts)
*  (Women) / 84 = 9 / 14

Solving for the number of women:
*  Women = (9/14) * 84 = 54

Finally, we need to find the number of women remaining after 20 women alight:
*  Women remaining = 54 - 20 = 34

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let's use variables:**  Let's represent the number of seashells Carrey collected as 'x'.  
* **Formulate equations:** We know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2x seashells.  We also know that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.
* **Total seashells:** The total number of seashells is the sum of the individual collections: 2x + 2x + 5 + x = 60
* **Solve for x:** Combining like terms, we get 5x + 5 = 60. Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get 5x = 55. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 11.
* **Find the number of seashells each person collected:**
    * Carlos collected 2x = 2 * 11 = 22 seashells.
    * Jim collected 2x + 5 = 2 * 11 + 5 = 27 seashells.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Define variables:** Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* **Blue rope:** The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'x - 7'.
* **Red rope:** The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, meaning its length is '4(x - 7)'.
* **Total length:** The total length of all three ropes is 37 cm, so we can write the equation: x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

**Solve the equation:**

1. Combine like terms: x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. Simplify: 6x - 35 = 37
3. Add 35 to both sides: 6x = 72
4. Divide both sides by 6: x = 12

**Find the length of the red rope:**

* The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 cm

* Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
* Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

We are given two statements:

1. ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"" 
   This translates to: W = 5(C + 7)
2. ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""

**Solving the system of equations:**

We can solve for our two unknowns by substituting and simplifying.  

* **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

* **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)

"To calculate Jason's earnings, we need to consider the earnings for each task and then sum them up. 

* **Dishwasher:** Jason earns $0.50 per emptying, and he emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so his earnings from this task are $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.
* **Laundry:** Jason earns $3.00 per laundry, and he did his laundry once, so his earnings from this task are $3.00.
* **Trash:** Jason earns $0.75 per trash pickup, and he took the trash out twice, so his earnings from this task are $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
* **Cleaning:** Jason earns $1.50 per room cleaning, and he cleaned his room once, so his earnings from this task are $1.50.

Adding all these earnings together, Jason earned $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $8.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Day 1:** Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice that number of Lodgepole Pine, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.  The total number of trees planted on day 1 is 20 + 40 = 60 trees.

* **Day 2:** He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on day 1, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.  He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on day 1, so he planted (40 * 1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.  The total number of trees planted on day 2 is 30 + 10 = 40 trees.

* **Total Trees:**  The total number of trees planted in two days is 60 + 40 = 100 trees.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Red Stripes:**  We know one-third of the fish have red stripes, so 66 fish * (1/3) = 22 fish have red stripes.
* **Remaining Fish:**  The remaining fish are those that don't have red stripes, so there are 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish.
* **Blue Stripes:**  5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, meaning (5/11) * 44 fish = 20 fish have blue stripes.
* **Total:**  To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with each stripe: 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Low setting:** The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day at the low setting. Over 3 days, it removes 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.
* **Medium setting:** The medium setting removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 liter/day * 2 = 2 liters/day. Over 3 days, it removes 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.
* **High setting:** The high setting removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 liters/day * 2 = 4 liters/day. Over 5 days, it removes 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

To find the total amount of water removed, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 30 liters.


Therefore, the total amount of water removed is **30 liters**.

"Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the volume of the jar:**

* The jar is a square with sides of 6 inches, so its volume is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

**2. Calculate the volume of the jelly beans:**

* The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning the volume of jelly beans is 80% of the total volume of the jar.
* Volume of jelly beans = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

**3. Calculate the number of jelly beans:**

* The number of jelly beans is the volume of jelly beans divided by the volume per jelly bean.
* Number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

"The number of students in each grade level at Cedar Falls Middle School is 10.  Since there are 8 students allowed in each escape room group, the total number of groups is 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.  Each group has a 45-minute time limit.  Therefore, the total time required for all students to try the escape room is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, and Ian wants to cut it into two pieces.  The longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece.  

To find the length of the longer piece, we can use the following steps:

1. **Define variables:** Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.
2. **Define the longer piece:** The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4x.
3. **Set up an equation:** The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces: x + 4x = 40 feet.
4. **Solve for x:** Combine like terms: 5x = 40 feet. Divide both sides by 5 to find the value of x: x = 8 feet.
5. **Calculate the longer piece:** The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet.


**Answer: 32 feet**

"To determine the amount of seasoning needed, we need to consider the relationship between the number of meatballs and the amount of beef.  

* **Meatballs per pound:**  The problem states that Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of beef.
* **Total beef needed:**  He wants to make 80 meatballs, and each pound yields 16 meatballs, so he needs 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of beef.
* **Seasoning per pound:** The recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of beef.
* **Total seasoning:**  Therefore, he needs 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.


**Answer:** 10 tablespoons

"Luke needs to purchase fabric for five windows, each 35 inches wide.  He wants to buy fabric that is twice the total width of the windows.  To find the total fabric needed, we first calculate the total width of the windows: 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.  Then, we multiply this by 2 to find the total fabric needed: 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches.  Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric. 


**Answer:** 350 inches

"The cost of the call is determined by the time spent on the call.  The initial 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, so that's $0.25 * 16 = $4.00.  The remaining 20 minutes cost $0.20 per minute, so that's $0.20 * 20 = $4.00.  The total cost is $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00. 


**Answer:** $8.00

"Let's break down the problem:

* Monday's rainfall was 2 inches.
* Tuesday's rainfall is expected to be 1 inch more than twice Monday's rainfall.

To find Tuesday's rainfall, we can calculate:

* Twice Monday's rainfall: 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches
* One more than twice: 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches

Therefore, there will be **5 inches** of rain on Tuesday.

"Let's solve this problem systematically. 

Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.  Let 'b' represent the number of brownies she made. We know the following:

*  b = 3c - 2  (The number of brownies is 3 times the number of cupcakes minus 2)
*  The total number of treats is 10 (each person gets 2)
*  The class has 5 people.

We can express the total number of treats as: 5 * 2 = 10

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:

* b + c = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.

"Karen's total cost will be the price of the manicure and pedicure after the discount, plus the cost of the nail art. 

The discount on the manicure and pedicure is calculated as 20% of the original price, which is $35 * 0.20 = $7.  The total cost of the manicure and pedicure after the discount is $35 - $7 = $28.  

The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, and Karen wants nail art on all 10 of her nails, so the total cost of nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

Therefore, the total cost of the manicure, pedicure, and nail art is $28 + $30 = $58.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues per year.
* She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues per year.
* The last magazine sends 4 times the number of issues the 6-issue magazine sends.

To find the total number of magazines, we need to consider the number of issues from each magazine:

* 3 magazines * 12 issues/magazine = 36 issues
* 1 magazine * 6 issues/magazine = 6 issues
* The last magazine sends 4 * 6 issues = 24 issues.

Adding all the issues together: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 issues per year.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Define variables:** Let 'x' represent the number of paintings Kim has.

* **Formulate equations:** We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more than Kim.  This translates to the following equations:
    * Shelley = x + 8
    * Samantha = Shelley - 12 = (x + 8) - 12 = x - 4

* **Use the given information about Samantha:** We are told Samantha has 27 paintings.  Therefore:
    * x - 4 = 27

* **Solve for x:**  Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
    * x = 31

**Answer:** Kim has 31 paintings.

"The mean score is calculated by summing all the scores and then dividing by the total number of scores.  

The mean score is: 

**570 / 9 = 63.33** 
 
Let me know if you have any other calculations you'd like help with! 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* Eve started with 20 pomelos.
* She has 1/4 of her original amount remaining, meaning she has 20 pomelos / 4 = 5 pomelos left.
* To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the remaining pomelos from the original amount: 20 pomelos - 5 pomelos = 15 pomelos.

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. 


**Answer:** 15

"Let's break down the problem:

Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  We're told this represents 3/4 of the novels she's written this year.  To find the total number of novels she's written this year, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 3/4, equals 9.

* **Setting up the equation:**  Let 'x' represent the number of novels Regina has written this year. We can set up the equation: (3/4) * x = 9

* **Solving for x:**
    * Multiply both sides of the equation by 4/3: x = (9 * 4) / 3
    * Simplify: x = 12

**Answer:** Regina has written 12 novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to first calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days. 

Since Michael travels at a constant speed of 50 km/hr, we can calculate the distance he covers in 3 days as follows:

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 50 km/hr * 24 hr/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the total distance he has covered:

* Percentage = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100%
* Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"The problem states that Madeline ate 6 grapes and her brother used 5 times that amount, resulting in a total of 36 grapes used.  The problem then states that the mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.  Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.  The total number of grapes used is 36, and the mother used 48 grapes for the pies, so the total number of grapes used is 36 + 48 = 84.  The question asks for the number of grapes at the beginning, so the answer is 84.

"Bud's weekly macaroni and cheese expenses can be broken down as follows:

* **Pasta:** $1.00 per box
* **Cheddar Cheese:** $3.00
* **Gruyere Cheese:** $3.00 * 2 = $6.00
* **Total Cheese Cost:** $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

To calculate his annual cost, we need to consider the number of weeks in a year: 52 weeks.  Therefore, Bud spends $9.00/week * 52 weeks = $468.00 on cheese per year. 


**Answer:** $468.00

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we need to consider the capacity of each shelf and the total number of books she has. 

* **Bottom shelf:** Holds twice the capacity of a middle shelf, so it holds 20 books.
* **Top shelf:** Holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, meaning it holds 15 books.
* **Middle shelves:**  Hold 20 books each.
* **Total capacity:** The total capacity of all shelves is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.
* **Bookcases needed:**  To accommodate 110 books, Elly needs 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"To determine the number of calls Jason needs to make, we need to consider the conversion rate from calls to customers and the conversion rate from customers to sales. 

Let's break it down:

* **Conversion Rate:** Jason gets one customer for every 25 calls. This means he needs to make 15 cars / 1 customer/25 calls = 375 calls to convert 15 customers. 

* **Customer to Sale Conversion:** For every 2 customers who visit the dealership, one customer buys a car.  

* **Total Calls:** To reach 15 cars, Jason needs to make 15 cars / 2 customers/sale = 7.5 customers.  

* **Total Calls:** To convert 7.5 customers, Jason needs to make 7.5 customers * 25 calls/customer = 187.5 calls. 

**Therefore, Jason needs to make 188 calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Flashlights:**  Each person needs one flashlight, and there are 4 people, so they have a total of 4 flashlights.
* **Candles:**
    * Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 small candles.
    * The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so there are 4 rooms * 2 candles/room = 8 medium candles.
    * Total candles: 8 small candles + 8 medium candles = 16 candles.
* **Total:** They have 4 flashlights + 16 candles = 20 items in total.

Therefore, Brianna's family is using 20 items in total.

"To determine the total cost, we need to consider the number of boxes needed and the price per box.  

First, we need to determine the number of boxes required to obtain 56 popsicle sticks.  Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we can divide the total popsicle sticks by the sticks per box: 56 sticks / 8 sticks/box = 7 boxes.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost.  The cost per box is $2.00, and we need 7 boxes, so the total cost is 7 boxes * $2.00/box = $14.00.


**Answer:** $14.00 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Cost of the main phone:**  The problem states the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.  
* **Cost of additional phones:** Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, we can represent the cost of each additional phone as 'x'.  Therefore, the cost of the main phone is 2x.
* **Total cost:** The total cost of the plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones. 

We know the total cost of the plan is $20.  Let's set up an equation:

2x + 4x = $20

Combining like terms:

6x = $20

Solving for x:

x = $20 / 6

x = $3.33 (approximately)

Now, we can find the cost of the main phone:

2 * $3.33 = $6.66

Finally, the total cost of the plan is:

$6.66 + $3.33 = $10.00

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Day 1:** Conor observes 50 people.
* **Day 2:** The number of people increases by 20 from Day 1, so there are 50 + 20 = 70 people.
* **Day 3:** The number of people triples from Day 2, resulting in 70 * 3 = 210 people.
* **Total for the first three days:** 50 + 70 + 210 = 330 people.
* **The remaining days:** Conor sees an average of 60 people per day for the remaining 5 days.
* **Total for the rest of the week:** 60 people/day * 5 days = 300 people.
* **Total for the week:** 330 + 300 = 630 people.

**Answer:** 630

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Initial Popping:** The popcorn starts with 20 kernels popping in the first 30 seconds.
* **Increased Popping:** The rate increases three times, so in the next 30 seconds, 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.
* **Further Increase:** The rate increases again, four times the initial rate, resulting in 60 * 4 = 240 kernels popping in the next 30 seconds.
* **Final Popping:** The rate slows down to half the previous rate, so in the final 30 seconds, 240 / 2 = 120 kernels pop.
* **Residual Heat:**  After the pan is removed, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds, or 120 / 4 = 30 kernels, pop from residual heat.

**Total Popping:**  The total number of kernels popped is 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = 440 kernels.


**Answer:** Garrett has 440 kernels to eat.

"To determine the total dog food consumption for the week, we need to consider the daily food intake of each breed and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. 

* **German Shepherds:** 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg
* **Bulldogs:** 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg
* **Total weekly consumption:** 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Therefore, they will need 21 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"The total number of legs on the farm is the sum of the legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.  

* 2-legged animals contribute 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs.
* 4-legged animals contribute 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs.
* Therefore, the total number of legs is 20 + 60 = 80. 


**Answer:** 80

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of red blocks.**

* **Blue and yellow blocks:** The tower has 4 blue blocks, and twice as many yellow blocks, so there are 4 + 2(x) = 4 + 2x blue and yellow blocks.

* **Total blocks:** The total number of blocks is 4 + 2x + x = 4 + 3x.

* **Equation:** We know the total number of blocks is 32, so we can set up an equation: 4 + 3x = 32

* **Solve for x:**  Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 28. Divide both sides by 3: x = 9.33.

* **Red blocks:** Since we can't have a fraction of a block, we need to adjust our thinking.  The problem likely intended for the number of red blocks to be a whole number. 


**Answer:**  There are **20** red blocks.

"To determine Elvis's current distance from his house, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the time spent on each leg of the journey. 

* **Westward Journey:** Elvis travels for 5 hours at a speed of 18 mph, covering a distance of 18 mph * 5 hours = 90 miles.
* **Eastward Journey:** He then travels for 8 hours at the same speed, covering 18 mph * 8 hours = 144 miles.
* **Total Distance:** The total distance traveled is 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is **234 miles** from his house.

"The boat depreciates by a cumulative 60% over the three years.  

Here's how to calculate the value after each year:

* **Year 1:**  $9000 * 0.30 = $2700 depreciation.  The boat is now worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.
* **Year 2:**  $6300 * 0.30 = $1890 depreciation. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.
* **Year 3:** $4410 * 0.20 = $882 depreciation. The boat is now worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"To determine the number of pink candies, we need to first calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies.  We know there are 54 red candies.  The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so there are 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies.  The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so there are 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.  

The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  

Finally, we can find the number of pink candies by subtracting the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag: 232 - 189 = 43. 


**Answer:** 43

"Let's break down the cost of Helen's trip. 

* **Hotel cost:**  She stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at a cost of $80 per night, so the total hotel cost is $80 * 3 = $240.
* **Bus fare:** Each bus trip cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8.  She took 7 bus trips, so the total bus fare is $8 * 7 = $56.
* **Total cost:** The total cost of the trip is the sum of the hotel and bus costs: $240 + $56 = $296.

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for her trip.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4. 
* This means he had 25 marbles before dropping any.
* To find out how many Mazie gave to Darla, we need to find the difference between the total number of marbles Mazie had and the number Dallas had. 
* Therefore, Mazie gave Darla 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

"The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight.  Therefore, we need to calculate 1% of the total weight of the car and its occupants. 

The total weight is 1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + (2 * 75 pounds) = 1600 pounds.

The force required is then 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds. 


**Answer:** 16 pounds

"To determine the total length of crepe paper James needs, we first need to find the perimeter of his rectangular fence.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.  Substituting these values into the formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) 
Perimeter = 2 * 35 feet
Perimeter = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we first need to determine Emma's age.  Since Mia is younger than Emma and the age difference is 16 years, we can calculate Emma's age as 40 + 16 = 56 years.  

The average of their ages is then (40 + 56) / 2 = 48.

"To determine the cost of the hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs John needs to purchase.  He's hosting 20 guests and each guest will consume 2 hot dogs, so he'll need 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4 leftover, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more.  Finally, we need to figure out the cost per pack. A pack contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2, so he'll need to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs.  The total cost is then 6 * $2 = $12. 


**Answer:** $12

"To determine Frances's remaining funds, we need to calculate her earnings from each item and then sum them. 

* **Cupcakes:** She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, resulting in 20 * $2 = $40 in earnings.
* **Cookies:** She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, generating 40 * $1 = $40 in earnings.
* **Trays:** She purchases 5 trays at $4 each, costing 5 * $4 = $20.

Finally, we sum her earnings from all sources: $40 + $40 + $20 = $100. 

Therefore, Frances has $100 left.

"To determine the total value of James' change, we need to convert each coin denomination to cents. 

* A quarter is worth 25 cents.
* Two nickels are worth 2 * 5 = 10 cents.
* Seven dimes are worth 7 * 10 = 70 cents.

Adding these values together, we get 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents. 

Therefore, James has 105 cents in change.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Identify the relevant information:** We have a family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters.  The sisters are all the same age, and one brother is 12 years old.
* **Determine the age of the sisters:** Since all the sisters are the same age, we know they are 16 years old.
* **Calculate the age of the older brother:** The brother is half the age of the older brother, meaning the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.
* **Calculate the total age of all siblings:** The total age of all siblings is 24 + 16 * 3 = 60 years.

"Here's how to calculate Charisma's total time:

* **Meditation:** She meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, so that's 15 minutes * 2 = 30 minutes per day.
* **Weekly Meditation:** Over 5 days, she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 5 days = 150 minutes.
* **Yoga:** She practices yoga for 1 hour per day, which is 60 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.
* **Total Time:**  Her total time is 150 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 450 minutes.
* **Over 4 Weeks:**  Over 4 weeks, she'll have spent 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes.

"The quilt's area is calculated by summing the areas of each shirt type.  

* Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
* Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Adding these together: 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet. 

Therefore, the quilt's total area is 101 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Anne's height:** We know Anne is twice the height of Albert, who is 36 inches tall. Therefore, Anne is 2 * 36 = 72 inches tall.
* **Jackie's height after summer:**  Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so she is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, who is 72 inches tall. This means Jackie is 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall.
* **Jackie's height before summer:**  To find Jackie's height before summer, we subtract the 3 inches she gained during the summer from her current height: 70 inches - 3 inches = 67 inches.

**Answer:** 67 inches

"To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to consider his total funds and the cost of each ticket. 

First, we know Ryan earns $18 from his chores over three weeks.  Then, he spends $3.75 on ice cream for himself and three friends.  

Next, we need to calculate how much money is left after the ice cream purchase.  This is $21.75 (total funds) - $3.75 (ice cream cost).

Finally, we can divide the remaining funds by the cost of each ticket to find out how many tickets he can buy.  

$21.75 / $6.50/ticket = 3.3 tickets. 

Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy **3** movie tickets. 



"
"To find the total cost, we need to consider the individual purchases made by Ellen and Lani. 

* Ellen's expenses: $100 (leggings) + $5 (photo frame) = $105
* Lani's expenses: $30 (sunglasses) + (2 * $100) (bathrobes) = $30 + $200 = $230

Finally, we sum their individual expenses: $105 + $230 = $335

Therefore, the total cost for their shopping trip is $335.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Cookies:** Randy begins with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, totaling 18 cookies.

2. **Snack:** He consumes 3 cookies in total (3 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, 3 sugar). This leaves him with 18 - 9 = 9 cookies.

3. **Lunch:** He eats 2 oatmeal cookies, reducing his count to 9 - 2 = 7 cookies.

4. **Giving Cookies:** He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with 7 - 2 = 5 cookies.

5. **Dinner Baking:** He bakes 4 of each flavor, resulting in 11 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 3 sugar cookies.

**Final Count:**  Randy has 5 + 11 + 3 = 19 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
    * Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered.

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    * We know he gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: p = 14 + 2 = 16
    * We know the total number of items is 29: t + p + beakers = 29

* **Solve for the number of beakers:**
    * We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 + 16 + beakers = 29
    * Simplify: 24 + beakers = 29
    * Subtract 24 from both sides: beakers = 5

* **Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers. 


**Therefore, Igor lost 5 beakers.**

"The caretaker needs to buy 606 feet of line.  Here's how to solve it:

* **Calculate the total line needed:** The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and he has 200 feet of dock. So, the total line needed is 200 feet * 3 feet/foot = 600 feet.
* **Add the existing line:** He already has 6 feet of line.  Therefore, he needs to buy 600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet more.


**Answer:** 594

"Let's break down the problem:

* **James's age:** We know James is twice Dora's age, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years.  Therefore, Dora is currently 12 years old. James is twice her age, so he is 12 * 2 = 24 years old.
* **John's age:**  We know James was born when John was 19.  Therefore, John is currently 32 + 19 = 51 years old.
* **The youngest son's age:** The youngest son was born when John was 32.  In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.


**Answer:** 35

"The problem asks for the difference in oranges peeled by Ana and Jane after an hour.  

To determine this, we need to consider the rate at which each person peels oranges.  

* Ana peels 1 orange per 3 minutes.
* Jane peels 1 orange per 4 minutes.

Since they start peeling at the same time, the key is to compare the number of oranges peeled by each person in an hour. 

* Ana peels 60 oranges in an hour (60 minutes).
* Jane peels 60 oranges in an hour (60 minutes).

Therefore, the difference in oranges peeled is 0. 



**Answer:** 0

"Here's how to calculate the total cost:

1. **Discount:** The radiator is discounted by 80%, meaning Mark pays 20% of the original price ($400 * 0.20 = $80).

2. **Price after discount:** The discounted price is $400 - $80 = $320.

3. **Labor cost:** The mechanic charges $50 per hour and the installation takes 3 hours, so the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

4. **Total cost:** The total cost is the sum of the discounted price and the labor cost: $320 + $150 = $470.

**Therefore, Mark paid $470 for the new radiator and installation.**

"To determine the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

The total number of slices is 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices. 

There are 4 people sharing the pizzas. Therefore, each person can have 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices.
