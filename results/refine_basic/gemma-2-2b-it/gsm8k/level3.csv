"Josh's investment in the house is a bit of a mixed bag.  Here's how to break down the situation:

* **Initial Investment:** The house cost Josh $80,000.
* **Repairs:** He invested an additional $50,000 in repairs.
* **Value Increase:** The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.  This means the house is now worth 1.5 times its original price.

**Calculating the Profit:**

To determine Josh's profit, we need to find the difference between the value of the house after repairs and the initial investment. 

* **Value After Repairs:** $80,000 (original price) + $120,000 (150% increase) = $200,000
* **Profit:** $200,000 (value after repairs) - $130,000 (initial investment) = $70,000

**Therefore, Josh's profit is $70,000.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Total feed given:** Wendi gives her chickens a total of 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, totaling 15 + 25 = 40 cups.
* **Feed per chicken per day:**  Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day.
* **Total feed needed:** To find the total feed needed for all chickens, we divide the total feed given by the number of chickens: 40 cups / 20 chickens = 2 cups per chicken.
* **Final meal:**  Since each chicken needs 2 cups per day, the final meal will provide 2 cups per chicken * 20 chickens = 40 cups.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Seattle's sheep:** We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
* **Charleston's sheep:** Charleston has 4 times the sheep of Seattle, so it has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
* **Toulouse's sheep:** Toulouse has twice the sheep of Charleston, meaning it has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
* **Total sheep:** To find the total, we add the sheep from each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 260 sheep.

"Let's break down the download process.  

First, we need to calculate the time spent downloading the initial 80 GB.  This is simply the initial download time, which is 40 minutes.

Then, we need to account for the restart.  The restart takes 20 minutes.

Finally, we need to calculate the remaining download time.  The remaining download is 120 GB.  This is the total download size minus the already downloaded portion.  

The remaining download time is 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Therefore, the total download time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes. 


**Answer: 120 minutes**

"Let's break down the problem to find the distance John travels.

**Step 1:  Initial Trip**

* John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, covering a distance of 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.

**Step 2: Traffic Delay**

* He encounters traffic for 2 hours at a speed of 0 mph, meaning he doesn't move any distance during this time.

**Step 3:  The Final Stretch**

* John drives for 4 hours at 80 mph, covering a distance of 80 mph * 4 hours = 320 miles.

**Step 4:  Calculating the Total Distance**

* To find the total distance, we need to consider the initial 180 miles, the 30 miles spent in traffic, and the 320 miles of the final drive. 

**Step 5:  The Answer**

* The total distance John travels is 180 miles + 30 miles + 320 miles = 530 miles.

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular pay and overtime pay. 

* **Regular pay:** Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works.  
* **Overtime:**  She works 5 additional hours, which is considered overtime.  Overtime pay is calculated as 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.

**Here's how to break it down:**

* **Regular pay:** 40 hours * $10/hour = $400
* **Overtime pay:** 5 hours * $10/hour * 1.2 = $60
* **Total earnings:** $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460.

"To determine the break-even point for Carlos' lemon tree, we need to find the number of years it takes for his annual profit to exceed his annual expenses.  

Let's represent the number of years as 'x'.  

* **Profit per year:**  The profit Carlos makes is $10.50 (earnings) - $3.00 (expenses) = $7.50.
* **Total profit over 'x' years:**  The total profit over 'x' years is 7.50 * x.

We want to find the value of 'x' when the total profit is greater than the total expenses.  

**Setting up the inequality:**

The break-even point occurs when the total profit is equal to the total expenses.  Therefore, we need to find the value of 'x' when the total profit is greater than the total expenses.

**Solving the inequality:**

We want to find the value of 'x' when the total profit is greater than the total expenses.  

* **Total profit over 'x' years:** 7.50 * x
* **Total expenses:** 3.00 * x

Setting the total profit greater than the total expenses:

7.50 * x > 3.00 * x

**Solving for x:**

* 7.50x - 3.00x > 0
* 4.50x > 0
* x > 0

**Answer:** Carlos will start earning money on his lemon tree after the first year.

"Let's break this problem down systematically.  We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  This means she sold a total of 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before she had any left. 

Let's use a variable to represent the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with.  We can represent this as ""x"".

We know that she sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is represented as 1/3 * x.  

We also know that she sold 2 more at the red house than at the green house, which is represented as 1/3 + 2.

Finally, we know that she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is represented as 1/2 * (x - (1/3 * x - 2)).

We can now set up an equation to represent the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:

1/3 * x + (1/3 + 2) + 1/2 * (x - (1/3 * x - 2)) = 10

Solving for x, we get:

1/3 * x + 1/3 + 2 + 1/2 * x - 1/6 * x + 1 = 10

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let 's represent the number of silver coins.  Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver, we can represent the number of gold coins as 's + 30'.  

We know the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Now, let's solve for 's':

1. Combine like terms: 2s + 30 = 110
2. Subtract 30 from both sides: 2s = 80
3. Divide both sides by 2: s = 40

Since 's' represents the number of silver coins, we know Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the number of gold coins, we use the equation: s + 30

Therefore, Gretchen has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.


**Answer: Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'r' represent Dana's running speed in miles per hour.
* Let 'w' represent Dana's walking speed in miles per hour.

We know the following:

*  r = 4w  (Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed)
*  w = 3  (Dana's walking speed is 3 miles per hour)

We are given that Dana travels for 6 hours.  We can use this information to set up a system of equations:

* **Time spent running:**  2 hours
* **Time spent walking:** 4 hours

**Distance traveled during running:** 
* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance running = r * 2 = 4w * 2 = 8w

**Distance traveled during walking:**
* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance walking = w * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12

**Total distance:**
* Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking
* Total distance = 8w + 12

**Substituting the value of 'w' from the first equation:**

"Let's break this down.  We know Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet with the gemstone, and that's her starting point.  But when she holds the gemstone, she can throw it 3 times farther.  To find the maximum distance she can throw it, we need to add the extra distance.  

The extra distance is 3 times the original distance, which is 3 * 400 feet = 1200 feet.  

Now, to find the total distance, we add the extra distance to the original distance: 400 feet + 1200 feet = 1600 feet. 

Therefore, Polly can stand 1600 feet away from the dragon to hit it.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Calories per serving:** The bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
* **Total calories in the bag:** A 300g bag contains 5 servings.
* **Daily calorie target:** You need to consume 2000 calories.
* **Calories already consumed:** You've already eaten 1800 calories.

**To figure out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to consider the following:**

1. **Calculate the total calories from the chips:** 
   * 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

2. **Determine the remaining calories:**
   * 2000 calories (target) - 1800 calories (consumed) = 200 calories

3. **Calculate the number of servings you can have:**
   * 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings

4. **Convert servings to grams:**
   * 0.8 servings * 250 grams/serving = 200 grams


**Therefore, you can eat 200 grams of chips.**

"Let's break down Charlie's candle business.

**1. Cost per candle:**

* He uses 1 pound of beeswax to make 10 candles.
* The cost per pound of beeswax is $10.00.
* Therefore, the cost per candle is $10.00 / 10 candles = $1.00 per candle.

**2. Total Revenue:**

* He sells each candle for $2.00.
* He makes 20 candles.
* His total revenue is 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

**3. Profit:**

* His total cost is $20.00 (for the beeswax and wicks).
* His total revenue is $40.00.
* His profit is $40.00 (revenue) - $20.00 (cost) = $20.00

**Therefore, Charlie's net profit is $20.00.**

"Let's break down this problem using a simple equation. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased.

We know:

* Candice started with 80 notes (let's call this 'initial notes').
* She used 220 notes at work (let's call this 'notes used').
* She has 23 notes remaining (let's call this 'remaining notes').

We can express this information as an equation:

Initial notes + notes purchased = total notes

80 + x = total notes

We also know that the total notes used is the sum of the initial notes and the remaining notes:

total notes = notes used + remaining notes

80 + x = 220 + 23

Now we can solve for 'x':

80 + x = 243

Subtract 80 from both sides:

x = 163

**Answer:** Candice purchased 163 Post-it notes.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'b' represent the cost of one blue tie.
* Let 'r' represent the cost of one red tie.

We know:

*  r = 1.5b (Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties)
*  b + 2r = 200 (Total cost of blue ties)

Now, let's solve for 'b' in the second equation:

* b + 2r = 200
* b + 2(1.5b) = 200
* b + 3b = 200
* 4b = 200
* b = 50

Now that we know the cost of one blue tie (b = $50), we can find the cost of one red tie:

* r = 1.5b
* r = 1.5 * 50
* r = 75

Finally, calculate the total cost of all ties:

* Total cost = 50 (blue ties) * $40 + 75 (red ties) * $60
* Total cost = $2000 + $4500
* Total cost = $6500

"To find the number of unoccupied units, we first need to determine the total number of units in the building.  Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Next, we need to calculate the proportion of occupied units.  We are given that 3/4 of the building is occupied.  This means that 3/4 * 120 = 90 units are occupied.

Finally, we can find the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to reach his goal of 15 pounds.  

**Key Information:**

* Comic books weigh 1/4 of a pound each.
* Toys weigh 1/2 of a pound each.
* Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the weight of the comic books:**  He removes 30 comic books, and each weighs 1/4 pound, so the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of the toys:**  We know he needs to remove 15 pounds total, and we've already accounted for the comic books (7.5 pounds).  Therefore, the weight of the toys is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of toys:**  Each toy weighs 1/2 a pound, and he needs to remove 7.5 pounds of toys.  So, he needs to remove 7.5 / (1/2) = 15 toys.


**Answer:** Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"Let's break down the cost of Stephen's groceries.  

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the groceries before any fees are added.  We know the final bill was $40.00.

Next, we need to consider the 25% delivery fee.  To find this, we multiply the original price by 0.25: $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00.

Then, we add the delivery fee to the original price: $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

Finally, we need to add the $4.00 tip to the total cost: $50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00.

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $54.00.

"Let's break down the calculation of Shiela's monthly installment payments.

**Understanding the Components**

* **Principal:** The initial cost of the cell phones, which is $750.
* **Interest Rate:** The interest charged per unit is 2%, which means for each phone, the interest is 0.02 * $150 = $3.
* **Time:** The installment period is 3 months.

**Calculating the Monthly Payment**

To find the monthly payment, we need to consider the interest accrued over the 3-month period.  

**The Formula**

The formula for calculating the monthly payment for an installment loan is:

Monthly Payment = (Principal + Interest) / (1 - (1 + Interest Rate)^-Number of Months)

**Applying the Formula**

* Principal: $750
* Interest Rate: 2% or 0.02
* Number of Months: 3

Monthly Payment = ($750 + (0.02 * $750) * 3) / (1 - (1 + 0.02)^-3)

**Calculating the Result**

After performing the calculation, the monthly payment for Shiela is $765.

"The problem can be solved using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.  

The first term is 16, and the common ratio is 1/2.  The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
* S is the sum of the series
* a is the first term
* r is the common ratio
* n is the number of terms

In this case, we have:

* a = 16
* r = 1/2
* n = 4

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

S = 16 (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 15

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 15.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **First phase:** The puppy needs 1 cup of food per day for the first 180 days.  This is a straightforward calculation: 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.
* **Second phase:**  The puppy's food needs change after the initial 180 days. We need to figure out how many cups of food the puppy will need for the rest of its life.  Since we don't know the puppy's lifespan, we'll assume it lives for a year.  
* **Calculating the total food needed:** The puppy will need 2 cups of food per day for the rest of its life, and we know it will live for a year.  So, we need to calculate the total cups needed for a year: 365 days * 2 cups/day = 730 cups.
* **Total food needed:**  The puppy needs 180 cups in the first phase and 730 cups in the second phase.  Therefore, the total food needed is 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.
* **Bags needed:**  We know that each bag contains 110 cups.  To find out how many bags are needed, we divide the total cups needed by the cups per bag: 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8.27 bags.

**Answer:** Cecilia will need 8.27 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Let's break down this problem using a simple ratio approach.

* **Let's represent the amount of laundry David does as 'x'.** 
* **Sarah does 4 times the amount David does, so her laundry is 4x.**
* **Raymond does half the amount Sarah does, so his laundry is (1/2) * 4x = 2x.**

Now we know:

* David's laundry: x pounds
* Sarah's laundry: 4x pounds
* Raymond's laundry: 2x pounds

To find the difference, we subtract Raymond's laundry from Sarah's laundry:

**Sarah's laundry - Raymond's laundry = 4x - 2x = 2x**

We know Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so we can substitute that into the equation:

**400 pounds = 2x**

Solving for x:

**x = 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds**

Now we can find the difference:

**Sarah's laundry - Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds - 200 pounds = 200 pounds**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem**

We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's time.  This means we can represent Gerald's original time as 'x' and Lee's time as 'x + 2'.  We also know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%.  

**Setting up the Equation**

We are given that Lee's time is 38 seconds.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

**Solving for x**

To find Gerald's original time, we need to solve for 'x'.  Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

x = 36

**Calculating Gerald's New Time**

Now that we know Gerald's original time (x = 36), we can calculate his new time after his diet change.  Since his diet improved his speed by 10%, we can represent this as 1.10x.

Gerald's new time is: 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'd' represent the number of dogs.
* Let 'c' represent the number of cats.
* Let 'r' represent the number of rabbits.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1.  r = d + c - 12  (The number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats)
2.  c = 2d  (There are two cats for every dog)

Now, we can use the second equation to substitute the value of 'c' in the first equation:

1.  r = d + (2d) - 12
2.  r = 3d - 12

We also know that the total number of pets is 348.  We can express this as:

3.  d + c + r = 348

Substitute the value of 'c' from the second equation into the third equation:

4.  d + 2d + (3d - 12) = 348

Simplify and solve for 'd':

5.  6d - 12 = 348
6.  6d = 360
7.  d = 60

Now that we know the number of dogs ('d'), we can find the number of cats and rabbits:

*  c = 2d = 2 * 60 = 120
*  r = 3d - 12 = 3 * 60 - 12 = 168

Finally, calculate the total number of pets:

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the total distance Julia rowed.
* Let 'y' represent the total amount of water the boat took on.

**2. Set up the Proportion:**

We know the boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.  This translates to a proportion:

"Let's break down this salary problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were earning four years later.  We know:

* Adrien's salary increased by 40% over four years.
* Lylah's salary also increased, but we need to figure out the exact amount.

**Key Concepts**

* **Percentage Increase:**  A percentage increase means we need to find the amount by which a value has increased as a fraction of the original value.
* **Combined Increase:**  We need to consider the individual increases of both Adrien and Lylah to find their combined increase.

**Solution**

1. **Adrien's Salary:**  We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.  Let's represent his salary now as 'x'.  We know his salary increased by 40% of his original salary, so:
   * x = 40,000 * 1.40 

2. **Lylah's Salary:**  We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.  Let's represent Lylah's salary four years ago as 'y'.  We can set up an equation:
   * 40,000 = y * 1.30

3. **Solving for y:**  We can solve for y by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.30:
   * y = 40,000 / 1.30 
   * y = 30,77 (approximately)

4. **Lylah's Salary Now:**  We can calculate Lylah's salary now by adding the increase to her salary four years ago:
   * Lylah's salary now = 30,77 * 1.40 
   * Lylah's salary now = 4300 (approximately)

5. **Total Salary:**  Finally, we can calculate the total salary by adding Adrien's and Lylah's salaries:
   * Total salary = Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now
   * Total salary = 56,000 + 4300
   * Total salary = 60,300


**Answer:** The total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  *w* represent the cost of a watermelon
*  *p* represent the cost of a pepper
*  *o* represent the cost of an orange

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

*  w = 3p  (Watermelon cost is three times the pepper cost)
*  o = w - 5 (Orange cost is 5 less than the watermelon cost)

We also know:

*  4w + 20p + 10o = total cost 

Now, let's substitute the expressions for *w* and *o* from the first two equations into the third equation:

* 4(3p) + 20p + 10(w - 5) = total cost

Simplify and solve for *p*:

* 12p + 20p + 10w - 50 = total cost
* 32p + 10w - 50 = total cost
* 32p + 10(3p) - 50 = total cost  (Substitute w = 3p)
* 32p + 30p - 50 = total cost
* 62p - 50 = total cost

We need to find the value of *p* to determine the total cost.  We know that each pepper costs $15.  

* 62p - 50 = 15 * 20 
* 62p - 50 = 300
* 62p = 350
* p = 350 / 62
* p = 5.69 (approximately)

Now that we know the value of *p*, we can calculate the total cost:

* 62p - 50 = total cost
* 62(5.69) - 50 = total cost
* 35.918 - 50 = total cost
* 35.918 - 50 = -14.082

 

**Answer:** The total cost is approximately -14.082.

"Let's break this problem down step-by-step.  We know the final count is 5 fries.  We also know that the ants took one fry, leaving 7 fries.  This means that the number of fries remaining after the ants took one is 7 - 1 = 6.  We also know that the raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 6 = 4.  This means that the number of fries remaining after the raccoon took some is 6 - 4 = 2.  We also know that the seagull ate half of the fries that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7.  This means that the number of fries that the seagull ate is 7.  We also know that the pigeons ate 3 fries each, which is 3 * 3 = 9.  This means that the number of fries that the pigeons ate is 9.  We also know that Dave ate 14 fries, which is 14.  This means that the number of fries that Dave ate is 14.

"The price of the bag of marbles increases by a compound interest rate of 20% every two months.  To calculate the final price after 36 months, we need to consider the compounding effect. 

Here's how to break it down:

* **Initial Price:** $20
* **Compounding Period:** 2 months
* **Interest Rate:** 20% per compounding period

**Formula:**

The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year
* t = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed for

**Applying the Formula:**

1. **Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate:** 20% / 12 = 1.67%
2. **Calculate the number of compounding periods:** 36 months / 2 months/period = 18 periods
3. **Plug the values into the formula:**

A = 20 (1 + 0.167)^18

**Calculating the Final Price:**

A = 20 (1.167)^18 
A ≈ $164.00


 
**Therefore, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $164.00.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step using variables to represent the number of crabs each person has.

* Let 'B' represent the number of crabs Bo has.
* Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 'B - 4' crabs.
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 'B - 4 + 10' crabs.

Now we can express the total number of crabs as:

Total crabs = B + (B - 4) + (B - 4 + 10)

Simplifying the equation:

Total crabs = 3B + 2

We know that Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40.  Substituting this into the equation:

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'J' represent Jean's current age.
* Let 'M' represent Mark's current age.

We are given the following information:

*  J = M + 2  (Jean is two years older than Mark)
*  M - 2 = (1/2)J  (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age)

Now we can solve for J.

**Step 1: Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**

Since we know J = M + 2, we can substitute this into the second equation:

(M - 2) = (1/2)(M + 2)

**Step 2: Solve for M:**

* Multiply both sides by 2: 2M - 4 = M + 2
* Subtract M from both sides: M - 4 = 2

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30, so the combined cost is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.  Therefore, the cost of one pen is $1.50.  Finally, we multiply the cost of one pen by the desired quantity, which is 8.  This gives us $1.50 * 8 = $12.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Month 1:** Elaine starts with 20 cards and adds 3 times that amount, so she has 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
* **Month 2:** She then collects 20 fewer cards than in month 1, meaning she has 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
* **Month 1 & 2 combined:**  The total number of cards from month 1 and 2 is 60 + 40 = 100 cards.
* **Month 3:**  In month 3, Elaine collects twice the number from months 1 and 2, so she has 100 * 2 = 200 cards.
* **Total:**  Finally, we add all the cards together: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.


**Answer:** 320

"Let's break down the problem using variables. 

* Let 'x' represent the rate per sentence paid by Publisher A.
* Since Publisher B pays twice the rate of Publisher A, their rate is 2x.
* Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.
* His earnings from Publisher A are 1000 * x cents.
* His earnings from Publisher B are 1000 * 2x cents.
* The total earnings are the sum of these two amounts: 1000x + 1000 * 2x = 15000

Now, we can simplify and solve for 'x':

1000x + 2000x = 15000
3000x = 15000
x = 15000 / 3000
x = 5

Therefore, Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider the impact of the lowest score being removed from the average.  

Let's represent the scores as follows:

*  x = Brinley's score on the sixth test

We know the following:

* The sum of the first five tests is 448.
* The desired average is 93.
* The lowest score is removed from the average.

We can set up an equation to represent the weighted average:

(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x) / 6 = 93

Simplifying the equation:

(448 + x) / 6 = 93

Multiply both sides by 6:

448 + x = 558

Subtract 448 from both sides:

x = 110

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of **110** on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of one cup.**

* **The cost of twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.**

* **The total cost of the cups is 240x.**

* **The cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.**

* **We know the total cost of the cups is $34800 less than the cost of half a dozen plates, so we can set up an equation:** 240x = $36000 - $1200

* **Solving for x:** 
   * 240x = $34800
   * x = $34800 / 240
   * x = $145

**Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step to find the solution.

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'm' represent the number of lawn mowing sessions Sara completes.
* Let 'b' represent the number of babysitting sessions Sara completes.
* Let 'j' represent the total amount of money Sara has.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* We know that Sara has $10 saved initially.
* Her earnings from babysitting are represented by 'b * $5'
* Her earnings from mowing the lawn are represented by 'm * $4'
* The total amount of money Sara has is the sum of her savings and earnings: j = $10 + (b * $5) + (m * $4)

**3. Solve for the Number of Lawn Mowing Sessions:**

* We want to find the value of 'm' (number of lawn mowings) that will allow Sara to have enough money for the jacket and shoes.
* We know the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $70.
* We also know that Sara needs to earn $60 more to reach her goal.

**4.  Determine the Number of Lawn Mowing Sessions:**

*  We can set up an equation to represent the total amount of money Sara needs to earn: 
   *  $70 (jacket and shoes) + $10 (initial savings) = $80
*  We can then solve for the number of lawn mowings needed:
   *  $80 = (b * $5) + (m * $4)
   *  $80 = 5b + 4m
   *  We need to find the value of 'm' that satisfies this equation.

**5.  Solve for 'm':**

*  We can use trial and error or a more systematic approach to find the value of 'm'. 
*  We know that Sara needs to earn $60 more to reach her goal. 
*  We can use this information to find the value of 'm'.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a system of equations. 

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

We know the following:

*  The total number of chickens is the sum of red and white chickens:  r + w = total chickens
*  The number of eggs produced by red and white chickens is 42: 3r + 5w = 42

**3. Solve for 'r' (the number of red chickens):**

* We can solve for 'w' in terms of 'r' using the first equation: r = total chickens - w
* Substitute this value of 'r' into the second equation: 3(total chickens - w) + 5w = 42
* Simplify and solve for 'w': 3(total chickens - w) + 5w = 42
*  Expand: 3total chickens - 3w + 5w = 42
* Combine like terms: 3total chickens + 2w = 42
*  Since we know the total number of chickens is a constant, we can substitute the value of 'total chickens' from the first equation. 

**4.  Final Answer:**

To get the final numerical answer, we need to know the total number of chickens.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to consider the perimeter of the park.  

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Therefore:

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 15 miles and the speed is 3 miles per hour.  

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

"Let's break down this problem using a system of differential equations. 

**Modeling the Problem**

We can model the rate of change of water in each pool as a differential equation.  

* **Let:**
    *  *y<sub>1</sub>* represent the amount of water in the big pool.
    *  *y<sub>2</sub>* represent the amount of water in the small pool.

* **Rate of change:**
    * The rate of water loss in the big pool is -4 gallons/minute.
    * The rate of water loss in the small pool is also -4 gallons/minute.

* **Differential equations:**
    *  *dy<sub>1</sub>/dt = -4*
    *  *dy<sub>2</sub>/dt = -4*

**Solving the System**

We can solve this system of differential equations using separation of variables. 

1. **Separate variables:**
   *  *dy<sub>1</sub>/dt = -4*
   *  *dy<sub>2</sub>/dt = -4*

2. **Integrate both sides:**
   *  *∫dy<sub>1</sub> = -4t + C<sub>1</sub>*
   *  *∫dy<sub>2</sub> = -4t + C<sub>2</sub>*

3. **Solve for y<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>2</sub>:**
   *  *y<sub>1</sub> = -4t + C<sub>1</sub>*
   *  *y<sub>2</sub> = -4t + C<sub>2</sub>*

4. **Initial conditions:**
   *  We are given that the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago. This means that *y<sub>1</sub>(0) = 2y<sub>2</sub>(0)*. 
   *  We are also given that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool now. This means that *y<sub>1</sub>(4) = 4y<sub>2</sub>(4)*.

5. **Solve for the constants C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>:**
   *  We can use the initial conditions to solve for the constants C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. 

**Final Answer:**

The final numerical answer will be the solution to the system of differential equations.

"Let's break down this age problem step-by-step.

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let Adrian's current age be represented by 'a'
*  Let Harriet's current age be represented by 'h'
*  Let Zack's current age be represented by 'z'

**Formulate equations based on the given information:**

*  We know that ""Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet""  which translates to:  a = 3h
*  We also know that ""Harriet is half the age of Zack"" which translates to: h = z/2

**Solve for the variables:**

1. **Substitute:** Since we know h = z/2, we can substitute this into the first equation: a = 3 * (z/2) = (3z)/2

2. **Find 'z' (Zack's age):**  We can use the information that Harriet is 21 years old.  Since h = z/2, we can solve for z: 21 = z/2  =>  z = 42

3. **Find 'a' (Adrian's age):** Now that we know z = 42, we can substitute it back into the equation a = (3z)/2: a = (3 * 42)/2 = 63

4. **Calculate the average age in three years:**  In three years, their ages will be:
    * Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66
    * Harriet: 21 + 3 = 24
    * Zack: 42 + 3 = 45
    * Average age: (66 + 24 + 45) / 3 = 135 / 3 = 45

**Answer:** The average age of the three in three years will be 45.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Scene 1:** The first scene has twice the lines of the song, which has 54 lines.  So, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.  
* **Scene 1 (Sean's lines):**  The first scene has a third of the lines as Sean's, meaning he has 108 lines / 3 = 36 lines.
* **Scene 2:** The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, which has 54 lines.  So, the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
* **Scene 2 (Sean's lines):** The second scene has four-fifths of Sean's lines, meaning he has 60 lines * (4/5) = 48 lines.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Cards with A:**  We know 2/5 of Carly's cards have the letter A.  To find this, we multiply the total number of cards by the fraction: 80 cards * (2/5) = 32 cards.

* **Step 2: Cards Remaining:** After removing the cards with A, we are left with 80 cards - 32 cards = 48 cards.

* **Step 3: Cards with B:**  We know 1/2 of the remaining cards have the letter B.  This is calculated as: 48 cards * (1/2) = 24 cards.

* **Step 4: Cards Remaining After B:**  After removing the cards with B, we are left with 48 cards - 24 cards = 24 cards.

* **Step 5: Cards with C:**  We know 5/8 of the remaining cards have the letter C.  This is calculated as: 24 cards * (5/8) = 15 cards.

"To determine the total time, we need to consider the time required for each type of hole and the number of each type. 

* **Small holes:**  Each small hole takes 3 minutes to dig.  We need to dig 30 of them.  
   * Time for small holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes

* **Large holes:** Each large hole takes 10 minutes to dig. We need to dig 15 of them.
   * Time for large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes

* **Total time:**  To find the total time, we add the time for small holes and large holes.
   * Total time: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

* **Convert to hours:**  We need to convert the total time from minutes to hours.

**Answer:** 40 
"
"Let's tackle this problem using a system of equations. 

We can represent Ruby's current age as 'R' and Sam's current age as 'S'.  

From the given information, we can form two equations:

*  R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
*  R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now, let's solve for 'S' (Sam's current age).

**Solving for 'R' in the first equation:**
R = 6S

**Substituting this value of 'R' into the second equation:**
(6S) + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Simplifying and solving for 'S':**
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
3S = 18
S = 6

**Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.**

* **Let 'x' represent the number of sterling silver beads.**

We know the following:

* **Total length of topaz:** 8 inches
* **Total length of the necklace:** 25 inches
* **Length of each topaz:** 1 inch
* **Length of each silver bead:** 0.25 inches

We can set up an equation to represent the total length of the necklace:

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to figure out how many days it will last. 

* **Daily consumption:**  Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 2 meals per day, so the total daily consumption is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day.
* **Weekly consumption:**  The household consumes 0.4 kg/day * 7 days/week = 2.8 kg/week.
* **Weeks the bag lasts:**  The bag has 42 kg of rice, and the weekly consumption is 2.8 kg, so the bag will last 42 kg / 2.8 kg/week = 15 weeks.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of books Elise sold in the first year.** 
* **She sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year, so she sold 2x books in the first year.**
* **The total number of books sold in the first two years is 2x + x = 3x**
* **The total number of books sold in the first two years is 135 books.**
* **The total earnings in the first two years is 2x * $20 = 40x**
* **The total number of books sold in the third year is 250 - 50 = 200 books.**
* **The total earnings in the third year is 200 * $20 = 4000**
* **The total earnings over three years is 40x + 4000**

**Therefore, the total earnings over three years is 40x + 4000.**

"Let's break down Watson's earnings:

* **Daily earnings:**  Watson works 10 hours a day, so his daily earnings are 10 * $10 = $100.
* **Weekly earnings:**  He works 5 days a week, so his weekly earnings are $100 * 5 = $500.
* **Bonus:**  He receives a $300 bonus each week.
* **Total earnings:**  To find his total earnings for the month, we simply add his daily earnings, weekly earnings, and bonus: $500 + $300 = $800.

Therefore, Watson made $800 in April.

"Let's break down the savings calculation step-by-step:

**1. Ice Cream Savings:**

* The ice cream is discounted by $2 per tub.
* You're buying 2 tubs, so the total discount on ice cream is $2 * 2 = $4.

**2. Milk Savings:**

* We need the original price of the milk to calculate the discount per packet. 
* Once we have that, we can calculate the total discount on the milk.

**3. Total Cost:**

* The total cost of the ice cream is $26.
* We need the original price of the milk to calculate the total cost of the milk.

**4. Total Savings:**

*  We need the original price of the milk to calculate the total savings.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'C' represent Cera's current age.
* Let 'N' represent Noah's current age.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We know Cera is currently 46 years old:  C = 46
* Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* Six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age: N = 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age:  Population = 3000 * N = 3000 * 20 = 60,000

**Calculate the current population:**

* The population of Chile now is the population six years ago plus 6:  Population = 60,000 + 6 = 60,006

**Answer:** The population of Chile now is 60,006.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.  We know the following:

* **Offense:** The offense has twice as many players as the defense, so there are 2x players on offense.
* **Special Teams:** There are half as many players on special teams as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.
* **Total Players:** The total number of players is 105: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

**Combining like terms:** (7/2)x + x = 105

**Solving for x:**  To isolate 'x', we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 
(7/2)x * 2 + x * 2 = 105 * 2
7x + 2x = 210
9x = 210

**Finding x:** Divide both sides by 9:
x = 210 / 9

"To determine the cost of filling the pool, we need to calculate the volume first.  The volume of a rectangular prism (like a pool) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.  

* **Volume:** 6 feet * 4 feet * 5 feet = 120 cubic feet

Now, we know the volume is 120 cubic feet.  The cost per cubic foot is $0.10.  

* **Cost:** 120 cubic feet * $0.10/cubic foot = $12.00

Therefore, it will cost $12.00 to fill the pool.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

We know the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.  This means the ratio of girls to boys is 3:1.  We can represent this as a fraction: 3/1.

We also know there are 1/10 as many non-gendered children as boys. This means the ratio of non-gendered children to boys is 1/10.

To find the total number of children, we need to find the total ratio of all children.  We can do this by finding the total ratio of girls to boys and then adding the ratio of non-gendered children to that.

The total ratio of girls to boys is 3:1.  We can represent this as a fraction: 3/1.

The total ratio of non-gendered children to boys is 1/10.  We can represent this as a fraction: 1/10.

To find the total ratio of all children, we need to find the total ratio of girls to boys and then add the ratio of non-gendered children to that.

The total ratio of all children is (3/1) + (1/10) = 31/10.

To find the total number of children, we can multiply the total ratio of all children by the number of boys.

The total number of children is (31/10) * 30 = 93.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the ratio of electric poles to wires is 1:3, meaning for every 1 pole, we need 3 wires.  We're given that the total number of wires is 45.  

To find the number of poles, we can use the following steps:

1. **Find the value of one unit:**  Since the total number of wires is 45, and the ratio is 1:3, we can find the value of one unit by dividing the total wires by the ratio: 45 wires / 4 = 11.25.

2. **Calculate the poles:**  Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 unit of wire, we need 3 poles.  Therefore, the total number of poles is 11.25 * 3 = 33.75.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know the initial number of men and women at the party is 25 and 15 respectively.  We also know that 1/4 of the total number of people left.  

To find the number of women remaining, we need to consider the initial number of women and the number of people who left.  

**Here's how to solve it:**

* **Total people:** 25 men + 15 women = 40 people
* **People who left:** 40 people * (1/4) = 10 people
* **Women remaining:** 15 women - 10 people = 5 women

**Therefore, 5 women are left at the party.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Jam's pencils:** We know Jam has 24 pencils (26 total - 2 loose).
* **Meg's pencils:** Meg has 46 pencils.
* **Total pencils:** We need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have combined.

To find the total number of pencils, we can simply add the number of pencils each person has: 24 pencils (Jam) + 46 pencils (Meg) = 70 pencils.

Now, we need to figure out how many boxes they need to store all those pencils.  

**Answer:**  To store 70 pencils, they need 70 pencils / 12 pencils per box = 5.83 boxes. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, they would need **6 boxes** to store all their pencils.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

We know that each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees Celsius and reduces its volume by 12 milliliters.  We need to find the final volume of the coffee after cooling by 65 degrees Celsius and adding 15 milliliters of cream.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Cooling effect:** The coffee cools by 65 degrees Celsius.
* **Volume change:** Each ice cube reduces the coffee's volume by 12 milliliters.
* **Cream addition:**  15 milliliters of cream are added.

**Calculations:**

1. **Cooling effect:** The coffee cools by 65 degrees Celsius, and each ice cube reduces the volume by 12 milliliters.  Therefore, the total volume reduction due to the ice cubes is 65 degrees Celsius * 12 milliliters/degree = 780 milliliters.

2. **Total volume change:** The total volume change is the sum of the volume reduction from the ice cubes and the volume added by the cream. 

3. **Final volume:** The final volume of the coffee is the original volume minus the volume reduction and the volume added by the cream.

**Answer:** 795 milliliters

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of old records each person brought in.
*  *y* represent the number of new records each person received.

We know the following:

*  **Trade Ratio:**  Each person trades 2 old records for 1 new record. 
*  **Total Records:** 5 people traded records, and they left with 7 new records.

We can express this information as a system of equations:

*  Equation 1: 5x = 7 (This represents the total number of new records)
*  Equation 2:  We don't have a direct equation for the number of old records brought in.

**To solve for the number of old records brought in, we need to find a way to express the number of old records in terms of the number of new records.** 

**However, the problem statement is not consistent. It states that 5 people traded records and left with 7 new records. This means that the number of new records is not directly related to the number of old records brought in.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find the total amount of money the company pays to all its programmers each month.  We know the following:

* **Junior Programmers:**  The company has 2/5 of its employees as junior programmers.
* **Junior Programmer Salary:** Each junior programmer earns $2000 per month.
* **Senior Programmer Salary:** Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of junior programmers:**
   *  The company has 100 employees, and junior programmers make up 2/5 of the total.
   *  Junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 = 40

2. **Calculate the total salary of junior programmers:**
   *  Total salary = 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000

3. **Calculate the total salary of senior programmers:**
   *  Senior programmers = 100 employees - 40 programmers = 60 programmers
   *  Total salary = 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

4. **Calculate the total salary of all programmers:**
   *  Total salary = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000


**Answer:** The company pays a total of $224,000 to all its programmers each month.

* **Changes:**  We need to account for the people who got on and off at the other stops.
* **Let's represent the unknown:**  Let 'x' be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

**Setting up the equation:**

*  The total number of people at the terminal is x.
*  At the first stop, 5 more people got on, so there were x + 5 people at the terminal.
*  At the second stop, 7 people got off, and 8 more got on, so there were (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 people at the second stop.
*  We know that the total number of people at the third stop is 20.

**Solving for x:**

*  We can now set up an equation: x + 6 = 20
*  Solving for x, we get x = 14.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We are given the following information:

1.  **Equation 1:** c + w = 60 (The total number of animals is 60)
2.  **Equation 2:** c = 2w (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

**Solving for the variables:**

To solve for 'c' and 'w', we can use substitution.  Since we know 'c' is twice the number of cows, we can substitute '2w' for 'c' in Equation 1:

*  2w + w = 60

Combine like terms: 3w = 60

Solve for 'w':
* w = 60 / 3
* w = 20

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows is 20), we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find 'c':

* c = 2 * 20
* c = 40

**Calculating the total number of legs:**

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so there are 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so there are 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.

**Total legs:** 80 legs + 80 legs = 160 legs

**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

    * F = R + 20

* **Solve for the unknowns:**
    * Since F = B = G, we know the frog, beetle, and toad all weigh the same.  
    * Substitute the value of F from the third equation into the first equation:  (Y - 10) = R + 20
    * Solve for Y: Y = R + 30

* **Calculate the total weight:**
    *  The total weight is the sum of the weights of the frog, beetle, toad, snake, and bird: F + B + G + Y + R = 50 + 50 + 50 + (R + 30) + 20 
    *  Simplify: 50 + 50 + 50 + (R + 30) + 20 = 190

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

The train makes a series of trips between three cities.  We need to figure out how many days it takes for the train to complete a full service cycle.

**Key Information:**

* **Distance:** The train travels 75 miles between the first and second cities, 100 miles between the second and third cities, and 50 miles less than the combined distance between the third and first cities.
* **Frequency:** The train makes 3 trips per day.
* **Service Interval:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the distance between the third city and the first city:**
   * The second city to the third city is 100 miles.
   * The third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it's 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance of a single trip:**
   * The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:**
   * The train travels 225 miles per trip * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.

4. **Calculate the number of days between services:**
   * The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   * The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles.
   * The number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

5. **Round to the nearest whole number:**
   * The train needs service every 26.67 days, which rounds to **27 days**.


**Answer:** The train needs service every 27 days.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Erin scored 14 points.
* Sara scored 8 points.
* Erin has three times more points than Sara.

To find out how many points Erin had before, we need to figure out how many points she had *before* her current score.  

Let's use a variable to represent Erin's points before her current score. We can represent this as ""x"".

We know that Erin's current score is 14, and she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8.  This can be represented as an equation:

* Erin's points before = x
* Sara's points = 8
* Erin's points now = 14

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x = 3 * 8

Solving for x:

x = 24

Therefore, Erin had **24** points before her current score.

"Let's break down the cost of these senior awards. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames.  We have 44 seniors, and each needs a frame at a cost of $20.  This totals to 44 * $20 = $880.  

Next, we need to factor in the etching cost for each frame.  Each frame requires an additional 20% of the frame's cost, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4.  So, the total cost for etching is 44 * $4 = $176.

Now, we need to consider the cost of the pins.  Two seniors will receive pins at a cost of $5 each, totaling $5 * 2 = $10.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the cords.  1/4 of the seniors are officers, and each officer needs a cord at a cost of $12.  This totals to (1/4) * 44 * $12 = $132.

Adding all these costs together, we get $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.


**Answer:** $1198

"Let's solve this problem using a simple algebraic approach. 

We know that after selling 3/5 of his land, Mr. Ruther is left with 12.8 hectares.  This means the remaining land represents the amount he had initially minus the amount sold.  

Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.  We can set up an equation:

(1 - 3/5)x = 12.8

Simplify the equation:

(2/5)x = 12.8

To find the value of 'x', we can solve for it:

* Multiply both sides by (5/2): x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* Calculate: x = 32 hectares

**Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.**

"Let's break down the problem.  

We know the AC uses 900 watts of power for 8 hours per day.  This means it consumes 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours daily.

If Mel reduces his AC usage by 5 hours, his daily energy consumption drops to 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours.

To find the energy saved, we subtract the new daily consumption from the original: 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

Finally, we convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh) by dividing by 1000: 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kWh.

Therefore, Mel saves 4.5 kWh of energy in 30 days.

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of independent events. 

* **Event A:** A candle smells like wet dog.
* **Event B:** A candle explodes.

We are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.  

We want to find the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding.  

**Understanding the Relationship**

The events of a candle being defective and exploding are independent. This means that the presence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.

**Calculating the Probability**

* **Probability of Event A:** 5% of 50,000 candles = 0.05 * 50,000 = 2,500 candles
* **Probability of Event B:** 99% of 50,000 candles = 0.99 * 50,000 = 49,500 candles

**Final Answer:**

The probability of a candle being both defective and exploding is the product of the probability of each event occurring:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 2,500 * 0.05 = 125 

**Therefore, 125 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  'a' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
*  'b' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
*  'c' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  a + b + c = 500 (Total apples gathered by both sisters)
*  b = 2c (Sister gathers twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne)
*  c = 3b (Sister gathers 3 times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne)

Now, let's solve for 'a' (the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees).

**1. Substitute to eliminate 'b' and 'c':**

Since we know b = 2c and c = 3b, we can substitute 'c' in the second equation:

* c = 3 * (2c) = 6c
* 6c = c 
* 5c = 0

**2. Solve for 'c':**

* c = 0

**3. Solve for 'b':**

* b = 2c = 2 * 0 = 0

**4. Solve for 'a':**

* a + b + c = 500
* a + 0 + 0 = 500
* a = 500

**Answer:** Joanne gathered 500 apples from the average trees.

"We can solve this problem using a system of equations. Let's represent the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'.  

Our system of equations is:

*  c + d = 180  (The total number of heads is 180)
*  2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

To solve for 'd', let's isolate 'c' in the first equation:
* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let:

*  'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.
*  'y' represent the number of insects David found.
*  'z' represent the number of insects Lily found.

We know the following:

*  x + y + z = 43 (The total number of insects)
*  y = x/2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)
*  z = y + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)

Now we can substitute to create a system of equations:

1.  x + (x/2) + z = 43 
2.  z = y + 7
3.  y = x/2

Let's solve for 'x' in equation 3:
*  y = x/2 
*  z = y + 7
*  z = (x/2) + 7

Now substitute 'y' from equation 3 into equation 2:
*  z = (x/2) + 7

Now substitute 'z' from the above equation into equation 1:
*  x + (x/2) + ((x/2) + 7) = 43

Simplify and solve for 'x':
*  x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43
*  (5x/2) + 7 = 43
*  (5x/2) = 36
*  5x = 72
*  x = 14.4

Now that we know 'x', we can find 'y' and 'z':

*  y = x/2 = 14.4/2 = 7.2
*  z = y + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

**Answer:** Lily found 14.2 insects.

"Let's analyze this popsicle stick production problem using a linear programming approach. 

We want to maximize the number of popsicle sticks Frederick can produce while adhering to his budget constraint.  

**Defining the Variables:**

*  Let  'x' represent the number of 2x4 pieces Frederick buys.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of 2x8 pieces he buys.

**Objective Function:**

Our objective is to maximize the number of popsicle sticks (which is represented by the product of the number of sticks produced).  We can express this as:

Maximize:  1200x + 1200y

**Constraints:**

* **Budget Constraint:**  The total cost of the wood must be less than or equal to $24. This translates to: 4x + 6y ≤ 24
* **Wood Availability:**  Frederick can only buy whole pieces of wood. This means: x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0

**Solving the Problem:**

We can use linear programming techniques to find the optimal solution.  The most efficient way to solve this is to graph the constraints and find the feasible region.  The corner points of the feasible region represent the combinations of x and y that satisfy all the constraints.  We can then evaluate the objective function at each corner point to determine the maximum value.

**Conclusion:**

The optimal solution will be the combination of x and y that maximizes the number of popsicle sticks while staying within the budget and wood availability constraints.

"To find the total cost, we need to consider the number of pairs of snowshoes needed and the cost per pair.  

Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, and Mario needs 6 dogs, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of pairs by the cost per pair. 

Therefore, the total cost is 6 dogs * 2 legs per pair = 3 pairs of snowshoes. 

The cost of 3 pairs of snowshoes is 3 pairs * $12.00/pair = $36.00. 


**Answer:** $36.00

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach. 

**Understanding the Ratios:**

* The zoo has twice the number of cows as the farm, meaning the zoo's cow count is represented by 2 times the farm's cow count.
* The farm has half the number of sheep as the zoo, meaning the farm's sheep count is represented by 1/2 the zoo's sheep count.

**Setting up the Equations:**

Let's use variables to represent the number of cows and sheep:

*  Let 'f' represent the number of cows on the farm.
*  Let 'z' represent the number of sheep at the zoo.

We can translate the given information into equations:

*  f = 30 (The farm has 30 cows)
*  z = 2 * f (The zoo has twice the number of cows as the farm)
*  f = 1/2 * z (The farm has half the number of sheep as the zoo)

**Solving for the Variables:**

Now we can solve for 'f' and 'z' using the equations:

*  Since we know z = 2 * f, we can substitute that into the second equation: z = 2 * 30
*  Therefore, z = 60 (The zoo has 60 sheep)
*  Substituting z = 60 into the third equation: f = 1/2 * 60
*  Therefore, f = 30 (The farm has 30 cows)

**Calculating the Combined Total:**

Finally, we can calculate the total number of animals:

*  Total animals = f + z = 30 + 60 = 90

**Answer:** The farm and zoo have a combined total of 90 animals.

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios.  

* **Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.** 
* **Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia did, so Rose bought 4x onions and 4x potatoes.**
* **We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up an equation:** 4x = 12 
* **Solve for x (the number of onions Sophia bought):**  Divide both sides by 4: x = 3

* **Now that we know Sophia bought 3 onions, we can find the number of potatoes she bought:**  Rose bought 4x potatoes, so Sophia bought 4 * 3 = 12 potatoes.

* **Finally, calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought:** 3 onions + 12 potatoes = 15

"Let's break down Antonella's commission earnings.  

We have a tiered commission structure, meaning her earnings are calculated based on two tiers:

* **Tier 1:**  For sales up to $1000, she earns a fixed 30% commission.
* **Tier 2:** For sales exceeding $1000, she earns an additional 10% commission on the amount above $1000.

Here's how to calculate her earnings:

1. **Tier 1 Earnings:**  Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods. Since this is above $1000, we need to calculate her earnings from Tier 2.
2. **Tier 2 Earnings:**  The amount exceeding $1000 is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.  Her commission on this amount is $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Total Earnings:**  Her total commission is the sum of her earnings from both tiers: $300 (Tier 1) + $150 (Tier 2) = $450.


**Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  'x' represent the number of goals Anna scored.
*  'y' represent the number of goals Mark scored.
*  'z' represent the number of goals Richie scored.

We know the following:

*  z = y + 20  (Richie scored 20 more than Mark)
*  z = x + 45  (Richie scored 45 more than Anna)
*  z = 80  (Richie scored 80 goals)

Now we can use substitution to solve for the unknowns.  Since we know z = 80, we can substitute that into the second equation:

80 = x + 45

Solving for x:

x = 80 - 45
x = 35

Now we can substitute the value of x back into the first equation:

z = 35 + 20
z = 55

Finally, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:

Total goals = x + y + z
Total goals = 35 + 60 + 55
Total goals = 150

"Let's break down the food truck's profitability. 

First, we need to determine the cost per sandwich.  We know the cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, which yields 10 sandwiches.  Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.  

Next, we need to consider the cost of cheese and condiments.  The truck spends $30.00 on these per 10 sandwiches.  This translates to a cost of $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00 per sandwich.

Finally, we can calculate the total revenue.  The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00.  With 10 sandwiches sold, the total revenue is $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

To determine the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue.  The total cost is $0.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $3.00.  Therefore, the net profit is $70.00 - $3.00 = $67.00.

"The beanstalk's height doubles each day, so we can model its growth with an exponential function.  The initial height is 4 feet, and we want to find the number of days it takes to reach a height greater than the window's height of 20 feet. 

Let's represent the number of days as 'x' and the height as 'h'.  We know:

* h = 4 * 2^(x-1)  (where 2^(x-1) represents the doubling effect)

We need to find the value of 'x' when h = 20.  

Substitute 20 for 'h' in the equation:

20 = 4 * 2^(x-1)

Divide both sides by 4:

5 = 2^(x-1)

To find the value of 'x', we need to use logarithms.  Let's take the logarithm of both sides (base 2):

x = 180 / 6 = 30

Now that we know x, we can find the other angles:

* y = 2x = 2 * 30 = 60
* z = 3x = 3 * 30 = 90

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. 


**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To determine the additional time required to travel 2000 miles, we can utilize the relationship between distance, rate, and time.  

The key is to recognize that the plane's speed remains constant.  Therefore, we can set up a proportion:

* **Distance 1 / Time 1 = Distance 2 / Time 2**

Let's plug in the known values:

* 1200 miles / 3 hours = 2000 miles / Time 2

Solving for Time 2:

* Time 2 = (2000 miles * 3 hours) / 1200 miles
* Time 2 = 5 hours

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Ruiz's production:** Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.  This means his production rate is 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour.

* **Marissa's production:** Marissa makes 3/4 times Ruiz's production, so her rate is (3/4) * 60 pounds/hour = 45 pounds per hour.

* **Combined production:**  To find their combined production, we need to consider their individual rates and the total time they worked.  

* **Total production:**  Ruiz works for 12 hours, making 60 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 720 pounds. Marissa works for 12 hours, making 45 pounds/hour * 12 hours = 540 pounds.  Their combined production is 720 pounds + 540 pounds = 1260 pounds.

"Let's break down this problem using the principles of proportional reasoning and unit conversions.

**Understanding the Relationship:**

The key here is to recognize that the number of tire rotations is directly proportional to the distance driven.  This means we can use a ratio to find the number of rotations for a given distance.

**Calculations:**

* **Rotations per mile:** 725
* **Miles driven:** 400
* **Total rotations:** 725 * 400 = 290,000 rotations

**Finding the Time:**

* **Rotations per year:** 10,440,000
* **Total rotations for 400 miles:** 290,000
* **Years to replace tires:** 10,440,000 / 290,000 = 36.7 years

"Let's break down the cost of Joe's outfit.  

First, we need to figure out the price of the shirt after the 30% discount.  The discount is $7.50, so the price after the discount is $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.

Next, we need to add the price of the shorts, which is $35.  The total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $35 = $52.50.

Finally, we need to calculate the sales tax.  Let's assume the sales tax rate is 6%.  The sales tax amount is $52.50 * 0.06 = $3.15.

The final price of the outfit, including sales tax, is $52.50 + $3.15 = $55.65.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the price of a diamond jewel.
* The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond, so it's (4/5)x.
* The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold, so it's (4/5)x - $400.

We know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.  We can use this information to find the value of 'x'.

*  x = $2000

Now we can substitute this value of 'x' into the equations for the gold and silver jewels:

* Gold jewel price: (4/5) * $2000 = $1600
* Silver jewel price: (4/5) * $2000 - $400 = $1600 - $400 = $1200

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'a' represent the cost of one apple.
* Let 'o' represent the cost of one orange.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

* Equation 1: 4a + 3o = 5.20 
* Equation 2: 3a + 5o = 3.30

Now, we can solve for 'a' and 'o'.  One way to solve is using elimination.  

**Solving for 'a' in Equation 1:**

* 4a = 5.20 - 3o
* a = (5.20 - 3o) / 4

**Substituting this value of 'a' into Equation 2:**

* 3 * [(5.20 - 3o) / 4] + 5o = 3.30

**Simplifying and solving for 'o':**

* (15.60 - 9o) / 4 + 5o = 3.30
* 15.60 - 9o + 20o = 13.20
* 11o = -2.40
* o = -0.22 (This result is not possible as the cost of an orange cannot be negative)

**Conclusion:**

There is an error in the given information. The provided prices do not form a consistent system.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the total amount Ariadne earned from selling green hats in the first month.** 
* We know that she earned half the amount from red hats, so she earned x/2 from red hats.
* The total earnings from both colors in the first month is x + (x/2) = 3x/2.
* In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales from the first month. This means her earnings in the second month were (3/4) * (3x/2) = 9x/8.
* We know her total earnings in two months is $1050. 
* We can set up an equation: (3x/2) + (9x/8) = $1050

**Solving for x:**

* To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is 8.
* Multiply the first term by 4/4: (3x/2) * (4/4) = 12x/8
* Now we have: 12x/8 + 9x/8 = $1050
* Combine the terms on the left side: (21x/8) = $1050
* Multiply both sides by 8/21 to isolate x: x = $1050 * (8/21)
* Calculate the value of x: x = $400

**Calculating Total Earnings:**

* We know that x represents the earnings from green hats in the first month. 
* To find the total earnings in two months, we need to add the earnings from the first and second month. 
* Total earnings = $400 (first month) + $450 (second month) = $850

3. **Since R is equal to the sum of A, K, and R, we can set up an equation:**
   (3/4)A + 60 = A + 60

4. **Simplify and solve for A:**
   (3/4)A - A = 0
   (3/4)A - (4/4)A = 0
   (-1/4)A = 0
   A = 0

5. **Since A = 0, we can find K and R:**
   K = (3/4) * 0 = 0
   R = 0 + 60 = 60

6. **Finally, calculate the total amount they would have if they shared equally:**
   Total = (A + K + R) / 3 = (0 + 0 + 60) / 3 = 20

**Answer:** $20

"Let's break down the problem:

We're given that Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.  This translates to the equation: 2x + 3 = 21, where 'x' represents the number of books Sally has.

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it.  Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation gives us: 2x = 18.  Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 9.

Therefore, Sally has 9 books.

"To find out how many days it takes for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to figure out how many times 30 inches it grows per day. 

We know the bamboo is currently 240 inches tall.  To reach 600 inches, we need to add 30 inches to its current height 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

We can then divide the total increase in inches by the daily growth to find the number of days: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial toys:** James starts with 4 toys and needs 1 toy per dog, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 toys.

2. **New dogs:** The shelter now has 12 dogs.

3. **Double the dogs:** There are twice as many dogs as when James started, meaning there are 12 * 2 = 24 dogs.

4. **Total toys needed:**  James needs 24 dogs * 1 toy/dog = 24 toys.

5. **Toys purchased:**  He needs to buy 24 toys - 16 toys = 8 more toys.

"To solve this problem, we'll use a proportion.  

Let 'x' represent the number of hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes.  We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, so we can set up the following proportion:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

6 * x = 36 * 96

Simplifying:

6x = 3456

Now, divide both sides by 6 to isolate 'x':

x = 3456 / 6

Therefore, x = 576.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
*  *y* represent the number of cookies Max has.
*  *z* represent the number of cookies Katarina has.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  y = x + 12  (Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster)
*  z = y - 5  (Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max)
*  z = 68  (Katarina has 68 cookies)

Now, we can substitute the value of *y* from the first equation into the second equation:

*  z = (x + 12) - 5
*  z = x + 7

Since we know *z* = 68, we can substitute that in:

*  68 = x + 7

Solving for *x*, we get:

*  x = 68 - 7
*  x = 61

Now, we can substitute the value of *x* back into the equation for *y*:

*  y = 61 + 12
*  y = 73

Finally, we can find the total number of cookies by adding the number of cookies each person has:

*  Total cookies = 68 + 73 + 61 = 202

**Answer:** 202

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.**

* **Extending the dress by 50%:** This means we need to add 0.50 * x to the original length.

* **The final length is 140cm:**  This means the extended length (1.50x) is equal to 140cm.

* **Set up the equation:** 1.50x = 140cm

* **Solve for x:**  Divide both sides by 1.50 to isolate x: 
   x = 140cm / 1.50 = 93.33cm (approximately)


**Therefore, the dress was approximately 93.33 cm long in its original design.**

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the cost of one lollipop.
* Let 'y' represent the cost of one candy.

We know the following:

* 5x + 4y = 3.20  (The total cost of the lollipops and candies)
* x = 0.40 (The cost of one lollipop)

We can substitute the value of 'x' into the first equation:

* 5(0.40) + 4y = 3.20

Simplify and solve for 'y':

* 2 + 4y = 3.20

"Let's break down the cost of the fruit crate using weighted averages. 

* **Banana Price:**  The price of a banana is twice the price of an apple, which is $0.50.  Therefore, a banana costs $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.
* **Orange Price:**  Oranges are three times the price of a banana, so they cost $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.
* **Total Cost:**  We can calculate the total cost of the crate by multiplying the number of each fruit by its price and then summing the results. 
    * Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
    * Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
    * Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00
    * **Total Cost:** $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00

**Therefore, the price of the crate of fruit is $32.00.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find the total square footage of Brittany's comforter.

* **Blue squares:**  We know Brittany has 14 red squares, and there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.
* **Green squares:**  She has 6 more green squares than blue squares, meaning she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.
* **White squares:**  Brittany has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.
* **Total squares:**  The total number of squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.
* **Total square footage:**  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the comforter is 68 * 1 = 68 square feet.

**Answer:** 68 square feet

"Let's break down this problem using variables. 

* Let 'm' represent the number of dumplings Larry cooked for males.
* Let 'f' represent the number of dumplings Larry cooked for females.

We know:

*  m + f = total dumplings 
*  Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can express the number of dumplings each male ate as 'm = f + 1'.

We also know:

* Each female ate 3 dumplings.

Now we can set up an equation:

* f + (f + 1) = m 
* 2f + 1 = m

We can substitute 'm' with '2f + 1' in the first equation:

* 2f + 1 + f = total dumplings
* 3f + 1 = total dumplings

We know that the total dumplings eaten by females and males is 50.  

* 3f + 1 = 50
* 3f = 49
* f = 49/3 

Since we can't have a fraction of a dumpling, we need to adjust our thinking.  We know that each female ate 3 dumplings, and we know that Larry cooked for 8 males and 6 females.  We can use this information to solve for the number of dumplings Larry cooked. 

* 6 females * 3 dumplings/female = 18 dumplings
* 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings
* 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings

"Let's break this down using ratios.  The cat's speed is 5 times faster than the turtle's speed.  This means the turtle's speed is represented as a fraction of the cat's speed.  

* **Cat's speed:** 15 feet/second
* **Turtle's speed:**  Let's represent this as 'x' feet/second.

We know the turtle's speed is a fraction of the cat's speed, so we can set up a proportion:

15/x = 1/5

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

15 * 5 = x * 1

This simplifies to:

75 = x

Therefore, the turtle's speed is 75 feet/second.

Now, to find out how far the turtle crawls in 40 seconds, we can use the following:

Distance = Speed * Time

Distance = 75 feet/second * 40 seconds

Distance = 3000 feet

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let  'x' represent the number of hours the factory works on chocolate ice cream.
* Let 'y' represent the number of hours the factory works on vanilla ice cream.

We know the following:

* **Chocolate ice cream production:**  The factory makes 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour.  
* **Vanilla ice cream production:** The factory makes 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:**  The total number of quarts made is 100 (chocolate) + 50 (vanilla) = 150 quarts.
* **Equation 2:** The total time worked is x (hours) + y (hours) = 48 hours.

We can use these equations to solve for the number of quarts made in 48 hours. 

**To find the total quarts made, we can use the following steps:**

1. **Express the total quarts in terms of one variable:**
   *  We know that the total quarts made is 150 quarts. 
   *  We can express this as: 50x + 12.5y = 150

2. **Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**
   *  We can solve for 'y' in terms of 'x' from the second equation: y = (150 - 50x) / 12.5

3. **Substitute the value of 'y' into the first equation:**
   *  50x + 12.5 * ((150 - 50x) / 12.5) = 150

4. **Simplify and solve for 'x':**
   *  50x + 150 - 50x = 150
   *  150 = 150

5. **Solve for 'x':**
   *  This equation is always true, meaning there are infinitely many solutions. 

**Therefore, we can conclude that the factory can make any number of quarts of ice cream in 48 hours, as long as the total time worked is 48 hours.**

"Let's break down the problem. We're given that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  We need to find the length of Bobby's shoe, which we can represent with the variable 'x'.

Here's how to solve for 'x':

* **Translate the problem into an equation:**  Let's represent Topher's shoe length as '100' and Bobby's shoe length as 'x'.  The problem states that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe, so we can write this as: 100 = 9x + 10

* **Solve for 'x':**  To isolate 'x', we need to get it by itself on one side of the equation.  We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides: 100 - 10 = 9x 
* **Simplify:** 90 = 9x
* **Isolate 'x':** Divide both sides by 9: 90/9 = x
* **Solution:** x = 10

Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is **10 inches** long.

* Let Dora's age be represented by the variable 'd'.
* Let Dora's father's age be represented by the variable 'f'.
* Let Dora's mother's age be represented by the variable 'm'.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

*  f = 2d + 8  (Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age)
*  m = f - 4   (Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father)
*  d = 15   (Dora's age is 15)

Now, we can substitute the value of 'f' from the first equation into the second equation:

* m = (2d + 8) - 4
* m = 2d + 4

We can now substitute the value of 'd' from the first equation into the equation for 'm':

* m = 2(15) + 4
* m = 30 + 4
* m = 34

Finally, we can calculate the total combined age:

2. Find a common denominator: (3/2)x + (4x/2) = 250
3. Combine terms: (7/2)x = 250
4. Multiply both sides by (2/7) to isolate x: x = 250 * (2/7)
5. Calculate: x = 71.43 (approximately)

**Since we can't have fractions of cases, we need to adjust our answer.  Let's consider the fact that the total number of cases must be a whole number.**

**Therefore, the third house needs 250 cases of shingles.**

"To find the total number of fruits George has, we need to consider the relationship between pears and bananas.  

* **Let's represent the number of bananas as 'x'.** 
* **We know George has 45% more pears than bananas, which means his pears are 1.45 times the number of bananas.**

Therefore, we can set up an equation:

* **Pears = 1.45 * Bananas**
* **Pears = 1.45 * x**

**We also know George has 200 bananas.**

**To find the total number of fruits, we need to add the number of pears and bananas:**

* **Total Fruits = Pears + Bananas**
* **Total Fruits = 1.45x + x**
* **Total Fruits = 2.45x**

**Since we know George has 200 bananas, we can substitute that into the equation:**

* **Total Fruits = 2.45 * 200**
* **Total Fruits = 490**


**Therefore, George has 490 fruits.**

"Let's break down the cost of Mike's movie collection replacement.

First, we need to figure out the number of movies that are in series.  Since a third of his collection is in series, we have 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies in series.

Next, we need to calculate the number of movies that are not in series.  This is 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies.

Now, we need to determine the cost of the older movies.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies, so we have 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies that are older.  The cost of these older movies is 160 movies * $5/movie = $800.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the normal movies.  The total number of normal movies is 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies.  The cost of these normal movies is 400 movies * $10/movie = $4000.

The total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection is $800 + $4000 = $4800.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'd' represent the total distance to the vacation spot.
* Let 't' represent the total time spent traveling.

We know the following:

* **Distance driven:**  d = 50t (since they drove at 50 miles per hour)
* **Distance hiked:** d - 30 = 20(t - 1.5) (since they hiked at 20 miles per hour for 1.5 hours)

Now we can solve for 'd'. 

**Step 1: Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**

Since we know d = 50t, we can substitute this into the second equation:

50t - 30 = 20(t - 1.5)

**Step 2: Simplify and solve for 't':**

* 50t - 30 = 20t - 30
* 30t = 0
* t = 0

This result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.  

**Step 3:  Re-examine the problem:**

The problem states that they hiked for 1.5 hours. This means the time spent driving is 6 hours. 

**Step 4:  Solve for 'd':**

* d = 50 * 6 = 300 miles

**Answer:** The vacation spot is 300 miles away.

"Let's break down the cost of Andy's commute.

* **Daily Fuel Consumption:**  Andy's car gets 10 miles per gallon (MPG), and his daily commute is 5 miles each way, so he uses 5 miles / 10 MPG = 0.5 gallons of gas per day.
* **Weekly Fuel Consumption:**  Over a five-day work week, he uses 0.5 gallons/day * 5 days/week = 2.5 gallons of gas per week.
* **Weekly Cost:**  The current price of regular gas is $3 per gallon, so his weekly gas cost is 2.5 gallons * $3/gallon = $7.50.

**Therefore, Andy's car consumes $7.50 worth of gas per week.**

"To determine the school's overall pass rate, we need to consider the pass rates of each grade level and then calculate the weighted average. 

**Step 1: Calculate the pass rates for each grade level:**

* Third Grade: 340/500 = 0.68
* Fourth Grade: 40/100 = 0.40
* Fifth Grade: 400/500 = 0.80

**Step 2:  Calculate the weighted average pass rate:**

The weighted average is calculated by multiplying each grade's pass rate by its corresponding number of students and then summing the results. 

* Third Grade: 0.68 * 500 = 340
* Fourth Grade: 0.40 * 100 = 40
* Fifth Grade: 0.80 * 500 = 400

**Step 3: Sum the weighted results:**

340 + 40 + 400 = 780

**Step 4: Divide the total weighted pass rate by the total number of students:**

780 / (500 + 100 + 500) = 780 / 1100 = 0.7091

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of cars Joe has.** 
* **Robert's cars:** We know Robert has 20 cars.
* **Joe's cars:** Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.
* **Cars sold:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.
* **Cars given to mother:** Joe gives away twice the number he sold to his mother, so he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.
* **Cars remaining:** Joe starts with 40 cars and sells 8, then gives away 16, leaving him with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.

**Answer:** Joe remains with 16 cars.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Day 1:** Sandy walked for 8 hours.
* **Day 2:** She walked half as many hours as Day 1, so she walked 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.
* **Total Time:**  The total time is 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.
* **Total Time in Minutes:** 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

**Answer:** 720 minutes

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial count:** Hunter starts with 50 cars.
* **First break increase:**  He sees 20 more cars, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.
* **Lunchtime decrease:**  Half of the cars are gone, meaning 70 / 2 = 35 cars are left.

**Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during lunch break.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **First game:** Sasha scored 14 points. Julie scored 4 fewer than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.
* **Second game:** Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.  This means Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.
* **Total points:** To find Sasha's total points, we add her scores from both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.

**Answer:** Sasha scored a total of 18 points.

* Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins
* Difference: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 


**Answer:** 52

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let's use the variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
*  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
*  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now we can set up an equation representing the total number of cards:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplify the equation:

7x + 12 = 341

Solve for 'x':

7x = 329
x = 47

Now that we know PJ has 47 cards, we can find Becca's cards:

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Blue eggs:**  We know Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.  Let's represent the number of green eggs as 'g'.  Therefore, Cindy has 2g blue eggs.
* **Pink eggs:** She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 2g - 1 pink eggs.
* **Yellow eggs:**  Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. This means she has (2g - 1)/3 yellow eggs.
* **Total eggs:** To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of each color: g + 2g + (2g - 1) + (2g - 1)/3

**Answer:**  To find the total number of eggs, we need to solve for 'g' (the number of green eggs).  We can do this by setting up an equation: 
 
  g + 2g + (2g - 1) + (2g - 1)/3 = 27

  Simplify the equation: 
  
  5g + (2g - 1) + (2g - 1)/3 = 27

  Combine like terms:

  5g + 2g - 1 + 2g - 1)/3 = 27

  Solve for 'g':

  5g + 2g + 2g - 1 - 1)/3 = 27
  
  Combine like terms:

  9g - 2)/3 = 27

  Multiply both sides by 3:

  9g - 2 = 81

  Add 2 to both sides:

  9g = 83

  Divide both sides by 9:

  g = 9.22

  Since we can't have a fraction of an egg, we need to round this value to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Cindy has 9 green eggs.

  Now, we can calculate the number of blue, pink, and yellow eggs:

  * Blue eggs: 2 * 9 = 18

"Let's break down the cost of Milly's return. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost is:

* 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
* The book is 20 miles away, so the mileage cost is:
* 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
* The total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Next, we need to calculate the refund amount. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.  

* 75% of $32 = $24.00

Finally, we can calculate Milly's loss. The total cost of the return is $3.00, and she will receive a $24.00 refund. 

* $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00

**Answer:** Milly will lose $21.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Week 1:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
* **Week 2:** He produces half of that amount, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He produces three times the amount from Week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find the output for week 4, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Relationship**

The key here is recognizing that the distance traveled remains constant.  We need to find the time it takes for four turtles to cover the same distance as three kangaroos.

**Setting up the Equation**

* Let 'x' represent the speed of a kangaroo.
* The time it takes three kangaroos to travel is 18 hours.
* The distance traveled is 18x.
* The speed of a turtle is x/2.
* The time it takes four turtles to travel is what we need to find.

**Solving for the Time**

We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed.

* For the kangaroos: Time = 18 hours
* For the turtles: Time = Distance / Speed 

**Finding the Time for Four Turtles**

Since the distance is the same, we can set up a proportion:

* 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = Distance / 4 turtles

**Solving for the Time**

* 18 hours * 4 = 3 kangaroos * Distance
* 72 hours = 3 kangaroos * Distance
* 72 hours / 3 kangaroos = Distance / 4 turtles
* 24 hours = Distance / 4 turtles

**Answer:** 24 hours

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'K' represent the number of dishes Kora makes.
* Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes 'K + 20' dishes.
* Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes '2 * (K + 20)' dishes.

Now, we know that the total number of dishes is 140.  We can set up an equation:

K + (K + 20) + 2 * (K + 20) = 140

Simplify and solve for K:

K + K + 20 + 2K + 40 = 140
4K + 60 = 140
4K = 80
K = 20

Now that we know K (Kora's dishes), we can find Rory's and Jada's dishes:

* Rory: K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
* Jada: 2 * (K + 20) = 2 * (20 + 20) = 80

Finally, calculate the total number of dishes:

Total = K + Rory + Jada = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140

"To find the total length of glue sticks that are not used, we need to find the total length of the glue sticks that are used.  

First, let's find the total length of glue used:

*  (1/6) + (2/3) + (1/2) = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 = 4/3

Now, we can find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:

* 1 glue stick's length - (4/3) = 12 mm - (4/3) mm

To simplify the answer, we can convert the fraction to a decimal and then subtract:

* 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 12 mm - 1.33 mm = 10.67 mm

"The formula for simple interest is:  

**A = P(1 + rt)**

Where:

* A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
* P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
* r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years

In this case:

* P = $300
* r = 3/4 = 0.75 (as a decimal)
* t = 3 years

Plugging these values into the formula:

A = 300(1 + 0.75 * 3) 
A = 300(1 + 2.25)
A = 300 * 3.25
A = $975

Therefore, Brenda will have $975 after 3 years.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  'x' represent your age
*  'y' represent your brother's age
*  'z' represent your sister's age

We are given the following information:

1.  **x = y - 3** (You are three years younger than your brother)
2.  **x = z + 2** (You are two years older than your sister)
3.  **Mom's age = 3x - 1** (Mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)

Now, we can use these equations to solve for the ages. 

**Combining the equations:**

*  Since we know x = y - 3 and x = z + 2, we can substitute one equation into the other. Let's use x = y - 3. 
*  Substitute this into the equation x = z + 2:  (y - 3) = z + 2

**Solving for the ages:**

*  We now have two equations:
    *  y - 3 = z + 2
    *  x = y - 3 
*  We can solve for 'z' in the first equation: z = y - 5
*  Substitute this value of 'z' into the equation x = y - 3: x = y - 3
*  We can now solve for 'y' using the equation x = y - 3 and the equation z = y - 5. 

**Finding the solution:**

*  We can use the given information that the sum of our ages is 87 to solve for 'x'. 
*  This will give us a single value for 'x' which represents your age. 


Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the final steps of solving for 'x' and finding your age.

"This is a classic example of a discrete-time exponential growth model.  

Let's break it down:

* **Initial Population:** We start with 10 infected individuals.
* **Growth Rate:** Each infected person infects 6 new individuals per day.
* **Time:** We're interested in the number of infected individuals after 3 days.

To model this, we can use the following formula:

* **N(t) = N₀ * (1 + r)^t**

Where:

* N(t) is the number of infected individuals at time t
* N₀ is the initial number of infected individuals (10)
* r is the growth rate (6 in this case)
* t is the time in days (3 in this case)

Plugging in the values:

* N(3) = 10 * (1 + 6)^3 
* N(3) = 10 * (7)^3
* N(3) = 10 * 343
* N(3) = 3430

**Therefore, after 3 days, there are 3430 infected individuals.**

"Let's break down this problem systematically. 

* **Let 'r' represent the number of red cars.**
* **Green cars:** We know there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are 'r - 2' green cars.
* **Blue cars:**  The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, meaning there are 3 * (r - 2) blue cars.
* **Total cars:** The total number of cars is 12 (red) + (r - 2) (green) + 3(r - 2) (blue) = 75.

Now we can set up an equation to solve for 'r':

12 + (r - 2) + 3(r - 2) = 75

Simplify and solve for 'r':

12 + r - 2 + 3r - 6 = 75
4r + 4 = 75
4r = 71
r = 17.75

Since we can't have a fraction of a car, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's re-examine the problem.  We know the total number of cars is 75.  We also know the number of red cars is 12.  We can use this information to find the number of green and blue cars.

* **Green cars:**  We know there are 12 red cars, and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.
* **Blue cars:** We know there are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so there are 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.

Now we can calculate the number of yellow cars:

* **Yellow cars:** The total number of cars is 75, and we know the number of red, green, and blue cars.  We can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.  This gives us 75 - 12 - 10 - 30 = 23 yellow cars.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Carl's weight:** We know Carl is 16 kg heavier than Martin, so Carl weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.
* **Christian's weight:** Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, so Christian weighs 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.
* **Harry's weight:** Harry is 5 kg less than Christian, meaning he weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

**Therefore, Harry weighs 74 kg.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Earnings per month:** John earns 10 rentals * 3 hours/rental * $25/hour = $750 per day.
* **Monthly earnings:**  Since there are 30 days in a month, his monthly earnings are $750/day * 30 days = $22,500.
* **Profit after car payment:**  His car payment is $500, so his profit is $22,500 - $500 = $22,000.

**Answer:** $22,000

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'J' represent the number of notebooks Joseph has.**
* **Martha has 3 times the number of notebooks as Joseph, so she has 3J notebooks.**
* **Martha buys 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7.**  This means 3J = 7.
* **Solve for J:** Divide both sides of the equation by 3: J = 7/3.
* **Find the difference between Martha's and Joseph's notebooks:** Martha has 3J = 3 * (7/3) = 7 notebooks. Joseph has 21 notebooks. The difference is 7 - 21 = -14.

**Answer:** Martha has 14 fewer notebooks than Joseph. 


"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Dijana's distance:** Dijana rowed 50 miles.
* **Anis's distance:** Anis rowed 1/5 * 50 miles = 10 more miles than Dijana.
* **Total distance:**  To find the total distance, we add Dijana's distance and Anis's distance.

Therefore, the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed is 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles. 


**Answer:** 60

"Let's break this down.  We know Susan started with 100 cookies and wants to divide them equally among her 6 nephews.  

To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we need to divide the total cookies by the number of nephews: 100 cookies / 6 nephews = 16.67 cookies per nephew. 

However, Susan's husband took 4 cookies, so we need to adjust the number of cookies available for the nephews.  

The final answer is 96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of yards of material needed for a small mask.
* Let 'y' represent the number of yards of material needed for a large mask.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

* **Equation 1:** 2x = 4y  (Small masks use 2 yards of material for 4 masks)
* **Equation 2:** 2.25y = 3x (Large masks use 2.25 yards of material for 3 masks)

Now, we can solve for 'x' and 'y'.  

**Solving for 'x' in Equation 1:**
* 2x = 4y
* x = 2y / 2
* x = y

**Substituting 'x' in Equation 2:**
* 2.25y = 3 * (y)
* 2.25y = 3y
* 2.25y - 3y = 0
* -0.75y = 0
* y = 0

**Solving for 'y':**
* y = 0

**Solving for 'x':**
* x = y
* x = 0

**Answer:**  We have a contradiction.  The problem is not solvable as the given information is inconsistent.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

* **Let Duncan's current age be represented by 'd' and Adam's current age be represented by 'a'.**

* **We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago:**  This translates to the equation: d - 8 = 2(a - 4)

* **We also know that Duncan's current age is 60:** This means d = 60

* **Now we can substitute the value of 'd' into the first equation:** 60 - 8 = 2(a - 4)

* **Simplify and solve for 'a':** 52 = 2(a - 4)  => 52 = 2a - 8  => 60 = 2a  => a = 30

* **Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, add 8 to his current age:** a + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Let's represent the size of Farmer Brown's farm with the variable 'x'.** 
* **Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm, so we can represent that as '2x + 100'.**
* **The total acreage of both farms is the sum of their individual acreages, so we have the equation: x + (2x + 100) = 700**
* **Now, let's solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 3x + 100 = 700
    * Subtract 100 from both sides: 3x = 600
    * Divide both sides by 3: x = 200
* **We now know Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.  To find Farmer Smith's farm, substitute the value of x back into the expression 2x + 100:**
    * 2 * 200 + 100 = 400 + 100 = 500
* **Therefore, Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres and Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. The total acreage of both farms is 200 + 500 = 700 acres.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Define variables:**
    * Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
    * Let Paul's age be represented by 'P + 10' 
    * Let John's age be represented by 'J'

* **Formulate equations:**
    *  The combined age of all three is 100:  P + (P + 10) + J = 100
    *  Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age: P = (P + 10) + J

* **Solve the system:**
    * Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
    * Solve for J: J = 100 - 2P
    * Substitute the value of J back into the second equation: P = (P + 10) + (100 - 2P)
    * Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
    * Combine like terms: 3P = 110
    * Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

We can represent the points scored by each person with the following variables:

*  Let D represent Dinar's points.
*  Let A represent Azibo's points.
*  Let B represent Bahati's points.

We know the following:

1. **B = A + 20:** Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo.
2. **B = D + 10:** Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar.
3. **A + D + B = 45:** The total points for the team is 45.

Now we can solve for A (Azibo's points).

**Solving for A:**

* Since B = A + 20 and B = D + 10, we can substitute to get:
   * D + 10 = A + 20
   * A = D - 10

* Substitute this value of A into the third equation:
   * (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

* Simplify and solve for D:
   * 3D + 10 = 45
   * 3D = 35
   * D = 35 / 3 
   * D = 11.67 (approximately)

* Now, substitute the value of D back into the equation A = D - 10:

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to consider the time he worked and his stapling rate. 

First, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, he worked for 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we know that Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  To find the total number of reports stapled, we divide the total time worked in minutes by the time it takes to staple one report: 180 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 12 reports.

Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 12 reports. 


**Answer:** 12

"To determine Kim's total sleep time, we need to consider the time she was awake and the time she slept. 

* **Awake Time:**  She was awake from 2:15 am to 2:38 am, a duration of 23 minutes.
* **Sleep Time:**  She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so we need to subtract that time from her total sleep time. 

Therefore, Kim slept for 23 minutes - 5 minutes = 18 minutes. 


**Answer:** 18 minutes

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the total number of measuring spoons Jonathan has.**

* **We know he has 2/3 as many spoons as cups:** This translates to the equation:  x = (2/3) * 24  (since 2 dozen cups is 2 * 12 = 24)

* **Simplifying the equation:** x = 16

* **Pedro gives him 6 spoons:** This means Jonathan now has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.

* **Therefore, Jonathan has 10 measuring spoons remaining.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Step 1:**  The hospital has 1000 beds, and 1/5 are occupied, meaning 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds are occupied.
* **Step 2:**  Over two weeks, 50 patients are admitted daily, so in two weeks, there are 50 * 14 = 700 patients admitted.
* **Step 3:**  To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the occupied beds from the total beds: 1000 - 700 = 300 unoccupied beds.

**Therefore, the hospital has 300 unoccupied beds after two weeks.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.  We also know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.  

* **Aliya's age:** Aliya is 3 years old.
* **Shawna's age:** Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.
* **Shawna's father's age:** Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, who is 9 years old.  Therefore, Shawna's father is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

"Let's break down the problem. Kelly believes Courtney's number is too high.  To find the actual number of attendees, we need to figure out how many people were there if Courtney's number was inflated by 20%.

Here's how to do that:

* **Calculate the percentage increase:** 20% of the original number is 48 * (20/100) = 9.6 people.
* **Subtract the increase from the original number:** 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 people.

**Answer:** 38.4 people

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  *x* represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
*  *y* represent the number of balls Jason carried.
*  *z* represent the number of balls Jordan carried.

We know the following:

* Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey:  *y = 2x*
* Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason: *z = 2y*

We also know that the total number of balls is 7.  This can be expressed as:

* *x + y + z = 7*

Now we can substitute the values of *y* and *z* from the first two equations into the third equation:

* *x + 2x + 2(2x) = 7*

Simplify and solve for *x*:

* *x + 2x + 4x = 7*
* *7x = 7*
* *x = 1*

Now that we know *x* (the number of balls Jeffrey carried is 1), we can find *y* and *z*:

* *y = 2x = 2 * 1 = 2*
* *z = 2y = 2 * 2 = 4*

Finally, we can find the total number of balls brought by the coach:

* *Total balls = x + y + z = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7*

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Total holes dug:** The pirates dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.
* **Holes after filling in two:** They filled in 2 holes, so they dug 31 - 2 = 29 holes.
* **Holes on the fourth day:** The island had 4 times the number of holes at the end of the first day, meaning they dug 29 * 4 = 116 holes.

**Answer:** The pirates dug 116 holes on the fourth day.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Let's use variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips each of the two people get.
* The third person gets 15 more than the two, so they get 'x + 15' chips.

**Set up an equation:**

The total number of chips is the sum of the chips each person gets: 2x + (x + 15) = 265

**Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 3x + 15 = 265
* Subtract 15 from both sides: 3x = 250
* Divide both sides by 3: x = 83.33

**Find the total number of chips:**

Since we can't have a fraction of a chip, we need to adjust our answer.  Let's assume the number of chips is a whole number.  

**The problem is flawed:**

The problem states that only two people get an equal amount of chips, but the third person gets 15 more than the two.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Supplies:** Jen spends $400 on supplies.
* **Travel Cost:** The travel cost is 50% more than the supplies.  This means the travel cost is 1.50 times the cost of the supplies.

**To find the cost of travel, we need to calculate:**

* **Travel Cost:**  Let 'x' represent the cost of the travel.
* **Calculation:**  The travel cost is 1.50 times the cost of the supplies, so it's 1.50x.
* **Total Cost:** The total cost of supplies and travel is $400.

**Therefore:**

* **Equation:** 400 = x + 1.50x
* **Solving for x:** Combine like terms: 400 = 2.50x
* **Finding x:** Divide both sides by 2.50: x = 160

**Answer:** The cost of travel is $160.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

We can represent the number of Pokemon each person has caught with the following variables:

*  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
*  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:

1.  A = S + 5  
2.  S = 4W - 13
3.  A + S + W = 339

Now, let's solve for 'S' (Stan's catch).  We can use substitution or elimination.  Let's use substitution:

* **Substitute equation 1 into equation 3:**
   (S + 5) + S + W = 339
* **Combine like terms:** 2S + W = 339
* **Substitute equation 2 into this equation:** 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
* **Simplify:** 8W - 26 + W = 339
* **Combine like terms:** 9W - 26 = 339
* **Add 26 to both sides:** 9W = 365
* **Divide both sides by 9:** W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

Now, we can find Stan's catch:

* **Substitute the value of W back into equation 2:** S = 4(41) - 13
* **Simplify:** S = 164 - 13
* **Therefore:** S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"To determine the total time required, we need to consider the time spent on each type of stringing and their respective frequencies. 

Let's break it down:

* **Synthetic Gut:** 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
* **Polyester:** 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
* **Hybrid:** 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we can calculate the weighted average time:

Total time = (Time for Synthetic Gut * Number of Synthetic Gut Racquets) + (Time for Polyester * Number of Polyester Racquets) + (Time for Hybrid * Number of Hybrid Racquets)

Total time = (45 minutes * 3) + (110 minutes * 5) + (72 minutes * 4)

Total time = 135 + 550 + 288

Total time = 973 minutes

Therefore, it will take Andy **973 minutes** to string all the racquets.

"To find the number of slats Robert needs, we first need to determine the total length of fencing he'll use.  

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by: 2 * (length + width).

In this case, the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet.  So, the perimeter is: 2 * (15 feet + 10 feet) = 2 * 25 feet = 50 feet.

Since he needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing, he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

"Let's break down this problem.  

* Let 'x' represent the number of states in the USA.
* India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, meaning India has x/2 + 4 states.
*  The total number of states in both countries is x + (x/2 + 4).

To find the total number of states, we need to solve the equation:

x + (x/2 + 4) = 79

Now, let's simplify and solve for x:

1. Combine like terms: (3/2)x + 4 = 79
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: (3/2)x = 75
3. Multiply both sides by 2/3: x = 50

Therefore, the USA has 50 states.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Richard has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
* We know that the total number of cherries is 60: R + J + 30 = 60
* We also know that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard: R = J + 10

Now we can solve for our unknowns:

1. **Substitute the value of R from the second equation into the first equation:** (J + 10) + J + 30 = 60
2. **Simplify and solve for J:** 2J + 40 = 60
3. **Subtract 40 from both sides:** 2J = 20
4. **Divide both sides by 2:** J = 10

Now that we know Jerry has 10 cherries, we can find Robert's cherries:

* **Substitute the value of J back into the equation R = J + 10:** R = 10 + 10
* **Solve for R:** R = 20

Finally, we can find the difference between Robert's and Jerry's cherries:

* **Robert has 20 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries:** 20 - 10 = 10

**Answer:** Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

* **Let 'x' represent the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.**
* **Sunday's gingerbread sales:**  We know Sunny sold 10 boxes on Saturday, and 5 more than that on Sunday, so he sold x + 5 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
* **Sunday's apple pie sales:**  He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Sunday than on Saturday, so he sold x - 4 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.
* **Total sales:**  We know he sold x boxes of gingerbread and (x - 4) boxes of apple pie on Sunday. 
* **Total earnings:**  The earnings from gingerbread are 6x dollars, and the earnings from apple pie are 15(x - 4) dollars. 

**Setting up the equation:**

The total earnings for two days is the sum of the earnings from Saturday and Sunday.  We can write this as an equation:

6x + 15(x - 4) = 465

**Solving for x:**

1. Expand the equation: 6x + 15x - 60 = 465
2. Combine like terms: 21x - 60 = 465
3. Add 60 to both sides: 21x = 525
4. Divide both sides by 21: x = 25

**Finding the total earnings:**

* **Saturday's earnings:** 6(25) = $150
* **Sunday's earnings:** 15(25) = $375
* **Total earnings:** $150 + $375 = $525


**Answer:** Sunny earned $525 for two days.

* **The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.**  This means the red car's price is 60% of the blue car's price (100% - 40% = 60%).

**To find the price of the red car, we can calculate:**

*  $100 * 0.60 = $60

**Therefore, the red car costs $60.**

**To find the total cost of both cars, we add their prices:**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Emil's current age be represented by 'e'
* Let his dad's current age be represented by 'd'
* Let his brother's current age be represented by 'b'

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. **Equation 1:** e = 19 (Emil's current age)
2. **Equation 2:** d = 2 * e  (Emil's dad will be twice Emil's age when Emil turns 24)
3. **Equation 3:** b = e / 2 (Emil's brother will be half Emil's age when Emil turns 24)

Now, we can use these equations to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother.

**Solving for Emil's dad's age (d):**

* Substitute the value of 'e' from Equation 1 into Equation 2: d = 2 * 19 = 38

**Solving for Emil's brother's age (b):**

* Substitute the value of 'e' from Equation 1 into Equation 3: b = 19 / 2 = 9.5

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1.  Calculate the total width of the flower bed in inches:**

* The flower bed is 111 feet long, and 1 foot equals 12 inches.
* Therefore, the total width is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

**2. Calculate the spacing between plants:**

* Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between each plant.

**3. Calculate the total number of plants that can fit:**

* The width of the flower bed is 1332 inches, and each plant is 12 inches wide.
* The number of plants that can fit is 1332 inches / 12 inches/plant = 111 plants.

**4. Calculate the number of plants Pat needs to buy:**

* Pat already has 17 plants.
* The number of plants she needs to buy is 111 plants - 17 plants = 94 plants.

**5. Calculate the total cost of the plants:**

* Each plant costs $6.
* The total cost is 94 plants * $6/plant = $564.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Identify the given information:**

*  They have a total of 30 pounds of soil.
*  Each rose requires 1 pound of soil.
*  Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil.
*  Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
*  They are planting 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

**2.  Calculate the total weight of the carnations and sunflowers:**

*  Carnations: 10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/carnation = 15 pounds
*  Sunflowers: 4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/sunflower = 12 pounds
*  Total weight of plants: 15 pounds + 12 pounds = 27 pounds

**3.  Calculate the remaining soil:**

*  Total soil - weight of plants = remaining soil
*  30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

**4.  Determine the number of roses:**

*  Remaining soil / weight per rose = number of roses
*  3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses

"To solve this, we need to consider the time spent on both peeling and cooking. 

* **Peeling:** Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.
* **Cooking:**  She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To cook 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 minutes.

Therefore, the total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 15 minutes + 3 minutes = 18 minutes. 


**Answer:** 18 minutes

"Let's break down the temperature changes:

* **Low setting:** The air conditioner cooled the room 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a total cooling of 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.
* **High setting:** The air conditioner cooled the room 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours, resulting in a total cooling of 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.
* **Combined cooling:** The total cooling from both settings is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.

To find the final temperature, we need to consider the room's initial temperature and the cooling effect.  The room was 2 degrees warmer without the air conditioner, so the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature. 


**Final answer:** 18 degrees lower.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Key Information**

* **Comet Halley's Orbit:** The comet orbits the sun every 75 years.
* **Bill's Dad's Observation:** Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
* **Bill's Second Observation:** Bill saw the comet three times his dad's age when he saw it the first time.

**Setting up the Equation**

Let's use the information to set up an equation to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.

*  Let 'x' represent the number of years Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.
*  Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. 
*  Bill saw the comet three times his dad's age when he saw it the first time. 

**Solving for x**

*  Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time is 'x'.
*  Bill's age when he saw the comet a second time is 30 + x.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using the principles of fractions and proportions.

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
*  The first plane flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
*  The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany.

**Formulate the equation:**

*  The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**Solve for x:**

*  We know the other plane makes 22 trips. 
*  We also know that the other plane makes half the number of flights the first plane makes. 
*  Therefore, we can set up the equation: 22 = (1/2) * x

**Solving for x:**

*  Multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 22 * 2 = (1/2) * x * 2
*  Simplify: 44 = x

**Answer:** The first plane makes 44 flights in a day.

* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so she howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
* **Total howl time for Tobias and Chikote:** 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

To find the total time in minutes, we divide the total howl time in seconds by 60: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  

We need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.  

* **Let's represent the size of a kid's slice with the variable 'x'.**  
* **The adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice, so it's 2x.**
* **The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults + 4 kids).**

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to consider the size of their slice relative to the total watermelon.  

**The percentage is calculated as:**

(Size of adult's slice / Total watermelon) * 100%

**Let's simplify this:**

(2x / 6) * 100%

**We can further simplify this to:**

(x/3) * 100%

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let 'x' represent the number of chocolate bars in each box.  We can set up two equations based on the given information:

*  Lisa's sales: 3.5x 
*  Peter's sales: 4.5x
*  Total sales: 3.5x + 4.5x = 64

Now we can solve for 'x':

* Combine like terms: 8x = 64
* Divide both sides by 8: x = 8

**Answer:** Each box contains 8 chocolate bars.

"Let's break down the problem. We need to find the volume of the pool, then multiply that by the price per gallon. 

First, we need to find the volume of the pool.  The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.  

* Length = 25 feet
* Width = 14 feet
* Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume is: 25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Now, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons.  Remember that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons.

* Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10392 gallons.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost. The cost per gallon is $0.10.

* Total cost = 10392 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $1039.20

**Therefore, it will cost $1039.20 to fill the pool.**

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'r' represent the number of red sticks.
* Let 'b' represent the number of blue sticks.
* Let 'y' represent the number of yellow sticks.

We know the following:

*  r + b + y = total sticks 
*  b = r + 5  (5 more blue sticks than red)
*  y = b - 3  (3 less yellow sticks than blue)

Now we can substitute to solve for the total number of sticks:

1. **Substitute 'b' and 'y' from the second and third equations into the first equation:**
   r + (r + 5) + (b - 3) = total sticks

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   r + r + 5 + b - 3 = total sticks
   2r + b + 2 = total sticks

3. **Substitute 'b' from the second equation:**
   2r + (r + 5) + 2 = total sticks
   2r + r + 5 + 2 = total sticks
   3r + 7 = total sticks

4. **We know the total number of sticks is 34, so:**
   3r + 7 = 34

5. **Solve for 'r':**
   3r = 27
   r = 9

6. **Now that we know 'r', we can find 'b' and 'y':**
   b = r + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
   y = b - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11

7. **Finally, calculate the total number of sticks:**
   total sticks = r + b + y = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total gallons filled on the first day.**

* Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons.
* Ms. B pumps 3/4 of Wanda's amount, which is 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.
* Together, they fill 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total gallons filled on the second day.**

* Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount from the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.
* Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount from the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.
* Together, they fill 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total gallons filled in two days.**

* The total gallons filled in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

**Step 4: Calculate the gallons remaining.**

* The tank needs 18000 gallons to be full, and they filled 12000 gallons, leaving 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  We're dealing with a scenario where the power bank's capacity is changing over time.  

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Rate of Change:** The power bank loses a percentage of its charge each hour. This is a constant rate of change.
* **Working Backwards:** We need to find the initial charge, which is the starting point.

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Charge:**  We know the power bank has 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.  Let's call this 'x' to represent the initial charge.

2. **Understanding the Loss:**  The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours.  This means the power bank loses 9% of 'x' over 5 hours.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Charge:**  After 5 hours, the power bank has 55% of its charge remaining.  We can use this information to find the initial charge.

4. **The Key:**  The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for the next 3 hours.  We can use this information to find the initial charge.

**Let me know if you'd like to see the calculations for the remaining charge after 5 hours and the remaining charge after 8 hours!**

"The price of carrots increases by a compound interest rate of 5% each year.  To find the price after three years, we need to calculate the price at the end of each year and then add the price of the previous year. 

* **Year 1:** The price of carrots increases by 5% of the original price, so the price after one year is $120 * 1.05 = $126.
* **Year 2:** The price of carrots increases by 5% of the price from the previous year, so the price after two years is $126 * 1.05 = $133.70.
* **Year 3:** The price of carrots increases by 5% of the price from the previous year, so the price after three years is $133.70 * 1.05 = $139.76.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years is **$139.76**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total pictures:** Olivia uploaded 72 pictures.
* **Albums:** She divided the pictures into 8 albums.
* **Selfies:**  We need to figure out how many pictures are in the albums that are selfies.
* **Portraits:** We need to figure out how many pictures are in the albums that are portraits.

**Let's use algebra:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of selfies.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of portraits.

We know:

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
*  'y' represent the number of small stuffed animals sold.

We know the following:

*  **Equation 1:**  The price of large stuffed animals is three times the price of small stuffed animals. This translates to: 12x = 3y
*  **Equation 2:** Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. This translates to: y = 2x

Now we can solve for 'x' and 'y'.

**Solving for 'x' in Equation 2:**
   y = 2x 
   
**Substituting this value of 'y' into Equation 1:**
   12x = 3(2x)
   12x = 6x

"Let's break down this ore-mining problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Individual Mining Rate**

* A single dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day.

**Step 2: Steel Pickaxe Increase**

"Let's break down the problem using proportional reasoning.  

We know the price per sandwich is consistent across the packages.  

* **Package 1:** 2 sandwiches for $3
* **Package 2:** 4 sandwiches for $6

To find the price of the 8-sandwich package, we can set up a proportion:

*  (Price of 2 sandwiches) / (Number of sandwiches in Package 1) = (Price of 4 sandwiches) / (Number of sandwiches in Package 2)

Let's plug in the values we know:

* $3 / 2 = $6 / 4

Now, solve for the unknown:

*  Cross-multiply: $3 * 4 = $6 * 2
*  Simplify: $12 = $12

This means the price per sandwich is $12 / 8 = $1.50.

Therefore, the 8-sandwich package will cost $1.50 * 8 = $12.00.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using a systematic approach.

**Understanding the Relationships:**

* **Large beans:**  We know Grandpa needs 75 large jelly beans to feel full.
* **Medium beans:** He eats twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, meaning he eats 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.
* **Small beans:**  We're told 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium bean.

**Solving for Small Beans:**

1. **Find the ratio:**  We need to figure out how many small beans Grandpa eats for every 1 medium bean.  Since 3 small beans equal 1 medium bean, the ratio is 3:1.

2. **Set up a proportion:**  Let 'x' represent the number of small beans Grandpa eats. We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship: 
   3/1 = x/150

3. **Solve for x:**  Cross-multiply: 3 * 150 = 1 * x
   This simplifies to 450 = x

"Let's analyze this situation.  

The key here is to understand the opportunity cost of Jim's decision.  He's forgoing $25,000 per year in income while in college.  This is a direct cost of his decision.  

To determine the time it takes to recoup the loan amount and the lost income, we need to consider the future value of the loan payments and the lost income. 

**Here's how to approach it:**

1. **Future Value of Loan Payments:**  The $50,000 annual loan payment is essentially an investment.  We need to calculate the future value of these payments over the 4 years.  This involves using the future value of an ordinary annuity formula.

2. **Lost Income:**  The $25,000 annual lost income needs to be considered as a present value.  We can calculate the present value of this lost income using the present value of a single sum formula.

3. **Total to Earn:**  We need to calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to cover the loan payments and the lost income.

4. **Time to Earn:**  We can then determine the time it takes to reach this total amount.


**Conclusion:**

By applying these concepts, we can determine the time it takes for Jim to earn enough to cover the loan payments and the lost income.

"To determine the fabric needed, we first need to find the area of the bed.  The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide, so its area is calculated as 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  

Now, we need to consider the dimensions of the fabric pieces.  They are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they are 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

The area of each fabric piece is calculated as 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area needed is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  *x* represent the amount the first person received.
*  *y* represent the amount the second person received.
*  *z* represent the amount the third person received.

We know the following:

*  *y = x + $80* (The second person received $80 more than the first)
*  *z = 2(x + $80)* (The third person received twice the amount the second person received)
*  *(x + y + z) / 3 = $1920* (The total amount divided by the number of people equals the share of each person)

Now, let's substitute the values of *y* and *z* from the first two equations into the third equation:

*(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920*

Simplify and solve for *x*:

* (4x + $160) / 3 = $1920
* 4x + $160 = $5760
* 4x = $5600
* x = $1400

Therefore, the first person received $1400. 



**Answer:** $1400

"Let's represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set with the variable 'x'.  We know the following:

* **Set 1:**  x + 4 
* **Set 2:** x
* **Set 3:** x/2

The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of these sets: x + x + 4 + x/2 = 19

To solve for 'x', we can combine like terms and simplify the equation:

(5/2)x + 4 = 19

Now, let's isolate 'x' to find the number of balls retrieved in the second set:

* Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
* Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

**Answer:**  Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set.

"To determine the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation for each year.  

Since the depreciation is constant at 21% per year, we can use the following formula:

**Price in year n = Initial Price * (1 - Depreciation Rate)^n**

Where:

* Initial Price = $20,000
* Depreciation Rate = 0.21 (21% expressed as a decimal)
* n = Year number

Let's calculate the price for each year:

* **Year 1 (2008):** Price = $20,000 * (1 - 0.21)^1 = $15,800
* **Year 2 (2009):** Price = $15,800 * (1 - 0.21)^2 = $12,482
* **Year 3 (2010):** Price = $12,482 * (1 - 0.21)^3 = $9,875

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is **$9,875**.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Passengers:** Romeo starts with 120 people on the train.

2. **First Stop:** 20 more people join, increasing the total to 120 + 20 = 140.

3. **Second Stop:** 50 people disembark, leaving 140 - 50 = 90 passengers.

4. **Third Stop:** Twice the number who disembarked is 50 * 2 = 100 people.  This number is then added to the remaining passengers, resulting in 90 + 100 = 190.

5. **Final Stop:**  80 more people disembark, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 passengers.

**Therefore, the final number of passengers on the train is 110.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of slices Jake ate.
* Becky ate 'x + 3' slices.
* Silvia ate '2x' slices.

We know the total number of slices is 4, and each pizza has 8 slices.  We can set up an equation:

x + (x + 3) + 2x = 4 * 8

Simplify and solve for x:

4x + 3 = 32
4x = 29
x = 7.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we'll assume there's a slight error in the problem setup.  Let's assume the number of slices on each pizza was meant to be 10.

Now, we can solve for the number of slices each person ate:

* Jake: 7 slices
* Becky: 7 + 3 = 10 slices
* Silvia: 2 * 7 = 14 slices

Finally, calculate the total number of slices eaten: 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 slices.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

Let 'x' represent the time Donovan takes to make the meal.  Betsy's time is then 'x + 18'.  The total time is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Now, solve for 'x':

1. Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98
2. Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80
3. Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 'x' represent the number of feet of fence Sam has.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of feet of fence Harry has.

We know the following:

*  x + y = 100 (The total length of fence is 100 feet)
*  y = x + 60 (Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

Now we can solve for 'x' and 'y'.  

**Solving for 'x' in the second equation:**

* y = x + 60
* x = y - 60

**Substituting this value of 'x' into the first equation:**

* (y - 60) + y = 100

**Simplifying and solving for 'y':**

* 2y - 60 = 100
* 2y = 160
* y = 80

**Now that we know 'y' (Harry's fence), we can find 'x' (Sam's fence):**

* x = y - 60
* x = 80 - 60
* x = 20

**Finally, to find the leftover fence for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence from the total fence:**

* Sam's leftover fence = 100 - 80 = 20 


**Answer:** Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find Marcel's earnings.

**1. Trekking Bikes:**

* We know that half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.  
* This means there were 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes sold.

**2. BMX Bikes:**

* 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
* To find the number of BMX bikes sold, we multiply the total bikes by the percentage: 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

**3. MTB Bikes:**

* The remaining bikes were MTB bikes.
* We can find the number of MTB bikes by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes sold: 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

**4. Revenue Calculation:**

*  Now we can calculate the revenue for each type of bike:
    * MTB: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
    * BMX: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
    * Trekking: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

**5. Total Revenue:**

* Finally, we add up the revenue from each type of bike to find Marcel's total earnings: $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500

"Let's break this down step-by-step.  We know the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, and the T-Rex ate half of what was left after the velociraptors.  This means the velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat.  

To find the original amount of meat, we need to work backwards.  

* **Let 'x' represent the original amount of meat on the triceratops.**

We can set up an equation:

* **T-Rex's meal:**  x / 2 = 270 kg (The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg)
* **Velociraptors' meal:** x / 2 = 270 kg (The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex)

Solving for x:

* **T-Rex's meal:** x = 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg
* **Velociraptors' meal:** x = 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg

**Therefore, the triceratops had 540 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.**

"Let's break this down using proportions.  We know the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.  This means it blinks at a rate of 255 blinks / 5 minutes.  To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the time in minutes.
*  We know the ratio of blinks to time is constant: (255 blinks) / (5 minutes) = (459 blinks) / (x minutes)

Now, solve for 'x':

* Cross-multiply: 255 * x = 459 * 5
* Simplify: 255x = 2295
* Divide both sides by 255: x = 9 minutes

**Answer:** It will take the light **9 minutes** to blink 459 times.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  We're given information about the number of eggs painted by four individuals: Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah.  

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline paint together.
* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah paints.
* Let 'z' represent the number of eggs Camden paints.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

We can express the given information as a system of equations:

*  x + x = 2x (Arnold and Madeline paint the same number)
*  y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12 (Camden and Sarah paint a total of 30 eggs)
*  2x + 2y + 12 = 56 (Total eggs painted)

**3. Solve for 'y' (Sarah's eggs):**

*  From the second equation, we can simplify: y + y + 12 = 2y + 12
*  Combine like terms: 2y + 12 = 2y + 12
*  This equation is true for any value of 'y'.  

**4. Solve for 'x' (Arnold and Madeline's eggs):**

*  We know that x + x = 2x.  
*  We also know that y = 22 - x. 
*  Substitute the value of y into the equation: 2x + 2(22 - x) + 12 = 56
*  Simplify and solve for 'x': 2x + 44 - 2x + 12 = 56
*  Combine like terms: 56 = 56

**5. Solve for 'z' (Camden's eggs):**

*  We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.
*  We know that y = 22 - x. 
*  Substitute the value of y into the equation: z = y + 12 = 22 - x + 12

**6. Find the Difference:**

*  We can now find the difference between Camden's eggs and Arnold's eggs. 
*  z - x = 22 - x - x = 22 - 2x

**Answer:**  We can't determine a specific numerical answer without more information.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together.  We know:

* Valerie's monthly salary is half of her brother's.
* Their mother's salary is twice their combined salary.

**Setting up the Equations:**

Let's use variables to represent the amounts:

*  Let 'x' represent Valerie's brother's monthly salary.
*  Valerie's monthly salary is 1/2 of her brother's, so she earns (1/2)x.
*  Their combined salary is x + (1/2)x = (3/2)x
*  Their mother's salary is twice their combined salary, so she earns 2 * (3/2)x = 3x

**Solving for the Total:**

Now we can find the total amount of money they have:

Total = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary + Mother's salary
Total = (1/2)x + x + 3x 
Total = (1/2)x + (3/2)x + 3x
Total = (7/2)x

**Finding the Value of x:**

To find the total amount, we need to know the value of 'x'.  We can use the fact that their combined salary is $15000.

(3/2)x = $15000

To solve for 'x', we can multiply both sides by (2/3):

x = $15000 * (2/3)
x = $10000

**Calculating the Total:**

Now that we know x, we can calculate the total amount:

Total = (7/2) * $10000
Total = $35000


**Answer:** $35000

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the speed Grandma walks on the beach (miles per hour).**
* **The speed on the sidewalk is 2x (miles per hour).**
* **Time on the beach:**  We know she walks 2 miles on the beach at a speed of x, so time = distance / speed = 2 miles / x hours.
* **Time on the sidewalk:** She walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at a speed of 2x, so time = distance / speed = 1 mile / (2x) hours.
* **Total time:** The total time for the walk is the sum of the time on the beach and the time on the sidewalk. 
* **Total time = (2 miles / x) + (1 mile / (2x))**

**To find the total time, we need to find the value of 'x'.**

* **We know the total time is 40 minutes, which is equal to 2/3 hours.**
* **Let's set up an equation:** 
   (2 miles / x) + (1 mile / (2x)) = 2/3 hours

* **Solve for 'x':**
   * Find a common denominator: (4 miles / 2x) + (1 mile / 2x) = 2/3 hours
   * Combine terms: (5 miles / 2x) = 2/3 hours
   * Multiply both sides by 2x: 5 miles = (2/3) * 2x
   * Simplify: 5 miles = (4/3)x
   * Multiply both sides by 3/4: 3.75 miles = x

**Now that we know the speed on the beach (x), we can calculate the total time:**

* **Total time = (2 miles / 3.75 miles/hour) + (1 mile / (2 * 3.75 miles/hour))**
* **Simplify:** Total time = 0.533 hours 
* **Convert to minutes:** Total time = 0.533 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 32 minutes

* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Calculating the Probabilities**

* **P(A and B):**  The probability of a baby wearing a bow AND wearing purple is the same as the probability of a baby wearing a bow, which is 1/3.
* **P(B):** The probability of a baby wearing purple is 3/4.

**Final Calculation**

P(A|B) = (1/3) / (3/4) = 4/9

**Answer:** The probability of a baby wearing a bow given that they wear purple is 4/9.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Land:** Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

2. **First Sale:** He sells half of his land, which is 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.

3. **Remaining Land:** After the first sale, he has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left.

4. **Second Sale:** He sells another 1/4 of his remaining land, which is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters.

5. **Final Land:**  He has 40 - 10 = 30 square meters left.

6. **Final Sale:** He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter, earning 30 * $3 = $90.

7. **Total Earnings:**  His total earnings are $50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $90 (from the final sale) = $170.

"Let's break down the problem:

We know that Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age.  This translates to the equation:

Geb = (Haley's age / 2) - 10

We are given that Haley is 26 years old.  Substituting this into the equation:

Geb = (26 / 2) - 10

Simplifying:

Geb = 13 - 10

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old. 


**Answer:** Geb is 3 years old.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Cole's eggs:**  Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
* **Lamar's eggs:** Lamar found 5 eggs.
* **Stacy's eggs:** Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so she found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
* **Charlie's eggs:** Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so he found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
* **Mei's eggs:** Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
* **Total eggs found:**  In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
* **Eggs still hidden:**  There were 36 eggs in total, and they found 27, so 36 - 27 = 9 eggs are still hidden.

"Let's break down the avocado tree's fruit production over its 10 years.  We can represent the number of fruits produced by the tree as a sequence. 

* **Year 1:** 50 fruits
* **Year 2:** 50 * 3 = 150 fruits
* **Year 3:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 4:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 5:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 6:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 7:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 8:** 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* **Year 9:** 0 fruits
* **Year 10:** 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits

The pattern is that the number of fruits produced each year is a geometric progression where the number of fruits produced is multiplied by 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, and 20. 

The total number of fruits produced is 250 + 150 + 350 + 350 + 350 + 350 + 350 + 350 + 0 + 1000 = **2250 fruits**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so it's 'x - 7' centimeters long.
* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so it's '4(x - 7)' centimeters long.

Now, we can express the total length of the three ropes as a single equation:

x + (x - 7) + 4(x - 7) = 37

Simplify and solve for 'x':

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (x = 12), we can find the length of the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. 
"
"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios and fractions.

* **Let's represent the initial amount Ronnie had as 'x'.** 
* **Rissa had thrice the amount Ronnie had, so she had 3x.**
* **After each of them gave an equal amount to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money remaining.** This means she gave away (1 - 4/5) = 1/5 of her initial amount.

**Let's set up an equation:**

*  Rissa's initial amount - amount given to sister = (1/5) * Rissa's initial amount
*  3x - 3 = (1/5) * 3x

**Solving for x:**

* 15x - 15 = 3x
* 12x = 15
* x = 15/12 = 5/4

**Therefore, Ronnie had 5/4 of the initial amount, which is equivalent to $5/4 * $15 = $18.75**

"Let's break down this problem using proportions and fractions.

**Understanding the Problem:**

* We know the mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
* The amounts of red, white, and purple are equal.
* Half the mural is yellow.
* We need to find the amount of red paint used.

**Setting up the Solution:**

1. **Total Paint:** The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
2. **Yellow Paint:** Half the mural is yellow, so it uses 6 pints.
3. **Equal Colors:** Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, each color represents 12 pints / 4 colors = 3 pints.

**Finding the Amount of Red Paint:**

* The red, white, and purple paint are equal, and the mural uses 6 pints of yellow. 
* To find the amount of red paint, we can use the proportion: 
   *  (Red paint) / (Total paint) = (Yellow paint) / (Total paint)
   *  (Red paint) / 3 pints = 6 pints / 12 pints
   *  (Red paint) / 3 pints = 1/2
   *  Solving for Red paint: (Red paint) = (1/2) * 3 pints = 1.5 pints

**Answer:** 1.5 pints

"Let's break down the problem using the concept of a geometric sequence.  

A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor, called the common ratio.  In this case, the common ratio is 2.

* **Monday:** 3 puffs
* **Tuesday:** 3 * 2 = 6 puffs
* **Wednesday:** 6 * 2 = 12 puffs
* **Thursday:** 12 * 2 = 24 puffs
* **Friday:** 24 * 2 = 48 puffs

The sum of a finite geometric series is given by:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term
* r = the common ratio
* n = the number of terms

In our case:

* a = 3
* r = 2
* n = 5

Therefore, the total number of puffs Alice will count is:

S = 3 (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2) = 3 (1 - 32) / (-1) = 3 (-31) / (-1) = 93

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Starting Amount:** Thomas begins with 1000 dollars, and each $20 bill represents 20 units of currency.  Therefore, he has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills.

* **Loss:** He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

* **Bill Usage:** He uses half of the remaining bills, which is 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

* **Remaining Amount:** After using some bills, he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

* **Tripling the Money:**  He triples his remaining money, which means he now has 20 * 3 = 60 dollars.

* **Converting to 5 Dollar Bills:**  To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 60 / 5 = 12.

"Let's break down the problem:

1. **Total cost:** The company sold Mr. Marcellus 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost was 4000 * 3.5 = $14,000.

2. **Spoiled milk:** Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk, which is (2/5) * 4000 = 1600 gallons.

3. **Refund amount:**  To find the refund, we need to calculate the cost of the spoiled milk.  The cost of the spoiled milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600.  

4. **Final refund:** The refund amount is the total cost minus the cost of the spoiled milk: $14,000 - $5,600 = $8,400.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""**
* **Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""**

We're given two key pieces of information:

1. **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""**  This translates to the equation: W = 5(C + 7)
2. **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""** This translates to the equation: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns.

**Solving the system:**

* **Solve for W in the first equation:**
   W = 5(C + 7) 
   W = 5C + 35

* **Substitute this value of W into the second equation:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)

* **Simplify and solve for C:**
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   C - (5/3)C = 20 - 25
   (-2/3)C = -5
   C = 15/2

* **The answer:**
   Colin is currently 15/2 years old, which simplifies to 7.5 years old.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.
* Let 'y' represent Aaron's speed in miles per minute.

We know the following:

*  Vanessa's distance is twice Aaron's distance:  Vanessa's distance = 2 * Aaron's distance
*  Vanessa's time is twice Aaron's time: Vanessa's time = 2 * Aaron's time

We are given that Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran 16 minutes.  

**Setting up the equations:**

*  Vanessa's distance = 4 miles
*  Aaron's distance = 2 miles
*  Vanessa's time = 4 miles / x minutes
*  Aaron's time = 2 miles / y minutes

**Solving for Vanessa's time:**

We know Vanessa's time is twice Aaron's time, so we can write:

Vanessa's time = 2 * Aaron's time

Substituting the values we know:

4 miles / x = 2 * 16 minutes / y

**Simplifying the equation:**

4 miles / x = 32 minutes / y

**Solving for y (Vanessa's speed):**

To solve for Vanessa's speed (y), we can cross-multiply:

4 miles * y = 32 minutes * x

We can also use the fact that Vanessa's distance is twice Aaron's distance to find y:

Vanessa's distance = 2 * Aaron's distance
4 miles = 2 * 2 miles
4 miles = 4 miles

**Solving for y (Vanessa's speed):**

We can now solve for y by substituting the value of Vanessa's distance into the equation:

4 miles * y = 32 minutes * x

4 miles * y = 32 minutes * 16 minutes / y

**Final Answer:**

Vanessa took 4 minutes to complete her part of the race.
