"Okay, so we gotta add up all the guesses.  

*  One guy says 80.
*  Another says 20 more than half of that, which is 40.
*  The third guy says 25% more than the first one, which is 80 times 0.25, which is 20.

So, we add all those up: 80 + 40 + 100 = 220.

Then we divide that by how many guesses we had: 220 / 3 = 73.

So the answer is 73.

"Okay, so he runs 60 miles a week.  He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days.  How fast does he run?

*  He runs 60 miles a week.
*  He runs 3 days a week.
*  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days. 
*  He runs 60 miles / 9 hours = 6.67 miles per hour.

"Okay, so Dana runs fast, right?  She runs four times faster than she walks.  She skips, that's like, half as fast as she runs.  She skips three miles an hour, so how far can she run in six hours?  

*  **A:** 12 miles
*  **B:** 24 miles
*  **C:** 36 miles
*  **D:** 48 miles

I think it's 12 miles.  She runs for two hours, right?  So she runs 12 miles.  She walks for four hours, so she walks 12 miles.  That's 12 miles plus 12 miles, right?  That's 24 miles. 


**Answer:** 24 miles

"Okay, so Grandma made 5 pies, and each pie has 8 slices. That's 5 pies * 8 slices/pie = 40 slices.  Then, after everyone ate some, there were 14 left. So, 40 slices - 14 slices = 26 slices.

"Okay, so you got a bag of chips, right?  It says it's 250 calories per serving.  You got a big bag, 300 grams.  You wanna know how many you can eat?  

Here's the thing, you gotta figure out how many servings are in the bag.  So, you got 5 servings.  

Now, you gotta figure out how many calories you can eat.  You've already had 1800 calories.  You need 2000 calories for the day.  So, you can eat 200 calories.  

You can eat 200 grams of chips.

"Okay, so she writes a lot of articles, right?  She writes five on Monday, and then more on Tuesday, and even more on Wednesday.  So, she writes 5 + 2 * 5 = 11 articles.  That's a lot of writing!  And she spends 11 articles * 4 hours/article = 44 hours writing.  That's a lot of time! 

**Answer:** 44 
"
"Okay, so she had 80 notes in her purse.  Then she used some at work, and she had some left over.  So, she had 243 notes total.  To figure out how many she got at the store, we need to subtract the ones she had in her purse from the total.  So, 323 - 80 = 243.  That's the answer!

"Okay, so the top level is 16 square feet.  The next level is half that, so it's 16 / 2 = 8.  Then the next level is half of 8, which is 8 / 2 = 4.  The last level is half of 4, which is 4 / 2 = 2.  So the total is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.  That means the average is 30 / 4 = 7.5. 

**Answer:** 7.5

"Okay, so two girls got some water, right?  They got 1/6 of the water, so that's 24 liters / 6 = 4 liters each.  Then a boy got 6 liters.  So, that's 4 liters + 6 liters = 10 liters.  That's a lot of water!  But, we need to know how much is left.  So, we take the total water and subtract the water the boy got: 24 liters - 10 liters = 14 liters.  So, there's 14 liters left.

So, she has a bunch of lumber, but we need to know how much she sells it for to figure out how much money she makes.

"Okay, so we know Katy uses sugar and water in a special mix.  She uses 7 parts sugar for every 13 parts water.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar.  

To figure out how much sugar she used, we need to think about how many parts of the mix that is.  We know she used 120 teaspoons of sugar, and that's like 1 part of the mix.  So, we can figure out how many teaspoons of sugar she used by doing 120 teaspoons / 7 parts = 17.14 teaspoons.

"Okay, so we know they had 10 cars the first day.  Then they got more cars, and now they have 40.  So, we need to figure out how many more cars they got.  

* 40 cars - 10 cars = 30 cars
* 30 cars / 5 cars per container = 6 containers 

So, they brought in 6 containers. 


**Answer:** 6

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much money Adrien and Lylah make.  We know Adrien made more than Lylah, and we know he got a raise.  

Let's think about it like this:

* Adrien made $40,000 four years ago.
* He got a raise, so now he makes more.
* We know he makes 40% more now.

So, Adrien's new salary is $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

We also know Lylah made less than Adrien, but we don't know how much.

* We know Adrien made 30% more than Lylah.

So, we can figure out how much Lylah made four years ago.  

* Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.
* $40,000 = Lylah's salary * 1.30

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately).

Now, we know Lylah's salary now.

* Lylah's salary now is $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).

Finally, we can figure out how much they make together.

* Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.


So, they make $60,300 together.

"Okay, so we know there are 700 bees in the hive.  

*  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
*  We also know there are twice as many babies as queens.

So, let's figure out how many of each there are. 

*  Let's say there are 'q' queens.
*  Then there are 'b' babies.
*  And there are 'w' worker bees.

We know that:

*  w = 2b 
*  b = 2q

So, we can use that to figure out how many of each there are. 

Let's put it all together:

*  q + b + w = 700

We can plug in the values we know:

*  q + 2q + 2(2q) = 700

Now, let's solve for q:

*  q + 2q + 4q = 700
*  7q = 700
*  q = 100

Now that we know there are 100 queens, we can figure out how many worker bees there are:

*  w = 2b
*  w = 2 * 2q
*  w = 2 * 2 * 100
*  w = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees.

"Okay, so the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons all need bananas.  We need to figure out how many bananas we need to buy for two months.  

* **Monkeys:** 200 bananas
* **Gorillas:** 400 bananas
* **Baboons:** 100 bananas

That's a lot of bananas!  So, we need to add them all up. 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas.

Now we need to figure out how many bananas we need for two months. 700 bananas * 2 months = 1400 bananas.

**Answer:** 1400 bananas

A year is 12 months, so she's paying $1500 * 12 = $18,000 a year.

"Okay, so Bo has 40 crabs.  Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.  All together, they have 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs. 

**Answer:** 122

"The winner got 3 out of 4 of the votes.  So, they got 3 times 80, which is 240.  The loser got the rest, which is 80 minus 240, which is -160.  That doesn't make sense, so we need to think about it another way.  The loser got 80 - 240 = -160 votes.

"Okay, so Jerry's got a six-sided die.  He's gonna roll it.  

*  He could get a number bigger than 3, like 4, 5, or 6.  That's 3 chances out of 6.  So that's 3 out of 6, or 50%.
*  He could also get two even numbers in a row.  There are 3 even numbers, and he could get one on the first roll, and then another on the second.  That's 3 out of 6, or 50%.

So, he's got a 50% chance of getting a number bigger than 3, and a 50% chance of getting two even numbers in a row.  

**Answer:**  50%

"Okay, so the farmer sells the wheat for $20 a bag, and it costs $2 to get it to the warehouse.  The trader made $400 after selling all the bags.  So, how many bags did he sell? 

Here's how I figure it out:

* **Think about the money:** The trader made $400, and that's after he sold the bags.
* **Think about the cost:** He spent $20 for each bag, and he had to pay to get them to the warehouse.
* **Think about the price:** He sold each bag for $30.

Let's see...

"Michael rode his bike a lot!  He rode it 5 times a week for 4 weeks, and that's 5 times 25 kilometers each time, which is 125 kilometers. Then he rode it 2 times a week for 3 weeks, and that's 2 times 60 kilometers each time, which is 120 kilometers.  So, he rode a total of 125 + 120 = 245 kilometers.

"Okay, so Joe has a lot of candy!  He has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.  The chocolate bars are heavy, they weigh twice as much as the apples.  Each chocolate bar is 40 grams.  So, how much do the apples weigh?  They weigh 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.  That's a lot of apples!  So, how much do all the apples weigh?  80 apples * 20 grams/apple = 1600 grams.  And the chocolate bars?  25 bars * 40 grams/bar = 1000 grams.  So, all the candy weighs 1600 grams + 1000 grams = 2600 grams.  That's a lot of candy!

*  We know half a dozen plates cost $36,000.
*  Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that. 
*  So, we gotta figure out how much twenty dozen cups cost. 

Let's see... $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800. 

Now, we know there are 240 cups in twenty dozen. 

So, each cup costs $34,800 / 240 = $145. 


**Answer: $145**

"Okay, so Jerry has chickens, right?  He gets eggs from red and white chickens.  We know he gets 42 eggs a day.  He has more white chickens than red chickens.  

Let's see...

* **How many red chickens does Jerry have?**

   a) 10
   b) 12
   c) 14

"Okay, so we got snails and fish.  We know the snails are different, but we also know the difference is twice the fish.  So, we need to figure out how many fish there are. 

*  Snails in the first aquarium: 4
*  Snails in the second aquarium: 32
*  The difference is twice the fish: 32 - 4 = 28

So, we know the difference is 28.  We need to figure out how many fish are in each aquarium. 

*  The difference is twice the fish, so we need to divide 28 by 2. 
*  28 / 2 = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

"Okay, so the makeup lady charges $250 an hour.  She works for 6 hours a day, and she does it 4 days a week.  That's a lot of makeup!  The movie is 5 weeks long.  So, she works for 5 weeks * 4 days/week = 20 days.  That's a lot of makeup!  She gets a discount because she did a lot of work.  The discount is 10% of the total cost.  So, the total cost is $27,000. 

**Answer:** $27,000

"Okay, so she spent a lot of money on stuff for her sister's party.  She spent $12 on cake, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags.  That's a lot of money!  She split it up with her parents, so each person had to pay a little bit.  To figure out how much each person paid, we need to figure out how much money they paid.  

**Answer:** $31.33

"Okay, so Sean has two scenes and a song.  The song has 54 lines.  The first scene is twice the song, but only a third of it is Sean's lines.  The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of those lines are Sean's.  So, how many lines does Sean have to memorize?

"Okay, so he digs small holes for 30 of them, that takes him 3 minutes each, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.  Then he digs 15 big holes, each one takes 10 minutes, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.  So, all together, it takes him 90 + 150 = 240 minutes.  That's like, 240 minutes, which is 4 hours. 

**Answer:** 4 hours

"Okay, so we got 12 people on the team, and 3 coaches, right?  That's 15 people total.  Each person brings two guests, so that's 15 people * 2 guests/person = 30 guests.  And we need a pizza for each of those 30 people.  So we need 30 people / 3 people/pizza = 10 pizzas.  And each pizza costs $15, so that's 10 pizzas * $15/pizza = $150. 

**Answer:** $150

"Okay, so the fast car is going 60 miles an hour, right?  The slow car is going half that, so it's 30 miles an hour.  We know the fast car went 480 miles, so we need to figure out how long it took.  

The slow car went the same distance, so we can use that to figure out how long it took.  

* 480 miles = 30 miles an hour * time 
* Time = 480 miles / 30 miles an hour = 16 hours 

So, the slow car took 16 hours.

The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so it was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.  So, the population of Chile now is 60,000 + 6 = 60,006.

"Okay, so we know the team has 105 players.  The offense has twice as many as the defense, so let's say the defense has 'x' players.  Then the offense has 2x players.  And the special teams have half as many as the defense, so they have x/2 players.  So, we know:

* x (defense) + 2x (offense) + x/2 (special teams) = 105

Let's add up all the players: x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Now, let's make it easier to solve: (7/2)x = 105

To find out how many players are on the defense, we need to get 'x' by itself.  So, we do:

x = 105 * (2/7) = 30

So, there are **30** players on the defense.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how much the programmers make.  

* First, we know there are 100 people working there.
*  Two-fifths of them are junior programmers. That's like, 100 / 5 = 20 people.
*  Junior programmers get $2000 a month.
*  Senior programmers make $400 more than the juniors, so they get $2000 + $400 = $2400 a month.
*  So, we gotta add up all the money the juniors make: 20 people * $2000 = $40,000
*  Then we gotta add up the money the seniors make: 60 people * $2400 = $144,000
*  Finally, we add all that up: $40,000 + $144,000 = $184,000 


**Answer:** $184,000

"Okay, so we gotta figure out which job is better. 

Job A pays $15 an hour, and that's a lot of hours, 2000!  But then they take 20% of that money, which is like taking a big chunk out.  

Job B pays $42,000 a year.  That's a lot of money! But they take some money for taxes, like $6,000 for property taxes.  Then they take 10% of the rest.

So, which one is better?  

**A. Job A**
**B. Job B**

So, each person gets 24 / 4 = 6 guns.

"Okay, so Maria buys 8 shares of stock for $8 each.  Then it goes up 50% the first year, so it's $8 * 1.50 = $12.  Then it goes down 25% the second year, so it's $12 * 0.75 = $9.  So the final price is $9. 

**Answer: $9**

"Okay, so Farmer Brown has a bunch of animals, right?  He's got chickens and cows.  He has twice as many chickens as cows.  So, how many legs do they have all together?

* **A.** 120
* **B.** 160
* **C.** 200

"Okay, so he did boating, swimming, and watching shows.  He did boating for six hours, and then he swam for half that time, which is three hours.  Then he watched three shows, and each show was two hours long, so that's six hours.  He did all that for a total of 9 hours.  Then he watched shows for 6 hours.  That's 15 hours total.  He spent 40% of his time watching shows.  So, he spent 6 hours on sightseeing. 


**Answer:** 6 hours

"Okay, so Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400. She has $80 saved already.  She works two jobs.  One pays $10 an hour and she works 20 hours. That's $10 times 20, which is $200.  Then she works another 15 hours at a job that pays $5 an hour. That's $5 times 15, which is $75.  So, she makes $200 + $75 = $275.  She needs $400 - $275 = $125 more.

"Okay, so Marisa gets five dollars a day, right? And she buys four lollipops, each one is twenty-five cents.  So, that's four times twenty-five cents, which is a dollar.  She saves the rest, which is five dollars minus a dollar, which is four dollars.  If she does this for five days, she'll have four dollars a day times five days, which is twenty dollars.

"Okay, so the train goes a long way, right?  It goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 less than that.  So it's 100 miles plus 50 less, which is 100 - 50 = 50 miles.  That's a lot of miles!  So, it goes 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.  That's a lot of miles!  

The train goes that far every day, and it needs a break every 18,000 miles.  So, how many days does it take to go that far?  

**A. 18,000 miles / 225 miles = 80 days**

"Okay, so Karan borrowed money, right?  She has to pay it back every month.  To figure out how much she has to pay each month, we need to know how much interest she's paying.  

* **Interest:**  She's paying 10% interest on the whole loan.  That's like, a tenth of the money she borrowed.
* **Monthly Interest:**  To figure out how much she pays each month, we divide the yearly interest by 12 months.  So, that's $365 / 12 = $30.42.
* **Total Payment:**  So, she has to pay back the whole loan plus the interest.  That's $3650 + $30.42 = $3680.42.

"Okay, so Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, and 40 more gold pesos.  

To find out how much they have together, we need to add up their pesos. 

* **Anna's silver pesos:**  Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.
* **Anna's gold pesos:** Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.
* **Total pesos for Axel and Anna:** Axel has 50 + 80 = 130 pesos. Anna has 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.
* **Total pesos together:**  They have 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.

So the answer is 350.

So, let's add all the numbers up: 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400.  Then, we divide that by the number of tests: 400 / 5 = 80.  So, his grade is 80. 


 
**80**

To figure out what percentage of her time she spent editing, we need to figure out how much time she spent on editing.  

* **Total time:** Four hours + two hours + 90 minutes = six hours and thirty minutes.
* **Editing time:** 90 minutes.
* **Percentage:** 90 minutes / 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 25%

So the answer is 25%.

"Okay, so the AC uses 900 watts every hour, right?  He uses it for 8 hours a day.  So, that's 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours a day.  If he uses it for 3 hours less, that's 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours a day.  He saves 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watt-hours a day.  That's a lot of watt-hours!  Over 30 days, he saves 4500 watt-hours * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours.  That's a lot of watt-hours!  That's like, a whole lot of electricity!  So, he saves 135,000 watt-hours.  That's 135 kilowatt-hours. 


**Final answer: 135 kWh**

"Okay, so Tyson wants to make sandwiches for a bunch of people.  He needs meat and cheese for each sandwich, and each sandwich is for four people.  He's got 20 people coming to watch the game.  He needs to figure out how much it'll cost him.  

* **Meat:**  He needs 5 pounds of meat, 'cause he's making 5 sandwiches.
* **Cheese:** He needs 5 pounds of cheese too, 'cause he's making 5 sandwiches.
* **Meat cost:**  Meat costs $7.00 a pound, so he'll spend $7.00 * 5 pounds = $35.00

* **Total cost:**  He'll spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

"Okay, so they hired 40 people, right? And they pay them 15 dollars an hour for 40 hours a week.  So, that's 40 times 15, which is 600 dollars a week.  Then, in June, some of them, like a quarter, their contracts were up.  So, they had to pay 10 people.  That's 10 times 600, which is 6,000 dollars.  So, they paid 6,000 dollars in June.  And then, they paid 24,000 dollars in May.  So, the total is 6,000 plus 24,000, which is 30,000 dollars. 


**Answer:** 30,000

"Okay, so Shannon wants cookies for 30 days. She eats two cookies a night.  To figure out how many dozens she needs, we need to know how many cookies she needs in total.  So, she needs 30 days * 2 cookies/day = 60 cookies.  To get that many cookies, she needs 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens. 

**Answer:** 5

"Okay, so Joanne got 30 apples from the tall trees.  Her sister got twice as many from the tall trees, so she got 30 * 2 = 60 apples.  Joanne got half as many from the short trees as her sister, so she got 60 / 2 = 30 apples.  The sisters got a total of 500 apples.  So, Joanne got 30 + 30 + x = 60 + x apples.  We know that the sisters got 500 apples total, so 30 + 30 + x = 500.  Solving for x, we get x = 500 - 60 - 30 = 410. 


**Answer:** 410

"Okay, so we got camels and dromedaries, right?  They got heads and bumps.  We know there's 180 heads and 304 bumps.  We gotta figure out how many dromedaries there are.  

Here's the thing: camels got two bumps, and dromedaries got one.  So, we can use that to help us.

* **Heads:**  We know there's 180 heads.
* **Bumps:** We know there's 304 bumps.

"Kelly paid more.  

**Answer:** Kelly paid $1.00 more. 
"
"Okay, so we got 80 rooms.  Each room needs sheets, a comforter, pillowcases, and towels.  We need to count all that stuff up.  

* Sheets: 2 per room
* Comforter: 1 per room
* Pillowcases: 2 per room, so 4 pillowcases
* Towels: 8 per room, so 8 towels

So, that's 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 things per room.

Now we got 80 rooms, so we multiply that by 15: 15 things per room * 80 rooms = 1200 things.

**Answer:** 1200

"Okay, so Ashley brings 50 oranges, and Brianne brings 20 more. That's a lot of oranges!  They have 120 oranges in total.  To make pies, you need 3 oranges per pie. So, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies. 

**Answer:** 40

"Okay, so Mark wants to throw a party for his wife, right?  He's got two choices.  One is a flat fee, like $200, no matter how many people come.  The other one is $25 per person.  But here's the thing, the flat fee one doesn't have food, and Mark has to pay $5 for each person.  So, which one is cheaper?

Let's see...

* **Option 1:**  $200 + $5 * number of people
* **Option 2:** $25 * number of people

To figure out which one is cheaper, we need to find out how many people they both cost the same.  

So, we need to figure out how many people make the two options the same.

"Okay, so we know Bodhi found some bugs, right?  Let's say he found 'x' bugs. David found half of that, which is x/2.  Lily found 7 more than David, so she found x/2 + 7.  

Now, all together they found 43 bugs.  So, we can write that as an equation: x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43.  

Let's solve for x:

*  Combine the 'x's: 5x/2 + 7 = 43
*  Take away 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
*  Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
*  Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

Now we know Bodhi found 14.4 bugs.  To find out how many Lily found, we use the equation x/2 + 7.  So, that's 14.4/2 + 7.  

That's 7.2 + 7 = 14.2.  Lily found 14.2 bugs.

"Okay, so Ophelia has 20 sofas. Jenna has 3 times that many chairs, so Jenna has 20 * 3 = 60 chairs.  That means Jenna has 60 chairs.

So, together they have 58 + 60 = 118 sofas and chairs.

"Okay, so we got a bag of buttons, right?  Seven buttons had two holes, and the rest had four holes.  So, we gotta add up all the holes.  That's easy! 

* **Buttons with two holes:** 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes
* **Buttons with four holes:** 21 buttons - 7 buttons = 14 buttons
* **Total holes:** 14 holes + 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 14 + 56 = 70 holes

"Okay, so Mack saw birds every day, right?  He saw 50 on the first two days, then none on the third. Then he saw 120 on the fourth and fifth, and 20 on the sixth.  On the seventh day he saw 90.  So, how many birds did he see in total?  That's 50 + 50 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 330 birds.  He saw birds for 7 days, so he saw an average of 330 / 7 = 47.14 birds per day.

"Okay, so the jar has red, blue, and green jelly beans.  It says there's 1% less red than blue, and 1% more green than blue.  So, we gotta figure out how many of each there are.  

Let's say there are 'b' blue jelly beans.  That means there's 0.99 times as many red jelly beans, and 1.01 times as many green jelly beans.  

So, we know:

* Blue jelly beans = b
* Red jelly beans = 0.99b
* Green jelly beans = 1.01b

The total jelly beans is 4500.  We can put that in an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Now, we gotta solve for 'b'.  That's like figuring out how many jelly beans are in the jar.  

Let's do that! 

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500
2.99b = 4500
b = 1500

So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans.  

Now, we gotta figure out how many green jelly beans there are.

He made 80 dollars.

"Okay, so you want to know how long it takes for tires to wear out, right?  

Here's the thing:

*  They rotate 725 times every two miles.
*  Jeremy drives 400 miles.
*  Each tire can do 10,440,000 rotations.

So, we gotta figure out how many times the tires go round and round.  

*  Tires go round and round 725 times every two miles.
*  Jeremy drives 400 miles.
*  That's 725 times * 400 miles = 290,000 rotations.

Now, we gotta figure out how many times the tires go round and round in a year.

*  Tires go round and round 10,440,000 times a year.
*  We know Jeremy drives 400 miles.
*  That's 10,440,000 times a year / 400 miles = 26,100 rotations per year.

So, we gotta figure out how many years it takes for the tires to wear out.

*  We know the tires go round and round 26,100 times a year.
*  We know Jeremy drives 400 miles.
*  That's 26,100 times a year / 400 miles = 65.25 years.

So, it takes about 65.25 years for the tires to wear out.

"Okay, so the first guy had six ounces of steak.  Then the second guy had eight little beef tips, and each one was an ounce.  The third guy had a big steak that was a pound, which is like, a lot of steak!  The last two guys didn't eat meat, so we don't know how much they ate.  So, the total is... six plus eight plus a pound, which is a lot of meat!

"Okay, so we got 1000 people on the Reddit group.  They all post stuff, right?  So, they post 3 times a day, so that's 3000 posts a day.  That's a lot of posts!  In March, there are 31 days.  So, that's 3000 posts a day * 31 days = 93,000 posts.  That's a lot of posts! 

**Answer:** 93,000

"Okay, so we got 150 teachers on the court.  Sixty percent of them are history teachers, so that's 90.  The rest are math teachers, right?  So, we just need to figure out how many math teachers there are.  

Math teachers are the rest, so we have 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.  

Now, each math teacher sleeps for six hours.  So, we just multiply that by the number of math teachers.  That's 60 * 6 = 360 hours. 

**Answer:** 360 
"
"Okay, so we know Aurelia has $120.  Kassidy has a little bit more than that, like 3/4 of what Aurelia has.  So Kassidy has 3/4 * $120 = $90.  Rayna has 60 more than Kassidy, so she has $90 + $60 = $150.  If they all put their money together, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.  If they split it up equally, each person gets $360 / 3 = $120.

* Salt: 16 muffins * 0.25 tablespoons/muffin = 4 tablespoons
* Total: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132 tablespoons

So, Svetlana needs 132 tablespoons of stuff.

"Okay, so the bamboo is 20 feet tall now.  It grows 30 inches a day.  To get to 600 inches, we need to figure out how many days that is.  

*  20 feet is 20 * 12 = 240 inches.
*  We want to get to 600 inches.
*  So, we need to figure out how many days it takes to get 600 inches. 
*  600 inches / 30 inches a day = 20 days.

So it will take 20 days.

"Okay, so James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, right? That's 16 toys. Then he gets more dogs, like 8 more. So now he has 12 dogs.  Twice as many dogs as before, so that's 24 dogs.  He needs toys for all those dogs, so he needs 24 toys.  He buys some more toys, so he has 24 toys.  Then 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those toys anymore.

"Okay, so we got bananas, apples, and oranges.  Bananas cost twice as much as apples, and oranges are three times as much as bananas.  Apples cost $0.50 each, bananas cost twice that, so they cost $1.00 each.  Oranges are three times more than bananas, so they cost $3.00 each.  So, we got apples at $6.00, bananas at $5.00, and oranges at $21.00.  That's a total of $6.00 + $5.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.  

**Answer: $32.00**

"Okay, so Brittany has squares, right?  She has 14 red squares.  Then she has 4 more blue squares than red, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  Then she has 6 more green squares than blue, so that's 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  And then she has 12 fewer white squares than green, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  So, she has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  That means her comforter is 68 square feet. 

**Answer:** 68

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many points they need.  

* Adam got 50 points.
* Betty got more than Adam, like 30% more.  That's a lot!
* Marta got 3 times more than Tom, who's got 30 less than Betty. 

So, we gotta add all that up.  

* Betty got 65 points.
* Marta got 135 points.
* Tom got 30 points less than Betty, so he got 65 - 30 = 35 points.

That's a lot of points!  

* Total points: 50 + 65 + 135 + 35 = 255 points.

* They need 400 points to go on the trip.

* They are missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.

"Okay, so they make 50 quarts of vanilla every four hours.  That's like, a lot of ice cream!  And they make 100 quarts of chocolate in two hours.  So, if they make that much chocolate in two hours, they make 50 quarts every hour.  So, if they make 50 quarts every hour, in 48 hours, they make 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.  And they make 50 quarts of vanilla every four hours, so in 48 hours, they make 50 quarts per hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts.  So, they make 2400 quarts of chocolate and 2400 quarts of vanilla.  That's a lot of ice cream!  That's 2400 + 2400 = 4800 quarts. 

**Answer:** 4800

"Okay, so Marcus buys croissants, cinnamon rolls, mini quiches, and muffins.  He gets a discount, right?  Let's see...

* Croissants: 5 * 3.00 = 15.00
* Cinnamon Rolls: 4 * 2.50 = 10.00
* Mini Quiches: 3 * 4.00 = 12.00
* Muffins: 13 * 1.00 = 13.00

That's a total of 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 40.00

He gets a discount, so we take 40.00 and take off 4.00.  That's 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00

So the answer is 36.00.

"Okay, so Ron's car is gonna get messed up if that pothole isn't fixed.  The city is being mean and wants to fine him.  But he's gonna fix it himself.  He needs three buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs twenty-five bucks.  So that's three times twenty-five, which is seventy-five bucks.  Then he's gonna get fined one-two-zero for fixing it himself.  So, he's gonna spend a lot of money fixing it.  He's gonna lose money. 

**Answer:**  Ron loses money.

"Okay, so there's 60 slices of pizza.  Two friends eat 2/3, so that's 10 slices gone.  Then the other three eat 3/4, which is 15 slices.  So, how many are left?  

**Answer:** 35

"Okay, so the cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.  The dog eats them in 20 minutes.  That's a lot of sausages!  So, how long does it take them together?  Well, it's 30 minutes plus 20 minutes, which is 50 minutes.  So, the average time is 50 minutes. 

**Answer:** 25 
"
"Okay, so Topher's shoes are big!  He's got 'em big!  We gotta figure out Bobby's shoes.

* Topher's shoes are 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoes.  That's a lot of inches!
* We know Topher's shoes are 100 inches long.
* Let's say Bobby's shoes are 'x' inches long. 
* We can write that 100 = 9x + 10. 
* That means 9 times Bobby's shoes is 90 inches. 
* So, Bobby's shoes are 10 inches long.

"Okay, so they had 5000 people at the voting place.  Half of them voted by midday, right?  So that's 5000 / 2 = 2500 people.  Then, by 4 o'clock, half of the people who didn't vote yet voted.  So that's 2500 / 2 = 1250 people.  So, the rest of the people who didn't vote are 5000 - 2500 - 1250 = 1250.

* Ava gets more berries than Emma.
* Ava takes a little longer to finish the game.

To figure out who's better, we need to figure out how many points each one gets.

"Okay, so they got four pizzas, right? And they paid 64 dollars. Two of them cost 30 dollars. So, the other two cost the rest of the money, right?  So, 64 dollars - 30 dollars = 34 dollars. And 34 dollars divided by two pizzas is 17 dollars. 

**Answer:** 17 dollars 
"
"Okay, so they ride bikes three times a day for five days, that's fifteen times. Then, on two other days they ride twice as much, so that's six times.  That's a total of 15 + 6 = 21 times. 

**Answer:** 21

"Okay, so Bob had some fish, right?  He had 7 fish in total.  He got some more, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  So, how many white fish did he get? 

**Answer:** 10 
"
"Okay, so Andy's car goes 10 miles per gallon, right?  And gas is three dollars a gallon.  He drives to work every day, five miles each way.  So, how much gas does he use?  

*  He uses 5 miles / 10 miles per gallon = 0.5 gallons of gas each day.
*  That's 0.5 gallons * 5 days = 2.5 gallons a week.
*  That means he spends 2.5 gallons * 3 dollars a gallon = 7.5 dollars on gas.

"Okay, so they got $175,000 for the charity.  Some of that came from people and some from the people working.  The people working made $125,000.  So each person made $125,000 / 20 people = $6,250.

"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day, right? And then she walked for half as long the next day.  So, she walked for 4 hours.  That's a lot of walking!  To find the total time, we just add the two times together.  That's 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.  And 12 hours is a long time!  To make it easier, we need to convert that to minutes.  So, 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.  That's the answer! 


**Answer:** 720

"Okay, so Sasha played at home first, and she scored 14 points. Julie scored less, 4 less than Sasha, so she scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.  Then Sasha played at Julie's place, and she scored 6 less than Julie's first game, so she scored 10 - 6 = 4 points.  So, Sasha scored 14 + 4 = 18 points in the two games. 

**Answer:** 18

I think Becca has 153 cards.

"Okay, so the book is four pounds, right?  That's like, a big book!  It cost thirty-two dollars.  They charge you money to ship it, like, a dollar and forty cents for the weight and then some more for the miles.  And then they only give you back like, seventy-five percent of the money you spent.  So, how much will Milly lose? 

**Answer:**  Milly will lose twenty-one dollars.

"Okay, so he makes 50,000 bars a month.  He makes 8,000 in the first week.  Then he makes half as much the second week, so 4,000.  Then he makes three times as much the third week, so 24,000.  That's a lot of chocolate!  So, he makes 36,000 in the first three weeks.  To find out how much he makes in the fourth week, we take away the chocolate he made in the first three weeks from his total.  That's 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000.  So, he makes 14,000 in the fourth week.

* **Mirrors:** She's got 6 mirrors, and they cost $15 each to hang.  So that's 6 * $15 = $90.
* **Chandeliers:** She's got 2 chandeliers, and they cost $15 each to hang.  So that's 2 * $15 = $30.
* **Pictures:** She's got 20 pictures, and they cost $15 each to hang.  So that's 20 * $15 = $300.
* **Total:**  All that stuff costs $90 + $30 + $300 = $420. 


**Answer:** $420

"Okay, so he rides for four hours, right?  That's like, 8 miles per hour times four hours, so that's 32 miles. Then he takes a little break, and then he rides for six more hours. That's another 8 miles per hour times six hours, so that's 48 miles.  So, he rides a total of 32 miles plus 48 miles, which is 80 miles. 

**Answer:** 80

"Okay, so we got kangaroos going across the highway.  They take 18 hours.  We want to know how long it takes four turtles to do it.  

* Turtles are slower, right?  They go half as fast as the kangaroos. 
* So, we need to figure out how long it takes four turtles to go the same distance. 

Let's think about it.  If we know how long it takes one turtle, we can figure out how long it takes four turtles.

"Okay, so Kora made 20 dishes. Rory made 20 more than that, so that's 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so she made 2 times 40, which is 80 dishes.  All together, they made 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes. 

**Answer:** 140

"Okay, so we got three glue sticks.  One has some left, two has some left, and the last one has some left.  We need to find out how much glue is left on all of them.  

*  The first one has 1/6 left.
*  The second one has 2/3 left.
*  The third one has 1/2 left.

We need to add all that up to find out how much glue is left.  

* 1/6 + 2/3 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 = 4/3

Now we need to take that number and subtract it from the original length of the glue sticks.

* 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 12 mm - 4/3 mm

We need to figure out how to do that.  

* 12 mm - 4/3 mm = 36 mm - 4 mm = 32 mm

So the answer is 32 mm.

"Okay, so Jack has 60 dishes, right?  That's a lot of dishes!  He has twice as many as his socks.  So, Jack has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.  Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.  Together, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks.  Jack has 60 dishes, and Peter has 60 socks, so they have a total of 60 + 60 = 120 dishes.  So, they have a total of 90 + 120 = 210 socks and dishes.

"Okay, so you got three green baskets and three red baskets.  That's a lot of food!  

The red baskets cost $18 each, so you pay $18 * 3 = $54 for all the red baskets.  Then you get $2 off each red basket, so you pay $54 - $2 = $52 for the red baskets.

The green baskets cost $25 each, so you pay $25 * 3 = $75 for all the green baskets.

So, you pay $52 for the red baskets and $75 for the green baskets.  That's a total of $52 + $75 = $127.

"Okay, so we know 40 people came in and each gave Rafaela twenty dollars.  That's a lot of money!  Julieta got less, but we need to figure out how much she got.  So, Julieta got 90% of what Rafaela got.  That means she got 90 out of 100 dollars.  So, she got 0.90 times 20 dollars, which is 18 dollars.  Now, we need to add up Rafaela's money and Julieta's money.  That's 800 dollars plus 18 dollars, which is 818 dollars.

"Okay, so we know Sofie has more books than Anne, and Anne has less than Fawn.  Let's figure out how many books Fawn has.

* **Think about it like this:**  If we know Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 less than Fawn, we can figure out how many books Fawn has. 

* **Let's use a number:**  Let's say Fawn has 'F' books. 

* **Now, we can figure out how many books Anne has:** Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has 'F - 12' books.

* **And Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:** Sofie has 'F - 12 + 25' books.

* **Now we can put it all together:**  Fawn's books plus Anne's books plus Sofie's books equals 85. 

* **So, we have:** F + (F - 12) + (F - 12 + 25) = 85

* **Let's solve for F:** 3F + 13 = 85
* **Now we can find F:** 3F = 72
* **And finally:** F = 24

**Answer:** Fawn has 24 books.

"Okay, so Kelly's got bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples.  Bacon is ten bucks, and chicken is twice as much, so that's twenty bucks.  Strawberries are four bucks a pack, and she's got three packs.  Apples are half the price of strawberries, so they're two bucks a pack.  She's got seven packs of apples.  So, how much does all that cost?  Let's see...

* Bacon: 5 packs * $10/pack = $50
* Chicken: 6 packs * $20/pack = $120
* Strawberries: 3 packs * $4/pack = $12
* Apples: 7 packs * $2/pack = $14
* Total: $50 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $206

Kelly has $65 left.  So, she's got $65 - $206 = -$141.  That's not right.  She's broke!

**Answer:** 605 meters per second

"Okay, so he bakes a lot of mini cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins.  

* **Cinnamon rolls:** 200 of 'em!
* **Blueberry muffins:** 300 of 'em!

He makes mini versions of both, but they're smaller.  

* **Cinnamon rolls:**  They're like the regular ones, but smaller.
* **Blueberry muffins:**  They're like the regular ones, but smaller.

So, how many calories are in all of 'em? 

**Answer:** 85,000

"Okay, so she picks Junebugs every day.  Monday she gets 39.  Tuesday and Wednesday she gets twice as many as Monday, so that's 39 * 2 = 78.  Then Thursday she gets 48 and Friday 57.  That's a lot of bugs!  So, she gets 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 192 bugs.  That's a lot of bugs!  To find the average, we divide the total bugs by the number of days: 192 bugs / 5 days = 38.4 bugs per day.  

**Answer:** 38.4

"Okay, so she has a bunch of toys for her nephew.  She has 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 rings.  That's a lot of toys!  She got more toys, so she has 62.  To find out how many bouncy balls she got, we need to take the total toys and subtract the other toys.  So, 62 minus 48, that's 14 bouncy balls. 

**Answer:** 14 
"
"Okay, so we know the three people are 100 years old.  Let's think about it like this:

* **Peter is one of the people.**
* **Paul is older than John.**
* **Peter is the same age as Paul and John combined.**

So, we need to figure out Peter's age. 

**Here's how I think about it:**

* **Let's say Peter is P years old.**
* **Paul is P + 10 years old.**
* **John is J years old.**

Now, we know that:

* **P + P + J = 100**  (All three together are 100 years old)
* **P = P + 10 + J** (Peter's age is the same as Paul and John's combined)

**Let's solve for P:**

* **P + P + J = 100**
* **2P + J = 100**
* **J = 100 - 2P** (We can use this to find J)
* **P = P + 10 + J** (We can use this to find P)

**Now, we can use the equation J = 100 - 2P to find P.** 

**But wait!**  I think I got it!

"Okay, so Zoey has 40 seeds and she throws 'em 10 feet each.  Sydney has 35 seeds and throws 'em 12 feet each.  To find out who throws the most seeds, we gotta add up how far they throw all their seeds.  Zoey throws 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.  Sydney throws 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.  So, together they throw 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.  That's a lot of seeds!  To find out the average, we divide the total distance by how many people are throwing.  So, 820 feet / 2 people = 410 feet.  That's the answer! 


**Answer:** 410

"Okay, so we gotta figure out which machine makes more money. Widgeteer makes 60 widgets an hour, and WidgetMaster makes 45.  

* Widgeteer: 60 * 24 * 30 = $43,200
* WidgetMaster: 45 * 24 * 30 = $32,400

Widgeteer makes more money! 

**Answer:** Widgeteer

"Okay, so he stays for 12 hours, right? That's 12 hours.  He pays 1000 pesos for that.  Then he stays for another 12 hours, so he pays 1600 pesos.  But he only pays for 12 hours, so he saves 1600 - 1000 = 600 pesos. 


**Answer:** 600

"Okay, so we got goats and sheep, right? Goats need 5 pounds each, and sheep need less.  We gotta figure out how much hay we need for all of them. 

* **Goats:** 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds
* **Sheep:** 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds
* **Total:** 75 pounds + 84 pounds = 159 pounds

So, we need 159 pounds of hay. 


**Answer:** 159

"Okay, so John works for 6 hours and makes 50 dollars an hour. That's 50 dollars * 6 hours = 300 dollars.  He spends 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 dollars - 50 dollars = 250 dollars left.  He wants to put 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 dollars - 100 dollars = 150 dollars left.  He wants to buy pens, and each pen is 25 dollars.  So, he can buy 150 dollars / 25 dollars/pen = 6 pens.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many Pokemon Stan caught.  

We know Alex has 5 more than Stan, and Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.  

Let's think about it like this:

* **Alex:**  We don't know how many he caught, but we know he has 5 more than Stan.
* **Stan:**  We don't know how many he caught, but we know he has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch.
* **Adelwolfe:**  We don't know how many he caught, but we know he caught a bunch!

So, we need to figure out how many Pokemon Adelwolfe caught.  

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'W' Pokemon.  Then Stan caught 4 times that amount minus 13.  

Stan caught 4 times Adelwolfe's catch minus 13.  

We also know Alex caught 5 more than Stan.

"Okay, so Adam got some new pants. His mom gave him six dollars, and his dad gave him twice that much, so he got twelve dollars from his dad.  Then, he had to use some of his own money, so he had to pay for the pants with some of his own money.  He had to pay $30 for the pants, and he got $18 from his parents, so he had to pay $30 - $18 = $12 from his own money.

So, the lawyer is gonna give him $6000 - $200 = $5800.

"Okay, so there were 100 people at the wedding, and they all brought cookies.  The bride gave half of the cookies to the church.  So, the church got 750 cookies.  To figure out how many people were in the church, we need to divide the cookies by how many cookies each person got.  That's 750 cookies / 15 cookies per person = 50 people. 


**Answer:** 50

"Okay, so Doctor Jones is at the clinic for nine hours. He has to check on patients and make appointments.  He checks on patients for a long time, and then he has to make appointments.  How much time does he have left to do his other stuff? 

* **A.** 60 minutes
* **B.** 90 minutes
* **C.** 120 minutes
* **D.** 180 minutes

"Okay, so the cake needs to be done by 5 o'clock.  Let's see...

*  Making the batter takes 20 minutes.
*  Baking takes 30 minutes.
*  It needs to cool for two hours, which is 120 minutes.
*  Frosting takes 10 minutes.

So, all that adds up to 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

To figure out when to start, we need to subtract the total time from 5 o'clock.  That's 5 - 180 = 1:00.

So, Jordan needs to start making the cake at 1:00. 


**Answer:** 1:00 pm

"Okay, so Lisa and Peter sold chocolate bars, right?  They sold a lot of them!  They sold 64 of them together.  We know they sold them in boxes, but how many bars are in each box?  Let's think about it. 

Lisa sold 3 and a half boxes, and Peter sold 4 and a half boxes.  That's a lot of boxes!  So, we need to figure out how many bars are in each box. 

If we add up all the boxes, we get 8 boxes.  So, we know that each box has 8 chocolate bars.

"Okay, so the dance studio charges $25 to rent it and then $1.50 for each student.  So, they get $1.50 for each student.  They have 10 students, so that's $15.00.  They do it three days a week, so that's 3 days * 4 weeks = 12 days.  So, they make $40 per day, and they do it 12 days a month.  That's $480. 

**Answer:** $480

"Okay, so we know there are 50 porcupines.  Half of them are girls, so that's 30 girls.  Each girl has babies, and they have 4 babies each.  So, in a year, they have a lot of babies!  That's 120 babies.  So, we add all the girls and babies to see how many there are.  That's 50 plus 120, which is 170 porcupines! 


**Answer:** 170 
"
"Okay, so the pool is big, right?  It's 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.  To figure out how much water they need, we gotta multiply those numbers together.  So, 14 feet times 25 feet times 4 feet.  That's a lot of water!  Then we gotta multiply that by 7.48 because that's how many gallons are in a cubic foot.  So, that's gonna be a lot of gallons!  And then we gotta multiply that by 10 cents a gallon.  That's gonna be a lot of money!  So, the answer is $1039.20.

"Okay, so they got 9 red sticks.  Then they got 5 more blue sticks, so that's 9 plus 5, which is 14 blue sticks.  And then they got 11 yellow sticks, 'cause 14 minus 3 is 11.  So, all together they got 9 plus 14 plus 11, which is 34 sticks.

"Okay, so we know half the students are over 16. That's 3000 / 2 = 1500.  Half of those are boys, so that's 1500 / 4 = 375 boys.  The rest are girls, so that's 1500 - 375 = 1125.  Half of the girls are girls, so that's 1125 / 2 = 562.5.  Wait, that's not a whole number!  So, there are 562 girls.

"Bethany runs more laps than Quinn.  

**Answer:** 5 
"
"Okay, so the tank is big, like 18,000 gallons big.  Wanda and Ms. B work together to fill it.  They do it over two days.  Wanda fills a part of the tank each day.  

**Day 1:** Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank.  Ms. B fills more, but not as much as Wanda.  

**Day 2:** Wanda fills a little more than she did on day 1.  Ms. B fills a little less than she did on day 1.

"Okay, so we got 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, right?  They mine a lot of ore!  

*  Each dwarf mines 18 pounds a day.

That's a lot of ore!

"Okay, so Sally had a bunch of balloons.  She had 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow.  Then some wind blew some of the red ones, and she let go of some of the yellow ones.  Then she found some blue ones in a tree and added them to her balloons.  So, how many balloons did she have?

"Okay, so here's what I think:

*  There's a chance the teacher won't give him homework.  That's like 50%.
*  Even if the teacher doesn't give him homework, there's a chance she'll give him an extension. That's like 40%.
*  If the teacher doesn't give him an extension, there's a chance he can say his dog ate it. That's like 20%.

So, to figure out if he has to do the homework, we have to think about all the chances.  

* **He might not have to do it:** 50% chance of no homework, 40% chance of an extension, and 20% chance of a dog eating it. 
* **He might have to do it:** 100% - 20% = 80% chance of having to do it. 

So, the chance of him having to do the homework is 80%.

"Okay, so Monday they sent 425 letters.  Tuesday they sent more than one-fifth of that, which is 425 / 5 = 85. Then they sent 17 more than that, so it was 85 + 17 = 102.  Wednesday they sent 5 more than twice that, which is 102 * 2 = 204.  Then they sent 5 more than that, so it was 204 + 5 = 209.  So, all together they sent 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Okay, so he got 19 balls total.  We know he got some in the first set, and some in the second and third.

"Okay, so he sells milkshakes, burgers, and sodas.  How much does he make? 

* Milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50 each = $33.00
* Burgers: 9 platters * $11 each = $99.00
* Sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50 each = $30.00

That's a lot of money!  He makes $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00 

**Answer:** $162.00

"So, the guy bought the watch for 75% of the price, right?  Then he sold it for 120% of what he paid.  That means he made a good deal!  To figure out the discount, we need to see how much he paid less than the original price.  He paid $1500, and then sold it for $1800.  That's $300 more!  So, the discount is $300.  That's 10% of the original price. 

**Answer:** 10%

"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence. Harry gets more than Sam, but how much?  Let's see...

* Sam has some fence, let's say it's 'x' feet.
* Harry gets more, so he has 'x + 60' feet.
* Together, they have 100 feet.

So, we can say: x + (x + 60) = 100

Let's solve it:
* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

So, Sam has 20 feet.  Harry has 20 + 60 = 80 feet.

Harry has 80 feet, and Sam has 20 feet.  How much is left over for Sam? 

**Answer:** 20

"Okay, so we got red balls, blue balls, and green balls.  We gotta count 'em up!  Red balls cost nine dollars each, blue balls cost five dollars each, and green balls cost three dollars each.  So, we got 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls.  That's a lot of balls!  We gotta add up all the money we get from 'em.  Red balls are nine dollars each, so we got 3 times nine, which is 27 dollars.  Blue balls are five dollars each, so we got 11 times five, which is 55 dollars.  And green balls are three dollars each, so we got 25 times three, which is 75 dollars.  So, all together, we got 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 dollars.  That's a lot of money! 

**Answer:** 157

"Okay, so it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.  That's how many times it blinks in 5 minutes.  So, to figure out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we just need to figure out how long it takes to blink that many times. 

*  Think about it like this: if it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, then it blinks 459 times in 5 minutes. 

So, it takes 9 minutes.

"Okay, so Melanie's dad gets more cows and chickens every day for three weeks.  That's a lot of animals!  He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  He gets 20 more cows each day for three weeks, so that's 20 * 21 = 420 cows.  He also gets 10 more chickens each day for three weeks, so that's 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.  So, he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.  That's a lot of animals!  He has 470 cows and 230 chickens.  That's a total of 470 + 230 = 700 animals.

"Okay, so Sid drove 110 miles in two hours, then another 140 miles in three hours.  That's a lot of miles!  To find his average speed, we need to figure out how fast he was going.  

To do that, we need to know how long he was driving.  He drove for two hours the first time and three hours the second time.  That's a total of five hours.

Now, we need to figure out how many miles he drove in those five hours.  He drove 110 miles in two hours and 140 miles in three hours.  That's a total of 250 miles.

So, to find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time.  That's 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

**Answer: 50**

"Okay, so you got two tickets, one is a 20% chance and the other is 60%.  To get both to win, you gotta multiply the chances.  So, 20% times 60% is 12%.  That's the answer.

"The cassette has 5 minutes of music and another song that's longer.  That longer song is 60% longer.  So, the longer song is 5 minutes * 1.60 = 8 minutes.  The total time is 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes. 

**Answer:** 13 minutes

"Okay, so he bought two phones for $20 each, right?  He sold them for twice the price, so he made $40 each.  He did that for two days, so he made $80. Then he did it again for four phones, so he made $160.  So, he made $80 + $160 = $240. 

**Answer:** $240

"Okay, so we need to figure out how many more juice bottles Hortex needs to make.  

* We know they make 4200 bottles a day.
* Each bottle helps 20% of one person's energy needs.
* We need to help 2300 people.

"Okay, so the avocado tree starts small, right?  It makes 50 fruits when it's five years old.  Then it gets bigger, and it makes more fruits each year.  

* **Year 6:** It makes three times as many as the first year, so 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
* **Year 7:** It makes seven times as many as the first year, so 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.
* **Year 8:** It makes 150 less than the year before, so 350 - 200 = 150 fruits.
* **Year 9:**  It doesn't make any fruits.
* **Year 10:** It makes 20 times as many as the first year, so 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.

So, all together, the tree makes 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = 2250 fruits.

"Okay, so we got three ropes.  We know the yellow one is the longest.  The blue one is shorter than the yellow one, and the red one is four times longer than the blue one.  We know all the ropes together are 37 centimeters long.  

So, how do we find the length of the red rope? 

* **A.**  We need to figure out how long the yellow rope is first.
* **B.**  We need to figure out how long the blue rope is first.
* **C.**  We need to figure out how long the red rope is first.

Let's try to figure out the yellow rope first.  We know the yellow rope is the longest, and the blue rope is shorter than the yellow rope.  We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  

We know all the ropes together are 37 centimeters long.  So, we can use that to figure out the length of the yellow rope.

"Okay, so we know the mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.  Half the mural is yellow, so that's 6 pints.  And the red, white, and purple are all the same amount, so we need to figure out how much of each color is in the mural.  We know the total is 12 pints, so each color is 12 pints / 4 colors = 3 pints.  So, the red paint is 3 pints. 

**Answer:** 18

"Okay, so she counts clouds every day.  

* Monday: 3 clouds
* Tuesday: Double that, so 3 * 2 = 6 clouds
* Wednesday: Double that again, so 6 * 2 = 12 clouds
* Thursday: Double that, so 12 * 2 = 24 clouds
* Friday: Double that, so 24 * 2 = 48 clouds

So, she counts 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 91 clouds. 

**Answer:** 91

"Okay, so the teacher used a lot of chalk on Monday.  He used 45% of it.  He uses 20% each day, so he used 45% / 20% = 2.25 times the amount of chalk he normally uses.  That means he has 1 / 2.25 = 0.44 times the amount of chalk left.  He can use that for 0.44 / 0.20 = 2.2 days.  So, he can use it for 2 days.

"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted some trees.  He planted 20 White Oak trees the first day.  He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.  That's a lot of trees!  On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees.  That's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees and 40 * 1/4 = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees.  So he planted 30 + 10 = 40 more Lodgepole Pine trees.  That's a lot of trees!  He planted a total of 60 trees the first day and 80 trees the second day.  That's 60 + 80 = 140 trees! 


**Answer:** 140

"Okay, so Fred had 24 gallons of root beer.  Then his kids drank some, and then Barbie spilled some, and then Ronnie took some more.  So, how much is left?  

* 24 - 4 = 20 gallons
* 20 - 7 = 13 gallons
* 13 - 5 = 8 gallons

And then, three people came over for the party.  So, how much root beer do they get?

* 8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out how many mugs are in the teacher's lounge.  

We know this: eight more than four times the number of mugs is forty.  

So, let's think about it like this:

* Four times the number of mugs is like... four times something.
* Eight more than that is like... four times something plus eight.
* And that whole thing equals forty.

So, we gotta figure out what that ""something"" is.  

Let's try to make it easy:

*  Let's say ""something"" is ""x"". 
*  Four times ""x"" is 4x.
*  Eight more than that is 4x + 8.
*  And that whole thing equals forty.

So, we gotta solve for ""x"".  

* 4x + 8 = 40
* Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 8

So, there are **8** mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Okay, so we got 66 fish.  One-third of them have red stripes, so that's 66 / 3 = 22 fish.  Then, the rest don't have red stripes, right?  So, that's 66 - 22 = 44 fish.  And, 5 out of 11 of the rest have blue stripes, so that's 44 * 5 / 11 = 20 fish.  So, 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish.  That's the answer!

That's like 250%!

"Okay, so Rose bought a lot of eggs.  She got 60 eggs.  She wants to sell them for a dollar each.  She can sell 60 eggs / 3 eggs per dollar = 20 dollars.  But she spent 144 dollars on the eggs.  So she made 20 dollars and spent 144 dollars.  She lost 144 - 20 = 124 dollars.

"Okay, so Tim wants to make lemonade for a party.  He needs 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon needs 1 cup of lemon juice.  He wants to make an extra gallon, and he wants it to be twice as tart.  So, he needs to make 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.  He needs to make 8 cups of juice for the extra gallon.  He needs 8 cups / 6 lemons/cup = 1.33 lemons.  He can't have a fraction of a lemon, so he needs to buy 1 more lemon.  So, he needs 1 lemon + 6 lemons = 7 lemons.

"Okay, so we got three German Shepherds and two Bulldogs.  They eat food, right?  So we gotta figure out how much food they eat in a week.  

* German Shepherds eat 5 kilos a day.
* Bulldogs eat 3 kilos a day.

So, in a week, they eat 5 kilos a day * 7 days = 35 kilos.
And the Bulldogs eat 3 kilos a day * 7 days = 21 kilos.

That's a total of 35 kilos + 21 kilos = 56 kilos of food. 

**Answer:** 56 
"
"Okay, so we got 10 animals with two legs and 15 animals with four legs.  That's a lot of legs!  So, we add them up.  We got 20 legs from the two-legged ones and 60 legs from the four-legged ones.  That's a total of 80 legs. 

**Answer:** 80 
"
"Okay, so we know there are 4 blue blocks.  Twice that many yellow blocks is 4 * 2 = 8.  That's a lot of yellow blocks!  So, we have 4 + 8 = 12 blocks that are blue and yellow.  The rest of the blocks are red.  We know there are 32 blocks total, so we can find out how many red blocks there are by doing 32 - 12 = 20. 

**Answer:** 20 
"
"Okay, so Elvis drives west for five hours, right?  Then he goes east for eight hours.  That's a long drive!  He's probably tired.  

To figure out how far he is from home, we need to know how far he went in each direction.  He went 90 miles west and 144 miles east.  That's a lot of miles!  

So, he's probably a long way from home now.  

**Answer: 234 miles**

"Okay, so the boat cost $9000.  It lost 30% of its value the first year, so it's worth $6300. Then it lost another 30% the second year, so it's worth $4410.  And then it lost 20% the third year, so it's worth $3528. 

**Answer:** $3528 
"
"Okay, so we know there's a big bag of candy.  It's got 232 pieces.  Red is 54, and orange is twice that, so that's 54 * 2 = 108.  Then yellow is half the red, so that's 54 / 2 = 27.  So, all the red, orange, and yellow is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.  That leaves us with 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies. 

**Answer:** 43 
"
"Okay, so Helen went to Germany for three nights. She took the bus a lot, like seven times!  One night at the hotel was $80.  Each bus ride was like ten percent of that price, so each trip was $8.  She took the bus seven times, so that was $56.  The hotel was $80 a night for three nights, so that was $240.  So, the whole trip cost $296. 

**Answer:** $296

"Okay, so they go to the movies, right?  They got a grown-up ticket for 12 dollars and a kid's ticket for 8 dollars.  Then they buy two bags of popcorn, and each bag is three dollars.  So, how much do they spend in total? 

*  A: 12 + 8 + 6 = 26 dollars

"Okay, so the car is heavy, right?  It's got a lot of stuff in it.  We gotta push it, so we need to know how much force we need.  

*  The car is 1200 pounds.
*  Then there's stuff in it, 250 pounds.
*  And the kids are 75 pounds each, so that's 150 pounds.
*  So the whole car is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.
*  To move it, we need 1% of that weight, so we need 1600 * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

**Answer:** 16 pounds

"Okay, so he's got a fence that's 20 feet long and 15 feet wide.  To figure out how much paper he needs, we gotta add up all the sides.  That's like, two times the long side plus two times the short side.  So, 2 times 20 plus 2 times 15.  That's 40 plus 30.  That's 70 feet! 


**Answer:** 70 feet

"Okay, so Mia is younger than Emma, and they are 16 years apart. Mia is 40 years old.  So Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.  The average of their ages is 40 + 56 / 2.  That's 40 + 56 / 2 = 48. 

**Answer:** 48

"Okay, so Avery needs plates and bowls for 12 people.  That's a lot of people!  

* Dinner plates cost $6 each.
* Bowls cost $5 each.
* Salad plates cost $4 each.

So, how much will it cost?  Let's see...

* Dinner plates: 12 people * 3 plates per person = 36 plates
* Bowls: 12 people * 3 plates per person = 36 bowls
* Salad plates: 12 people * 3 plates per person = 36 plates

That's a lot of plates and bowls!  

* Dinner plates: 36 plates * $6.00/plate = $216.00
* Bowls: 36 bowls * $5.00/bowl = $180.00
* Salad plates: 36 plates * $4.00/plate = $144.00

That's a lot of money!  

**Answer:** $540.00

"Okay, so John wants to have a party.  He's got 20 people coming.  Each one eats two hot dogs.  He's got some left over, but not enough.  He needs to buy more.  How many hot dogs does he need?  

* 20 people * 2 hot dogs/person = 40 hot dogs
* He has 4 left over, so he needs 40 - 4 = 36 more.
* He needs to buy 36 hot dogs.  
* How much does that cost?  
* Each pack has 6 hot dogs and costs $2.  
* 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs
* 6 packs * $2/pack = $12. 

**Answer:** $12

"Mamou has 1218 meals left to give out. 
"
"Okay, so he got a quarter, two nickels, and seven dimes.  That's a lot of change!  

* Quarter: 25 cents
* Nickels: 2 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 10 cents
* Dimes: 7 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 70 cents

That's a total of 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents. 

**Answer:** 105 cents

"Okay, so there's two brothers and three sisters.  The sisters are all the same age, right?  So they're all 16.  One brother is 12, and that's half the age of the other brother.  So, the other brother is 24.  The sisters are 16 * 3 = 48 years old.  The total age of all the kids is 12 + 48 = 60.

"Okay, so we got a small sunflower with 3 dozen seeds.  That's 3 times 12, which is 36 seeds.  The big sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small one, so it has 36 + (36 * 0.50) = 54 seeds.  So, together they have 36 + 54 = 90 seeds. 

**Answer:** 90

**Answer:** $140,000 
"
"Okay, so Jake buys two T-shirts, and they're 50% off. That means they cost half price, right? So two T-shirts cost $8 * 2 = $16.  Then Jake gets shoes, and they're 40% off.  That means they cost $40 * 0.40 = $16 less. So the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.  So Jake spends $16 + $24 = $40.

"Okay, so Ryan gets $6 a week for chores, and he did them for three weeks, so he got $6 * 3 = $18. Then he bought ice cream for his friends, and it cost $1.25 per person, so that was $1.25 * 3 = $3.75.  And the tickets are $6.50 each, so how many can he buy?  Let's see... $21.75 (the total cost of the ice cream and chores) / $6.50 (the cost of each ticket) = 3.3.  He can't buy a part of a ticket, so he can buy **3** tickets. 



**Answer:** 3

"Okay, so we got quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.  Let's see...

* **Quarters:**  We got 32 of 'em, and each one is worth $0.25.  So that's 32 times $0.25, which is $8.00.
* **Dimes:** We got 95 of 'em, and each one is worth $0.10.  So that's 95 times $0.10, which is $9.50.
* **Nickels:** We got 120 of 'em, and each one is worth $0.05.  So that's 120 times $0.05, which is $6.00.
* **Pennies:** We got 750 of 'em, and each one is worth $0.01.  So that's 750 times $0.01, which is $7.50.

So, all together, it's $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $29.00.

"Okay, so you want to know how many oranges they peel.  

* Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
* Jane takes 4 minutes.

So, if they both start at the same time, they'll peel the same amount of oranges.

"Okay, so the radiator is $400, but he gets it for 80% off, so it's only $320. Then he has to pay a mechanic to put it in, and it takes three hours, and the mechanic charges $50 an hour. So, it's $150 for the mechanic.  So, he pays $320 + $150 = $470. 

**Answer:** $470

"Okay, so we know there are 20 animals on the farm.  They're all chickens or cows.  We know they have 70 legs.  

Let's think about it:

* Chickens have 2 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs.

So, we need to figure out how many chickens there are.  

**Here's how we can do it:**

* Let's say there are 'c' chickens.
* Then there are 'w' cows.

We know:

* c + w = 20 (all the animals together)
