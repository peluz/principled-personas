"Josh's investment in the house is a bit of a gamble.  Here's how to break down the situation:

* **Initial Investment:** The house cost Josh $80,000.
* **Repairs:** He spent an additional $50,000 on repairs.
* **Value Increase:** The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%.  This means the house is now worth 1.5 times its original price.

To find the profit, we need to calculate the difference between the value of the house after repairs and the initial investment.

**Profit = (Value After Repairs - Initial Investment)**

Let's plug in the numbers:

**Profit = ($120,000 - $130,000)**

**Profit = -$10,000**

"To find the total amount of feed needed for the final meal, we need to consider the total feed given in the morning and afternoon.  

The total feed given is 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups. 

Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, we can calculate the total feed needed for all chickens by dividing the total feed given by the number of chickens: 40 cups / 20 chickens = 2 cups per chicken.

Therefore, the final meal needs to provide 2 cups of feed per chicken, which is 2 cups * 20 chickens = 40 cups. 


**Answer:** 40

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Cost of a single glass:** $5
* **Discount on each second glass:** 60% of $5 = $3
* **Cost of 16 second glasses:** 16 * $3 = $48
* **Total cost of all glasses:** 16 * $5 = $80

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $80 for 16 glasses. 


**Answer:** $80

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Seattle's sheep:** We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
* **Charleston's sheep:** Charleston has 4 times the sheep of Seattle, so it has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
* **Toulouse's sheep:** Toulouse has twice the sheep of Charleston, meaning it has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
* **Total sheep:**  To find the total, add the sheep from each city: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep.

Therefore, the total number of sheep is 260.

"Let's break down the download time. 

First, we need to figure out how much of the file Carla has already downloaded.  40% of 200 GB is (40/100) * 200 GB = 80 GB.

Next, we need to calculate the time spent downloading the initial 80 GB.  This is 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, we need to account for the restart.  This adds 20 minutes to the total time.

Finally, we need to calculate the remaining portion of the file. This is 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.

The remaining portion of the file is then downloaded at a rate of 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Therefore, the total download time is 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes. 


**Answer: 120 minutes**

"Let's break down the problem using a few key variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the distance from home.
*  Let 't' represent the time spent driving.

We know the following:

* **First leg:**  Distance = Speed * Time  
   *  180 miles = 60 mph * t 
* **Second leg:** Distance = Speed * Time
   *  320 miles = 80 mph * (t + 2 hours) 
* **Traffic:**  Distance = Speed * Time
   *  30 miles = 30 mph * 1 hour

**Solving for 't'**

We can use the information from the second leg to solve for 't'. 

* 320 miles = 80 mph * (t + 2 hours)
* 320 miles = 80 mph * (t + 2 hours)
* 320 miles = 80 mph * t + 160 miles
* 320 - 160 = 80 mph * t
* 160 miles = 80 mph * t
* t = 2 hours

**Calculating the final distance**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 80 mph * 2 hours
* Distance = 160 miles

**Final Answer:** 160 miles

"Let's break down Eliza's earnings. 

* **Regular pay:**  Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours she works, so her regular pay is 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.
* **Overtime pay:**  She works 5 additional hours at a rate of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, which is 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour.  Her overtime pay is 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.
* **Total earnings:**  To find her total earnings, we add her regular pay and overtime pay: $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.

"The program had 60 downloads in the first month.  In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month's downloads, so there were 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.  In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30%, which is 0.3 * 180 = 54 downloads.  Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

"Let's break down the cost of Toula's pastries:

* **Donuts:** 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen cost 3 * 68 = $204
* **Mini Cupcakes:** 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen cost 2 * 80 = $160
* **Mini Cheesecakes:** 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen cost 6 * 55 = $330

Adding these costs together, we get $204 + $160 + $330 = $694.

Therefore, the total cost of Toula's pastries is $694.

"To determine the number of years it takes for Carlos to start earning money, we need to find the time it takes for his annual profit to exceed his annual expenses. 

Let's represent the number of years as 'x'.  

* **Earnings:**  The tree generates $10.50 per year in profit.
* **Expenses:** The tree costs $3.00 per year to water and feed.

We want to find the value of 'x' when the profit is greater than the expenses.  

The equation representing this is:

Profit = Earnings - Expenses

$7.50 (profit) = $10.50 (earnings) - $3.00 (expenses)

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

Let 'x' represent the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.  

* She sold (1/3)x at the green house.
* She sold (5/3)x at the red house (2 more than the green house).
* She sold (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - (5/3)x) at the orange house (half of what was left).

We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:

x - (1/3)x - (5/3)x + (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - (5/3)x) = 5

Simplifying the equation:

(2/3)x - (5/3)x = 5

Combining like terms:

(-1/3)x = 5

Solving for x:

x = 5 * (-3)

x = -15

"Let's break down this problem.  We know the book was discounted by 25%, meaning the sale price is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).  

We can set up an equation to solve for the original price:

* Let 'x' represent the original price.
* The sale price is 0.75x (75% of the original price).

We know the sale price is $19.50, so:

* 0.75x = $19.50

Now, solve for x:

* Divide both sides by 0.75: x = $19.50 / 0.75 
* Calculate: x = $26.00

**Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.**

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios and algebraic equations.

**Understanding the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:11 represents the relationship between Darrell and Allen's ages. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years.

**Setting up the Equation:**

Let's use variables to represent their current ages:

* Let Darrell's current age be represented by '7x'
* Let Allen's current age be represented by '11x'

We know their total age is 162, so we can set up an equation: 7x + 11x = 162

**Solving for x:**

* Combine like terms: 18x = 162
* Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

**Calculating Allen's Age in 10 Years:**

Now that we know Darrell's current age (7x = 7 * 9 = 63), we can find Allen's age in 10 years:

* Allen's age in 10 years will be 11x + 10 = 11 * 9 + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109

**Answer:** Allen's age in 10 years will be 109.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 's' represent the number of silver coins.
* Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver, the number of gold coins is 's + 30'.
* The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold: s + (s + 30) = 110

Now, we can solve for 's':

* Combine like terms: 2s + 30 = 110
* Subtract 30 from both sides: 2s = 80
* Divide both sides by 2: s = 40

To find the number of gold coins, substitute the value of 's' back into the expression 's + 30':

* 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins. 


"
"Let's break down the problem using variables:

* Let 'A' represent the number of jewels Aaron has.
* Let 'R' represent the number of jewels Raymond has.
* Let 'S' represent the number of jewels Siobhan has.

We are given the following information:

*  S = A - 2  (Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron)
*  A = R + 5  (Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels)
*  R = 40 (Raymond has 40 jewels)

Now, let's substitute the value of R into the second equation:

* A = 40 + 5 
* A = 45

Finally, substitute the value of A into the first equation:

* S = 45 - 2
* S = 43

Therefore, Siobhan has **43** jewels.

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach. 

* **Let 'r' represent Dana's walking speed.** 
* **Let 'r' also represent Dana's running speed.**

We know:

* Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, so:  r = 4*r
* Dana skips at half the speed of her run, so her skipping speed is r/2.

We are given that she skips at 3 miles per hour.  This means:

* r/2 = 3 miles/hour

Solving for 'r', we get:

* r = 6 miles/hour

Now, let's consider the time Dana spends on each activity:

* **Running:** Dana runs for 2 hours.
* **Walking:** Dana walks for 4 hours.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to consider the distance covered in each activity and add them together.

* **Distance running:** 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles
* **Distance walking:** 3 miles/hour * 4 hours = 12 miles

Finally, the total distance traveled is:

* 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles


**Answer:** Dana can travel 24 miles in six hours.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
* She used 220 notes at work.
* She has 23 notes remaining.

To find the total number of notes she had before going to work, we can use the following equation:

Total notes = Notes in purse + Notes used

Let 'x' represent the number of notes in the package she bought.  We can set up the equation:

80 + x = 243

Now, solve for x:

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let 'b' represent the cost of one blue tie.  Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can represent the cost of one red tie as 'b + 0.50b = 1.50b'.

We know John bought 5 blue ties at $40 each, so the total cost of blue ties is 5 * $40 = $200.

We also know John bought 10 red ties at a cost of 1.50b each, so the total cost of red ties is 10 * 1.50b = 15b.

The total cost of all ties is the sum of the cost of blue and red ties, which is $200 + 15b = $800.

To find the value of 'b', we can solve the equation:

$200 + 15b = $800
15b = $600
b = $600 / 15
b = $40

Now that we know the cost of one blue tie, we can find the cost of one red tie:

1.50b = 1.50 * $40 = $60

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of all ties:

$600 (red) + $200 (blue) = $800


**Answer:** $800

"To find the number of unoccupied units, we first need to determine the total number of units in the building.  Since there are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units, the total number of units is 15 * 8 = 120.

Next, we need to calculate the number of occupied units.  We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied, so we can find the number of occupied units by multiplying the total number of units by 3/4: 120 * (3/4) = 90.

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30.

Therefore, there are **30** unoccupied units in the building.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Comic Books:** Uriah removes 30 comic books, and each weighs 1/4 pound.  To find the total weight of the comic books, we multiply the number of comic books by their weight: 30 comic books * (1/4 pound/comic book) = 7.5 pounds.
* **Total Weight:** Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds in total.  We subtract the weight of the comic books from the total weight: 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.
* **Toys:**  The weight of the toys is 7.5 pounds. To find the number of toys, we divide the total weight of the toys by the weight of each toy: 7.5 pounds / (1/2 pound/toy) = 15 toys.

"The sequence of square footage for Luke's sandcastles is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 1/2.  

To find the average square footage, we can use the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:

* S = sum of the series
* a = first term (in this case, 16)
* r = common ratio (1/2)
* n = number of terms (in this case, 4)

Plugging in the values:

S = 16 (1 - (1/2)^4) / (1 - 1/2)
S = 16 (1 - 1/16) / (1/2)
S = 16 (15/16) / (1/2)
S = 15

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 15.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We know Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's.  After Gerald improves his diet, he runs the hurdles 10% faster.  We need to find Gerald's new time.

**Setting up the Equation:**

Let's represent Gerald's original time as 'x' seconds.  Since Lee is 2 seconds faster, Lee's time is 'x + 2' seconds.

**Solving for Gerald's New Time:**

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're given information about Adrien and Lylah's salaries over time.  We need to find their combined salary four years later.

**Key Information:**

* Adrien's initial salary: $40,000
* Adrien's salary increase: 40%
* Lylah's initial salary:  We need to find this.
* Adrien's salary four years later: $56,000
* Lylah's salary four years later: We need to find this.

**Solving the Problem:**

1. **Adrien's salary four years later:**  We know Adrien's salary increased by 40% of his initial salary.  This means his salary now is 1.40 times his initial salary. 
   * Adrien's salary now = $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000

2. **Lylah's salary four years later:**  We know Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.  Let's represent Lylah's initial salary as 'x'.  
   * Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30
   * $56,000 = x * 1.30

3. **Solving for Lylah's initial salary (x):**
   * x = $56,000 / 1.30 = $43,077 (approximately)

4. **Lylah's salary four years later:**  We can now calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
   * Lylah's salary now = $43,077 * 1.40 = $60,300 (approximately)

5. **Total Salary:**  Finally, we can calculate the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later.
   * Total salary = Adrien's salary now + Lylah's salary now
   * Total salary = $56,000 + $60,300 = $116,300

"Let's break down the problem:

* Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
* She slept 2 hours less each day for the next two days, totaling 6 hours per day.
* For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days.

To find the total sleep for the week, we need to calculate the total sleep for the first three days and then add the sleep for the rest of the week.

**Total sleep for the first three days:** 8 hours (Monday) + 6 hours (Tuesday) + 6 hours (Wednesday) = 20 hours

**Total sleep for the rest of the week:** 20 hours + 13 hours = 33 hours

**Answer:** 33 hours

"To solve this, we need to consider Rosie's speed and time in two separate segments. 

* **Segment 1:**  Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours, covering a distance of 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.
* **Segment 2:**  She then runs at 5 miles per hour for 4 hours, covering a distance of 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.

To find the total distance, we add the distances from both segments: 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of spoons in the original package Julia bought.
* We know she had 12 spoons after using 3, so:  x - 3 = 12
* Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so: x + 5 = 17
* Now we have two equations:
    * x - 3 = 12
    * x + 5 = 17
* Solve for 'x' in the first equation: x = 12 + 3 = 15
* Therefore, the original package had **15** spoons.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

* Let 'w' represent the cost of a watermelon.
* Since a watermelon costs three times the price of a pepper, we know the cost of a pepper is 'w/3'.
* An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it costs 'w - $5'.

Now, let's translate the given information into equations:

*  Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so the cost is 4w.
*  He buys 20 peppers, so the cost is 20 * (w/3).
*  He buys 10 oranges, so the cost is 10 * (w - $5).

Finally, we can express the total cost as:

Total cost = 4w + 20 * (w/3) + 10 * (w - $5)

Simplifying the equation:

Total cost = 4w + (20/3)w + 10w - 50

* **Define Variables:**
   * Let 'q' represent the number of queens.
   * Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

* **Formulate Equations:**
   * We know the total number of bees is 700:  q + b + w = 700
   * We are given that worker bees are twice the number of baby bees: w = 2b

"Let's break down this problem using our knowledge of units and rates.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find the time it takes for the loser to finish the race, which means we need to find the time it takes for Tim to complete the distance.

**Key Conversions:**

* **Miles to Feet:**  We need to convert miles to feet since the speed is given in feet per minute. 
* **Speed:** We'll use the given speeds to calculate the time.

**Calculations:**

1. **Steve's Distance:**
   * Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is equal to 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet.

2. **Steve's Time:**
   * Steve's speed is 440 feet per minute.
   * Time = Distance / Speed
   * Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

3. **Tim's Distance:**
   * Tim's distance is 2 miles, which is equal to 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet.

4. **Tim's Time:**
   * Tim's speed is 264 feet per minute.
   * Time = Distance / Speed
   * Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   * The winner is the one who finishes the race first. 
   * Tim finishes the race in 40 minutes.
   * Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes.
   * The loser is Steve.

**Answer:** The winner will be waiting at their house for **4** minutes.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** Dave had a large pack of french fries.

2. **Seagull's snack:** The seagull ate half of Dave's fries, leaving 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

3. **Pigeons' interference:** Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, totaling 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

4. **Remaining fries:** After the seagull and pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries left.

5. **Raccoon's raid:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33.  Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round down to 5.

6. **Final count:** The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Therefore, there were 7 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 'S' represent Seth's current age.
*  Let 'B' represent Brooke's current age.

We are given the following information:

*  S = 2B (Seth is twice as old as Brooke)
*  S + B + 2 = 28 (The sum of their ages in 2 years)

**Solving for S:**

1. **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**
   (2B) + B + 2 = 28

2. **Simplify:**
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Isolate the 'B' term:**
   3B = 26

4. **Solve for 'B':**
   B = 26 / 3 
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

**Finding S:**

*  Since S = 2B, we can substitute the value of B we just found:
   S = 2 * 8.67
   S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the ages of the birds.

* Let 'S' represent Sally's age.
* Let 'G' represent Granny Red's age.
* Let 'S2' represent Sally Two's age.
* Let 'S4' represent Sally Four's age.

We are given the following information:

* S2 = S + 3 
* G = 2 * S4
* S4 = S32
* S32 = 8

Now, we can use these equations to solve for the ages of the birds.

Since S4 = S32, we know S4 = 8.  Substituting this into the equation G = 2 * S4, we get G = 2 * 8 = 16.

Substituting S4 = 8 into the equation S2 = S + 3, we get S2 = 8 + 3 = 11.

Finally, we can find the total age of the birds by adding their ages: S + G + S2 + S4 = 8 + 16 + 11 + 8 = 43.

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 43.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of gallons of lemonade they made.
* The total revenue from selling the lemonade is 20 * $0.50 * x = 10x dollars.
* The total cost of lemons is 3 * x dollars.
* The total cost of sugar is 2 * x dollars.
* The total cost of making the lemonade is 3x + 2x = 5x dollars.
* We know the profit is $25, so the total revenue minus the total cost equals the profit: 10x - 5x = 25.
* Simplifying the equation, 5x = 25.
* Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 5 gallons.
* The cost of lemons is 3 * 5 = $15.

"Let's break down Zaid's expenses and calculate his remaining money.

* **Rent:**  Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 6000$ * (1/4) = 1500$.
* **Car Fuel:** He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 6000$ * (1/3) = 2000$.
* **Total Expenses:**  His total expenses are 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$.
* **Money Remaining:**  After covering his expenses, Zaid has 6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$.
* **Charity Donation:** He donates half of his remaining money to charity, which is 2500$ / 2 = 1250$.
* **Money After Charity:**  After the donation, he has 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$.
* **Total Given to Daughter and Wife:**  He gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$, totaling 200$ + 700$ = 900$.
* **Final Remaining Money:**  He has 1250$ - 900$ = 350$ left.

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the number of crabs each person has.

* Let 'B' represent the number of crabs Bo has.
* Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 'B - 4' crabs.
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 'B - 4 + 10' crabs.

Now we can express the total number of crabs as:

Total crabs = B + (B - 4) + (B - 4 + 10)

Simplifying the equation:

Total crabs = 3B + 2

We know that Bo has 40 crabs, so B = 40.  Substituting this into the equation:

Total crabs = 3(40) + 2
Total crabs = 120 + 2
Total crabs = 122

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of white carnations.** 
* **Sandra ordered 4 times the number of white carnations, so she ordered 4x red roses.**
* **We also know that Fred ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are 5 times the number of white carnations, so Fred ordered 5x white carnations.**

**To find the number of red roses, we can use the following equation:**

Red roses = 4x

**We also know that Sandra ordered 160 red roses, so we can set up the equation:**

4x = 160

**Solving for x:**

x = 160 / 4

x = 40

**Therefore, Fred must deliver 40 red roses by 5 pm.**

"Let's break down the problem using variables:

* Let Jan's current age be represented by the variable 'j'.
* Let Mark's current age be represented by the variable 'm'.

We are given the following information:

*  j = 30 (Jan's current age)
*  m = 22 (Mark's current age)
*  m - 2 = 5 + (j / 2) (Mark's age two years ago)

Now, we can solve for 'm' in the second equation:

* m - 2 = 5 + (30 / 2)
* m - 2 = 5 + 15
* m - 2 = 20
* m = 22

Finally, we can find Jean's age:

* Jean's age = m + 2
* Jean's age = 22 + 2
* Jean's age = 24

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Team 1:** Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
* **Team 2:**  The first runner is 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

To find the time for Team 2, we need to calculate the time for each runner:

* **Runner 1:** 60 seconds
* **Runner 2:** 60 seconds + 3 seconds = 63 seconds
* **Runner 3:** 63 seconds + 3 seconds = 66 seconds
* **Runner 4:** 66 seconds + 3 seconds = 69 seconds

Now, let's calculate the total time for Team 2: 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds

Finally, we can find the difference in time between the two teams: 258 seconds (Team 2) - 220 seconds (Team 1) = 38 seconds.


**Answer:** Team 1 will win by 38 seconds.

"Let's break down this probability problem. 

We want to find the relative likelihood of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, compared to the likelihood of rolling two even numbers in a row. 

* **Favorable Outcomes:**  There are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die.
* **Total Possible Outcomes:** There are 6 possible outcomes on a die.
* **Probability of a number greater than 3:**  3/6 = 1/2 = 50%
* **Probability of two even numbers in a row:**  There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6). The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 25%.

**Calculating the Difference:**

The difference in probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

**Answer:** The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 50%, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 25%.  Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Hamsters:** We know 10 cages of hamsters are distributed with 5 pieces of straw each, totaling 10 * 5 = 50 pieces.
* **Rats:** We know 160 pieces of straw were used in total, and 50 pieces were used with hamsters, leaving 160 - 50 = 110 pieces for the rats.
* **Rat Distribution:**  We need to figure out how many rats are in each cage.  
* **Rat Calculation:**  We can find the number of rats by dividing the total straw used for rats (110) by the number of pieces per rat (6): 110 / 6 = 18.33.
* **Rat Cage Size:**  Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number.  

**Answer:** There are **6** rats in each cage.

"Let's break down the problem using algebraic equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of bags the trader sold.
* The trader bought the bags at a cost of $20 each, so the total cost is 20x.
* The trader transported each bag for $2, so the total transportation cost is 2x.
* The trader sold each bag for $30, so the total revenue is 30x.
* The profit is the difference between the revenue and the total cost and transportation expenses.  

We know the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation:

30x - (20x + 2x) = 400

Simplifying the equation:

10x = 400

Solving for x:

x = 400 / 10

x = 40

Therefore, the trader sold **40** bags.

**Therefore, Mark earns 3000x cents per week.**

"John's award provides a one-time monetary reward of $5000.  To calculate his total earnings for the year, we need to consider his salary increase.  

His salary increases by 5% of his current salary, which is $2000.  

* **Calculate the raise:** $2000 * 0.05 = $100
* **Calculate his new salary:** $2000 + $100 = $2100
* **Calculate his total earnings for the year:** $2100 * 52 weeks = $109,200

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Sandwiches:** Carl ate 7 sandwiches this week.
* **Slices per sandwich:** Each sandwich has 2 slices of cheese.
* **Total slices from sandwiches:** 7 sandwiches * 2 slices/sandwich = 14 slices.

* **Omelets:** He ate 3 omelets.
* **Slices per omelet:** Each omelet has 1 more slice than a sandwich, so 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices/omelet.
* **Total slices from omelets:** 3 omelets * 3 slices/omelet = 9 slices.

* **Macaroni and Cheese:** He used 8 slices of cheese for this dish.

* **Total slices used:** 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices = 31 slices.


**Answer:** 31 slices

"To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we need to consider the total points needed and the points already earned. 

Here's how to solve it:

* **Total points needed:** 93 * 6 = 558
* **Total points from the first five tests:** 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448
* **Points needed on the sixth test:** 558 - 448 = 110

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of **110** on the sixth test.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Monday:** Rose buys 4 cakes.
* **Tuesday:** She buys 3 times the number from Monday, so 3 * 4 = 12 cakes.
* **Wednesday:** She buys 5 times the number from Tuesday, so 5 * 12 = 60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes, we add the number from each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

**Answer:** 76

"Let's break down this problem using algebra. 

* Let 'x' represent the cost of one cup.
* The cost of twenty dozen cups is 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
* The cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.
* We know the cost of twenty dozen cups is $34800 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.  

Now we can set up an equation:

240x = 36000 - 1200

Solving for x:

240x = 34800
x = 34800 / 240
x = $145

**Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.**

"Let's break down the problem to find the solution.

* **Let 'm' represent the number of lawn mowing sessions Sara needs to do.**

* **Earnings from lawn mowing:**  She earns $4 per lawn mowing session.  Therefore, her total earnings from mowing are 4m.

* **Earnings from babysitting:** She earns $5 per babysitting session. She babysits 4 times, so her earnings from babysitting are 4 * $5 = $20.

* **Total earnings:** Her total earnings from both activities are 4m + $20.

* **Total cost:** The jacket and shoes cost $30 + (2 * $20) = $70.

* **Setting up the equation:** We want to find the value of 'm' when her total earnings equal the total cost.  This means: 4m + $20 = $70

* **Solving for 'm':**
    * Subtract $20 from both sides: 4m = $50

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.**
* **Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.**

We know the following:

* **Total chickens:** r + w = total chickens
* **Egg production:** 3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs collected)
* **White chickens are two more than red:** r = w + 2

**Solving for 'r'**

1. **Substitute:** Since we know r = w + 2, we can substitute that into the first equation: 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42

2. **Simplify and solve:**
   3w + 6 + 5w = 42
   8w + 6 = 42
   8w = 36
   w = 4.5

3. **Find 'r':**  We know r = w + 2.  Since we can't have half a chicken, there's likely an error in the problem statement. 


**Answer:** The problem as stated is not solvable.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to consider the perimeter of the rectangle.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Therefore:

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 15 miles and the speed is 3 miles per hour.  Therefore:

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

"To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to consider the total customers from the first two days.  

* **Day 1:** Sloane counted 100 customers.
* **Day 2:** She counted 50 more than day 1, so she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
* **Total for the first two days:** 100 + 150 = 250 customers.
* **Day 3:**  The total number of customers over the three days is 500.  Therefore, Sloane counted 500 - 250 = 250 customers on the third day.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using algebra.

**Understanding the Problem**

We're given information about the rate of water loss from two pools and the current water levels.  We need to find the amount of water in the small pool.

**Setting up the Equations**

* Let 'x' represent the initial amount of water in the small pool.
* The big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, so it had 2x gallons.

**Analyzing the Changes**

* Both pools lose 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, resulting in a total loss of 16 gallons.

**Formulating the Relationship**

* The problem states that the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool. This translates to the following equation: 8x = 4(x - 16)

**Solving for x**

* Simplify the equation: 8x = 4x - 64
* Solve for x: 4x = -64
* Divide both sides by 4: x = -16

**Addressing the Issue**

* We arrive at a negative value for 'x'. This indicates an inconsistency in the problem's setup.  It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way. 


**Conclusion**

The problem as stated is not solvable.

"Let's break down the problem. Janeth borrowed $2000 and is required to repay it with an additional 10% of the principal amount.  This means she'll pay an extra $200 on top of the original loan. 

We need to consider the total amount she'll pay over the 12-month period.  She'll pay $165 per month for 12 months, totaling $1980. 

To find the remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she'll pay.  

The total amount she'll pay is $1980.  

The remaining balance is $2000 + $200 - $1980 = $2080.

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the ages.

* Let Adrian's age be represented by 'a'
* Let Harriet's age be represented by 'h'
* Let Zack's age be represented by 'z'

We are given the following equations:

*  a = 3h  (Adrian's age is three times Harriet's)
*  h = z/2  (Harriet's age is half of Zack's)

We are asked to find the average age of the three in three years.  This means we need to find the average of (a + h + z + 3) in three years.

First, let's find the ages in three years:

* a + 3 = 3h + 3 = 3(z/2) + 3 = (3z/2) + 3
* h + 3 = h + 3 = (z/2) + 3

Now, we can find the average age in three years:

( (3z/2) + 3 + (z/2) + 3 + z + 3) / 3

Simplifying the expression:

( (3z/2) + (z/2) + z + 9) / 3

Combining like terms:

( (4z/2) + 9) / 3

(2z + 9) / 3

We can substitute the value of z from the first equation (h = z/2) to get the final answer.

(2 * (z/2) + 9) / 3

(z + 9) / 3

Since we know that h = z/2, we can substitute that into the equation to get the final answer.

(z + 9) / 3

**Final answer: (z + 9) / 3**

"Let's break down the problem to find Jojo's score.

* **Naomi's points:** We know Naomi scored 68 points.
* **Yuri's points:** Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, which is 34. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.
* **Brianna's points:** Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
* **Total points:** The total score for all four students is 251.  
* **Jojo's points:**  To find Jojo's score, we can subtract the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total score: 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 104.

**Therefore, Jojo scored 104 points.**

"To determine the time it takes to complete the puzzle, we need to consider the rate at which each person adds pieces. Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, while her mom adds half that amount, meaning she adds 2 pieces per minute.  

The combined rate of the two is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.  

To find the total time, we divide the total number of pieces (360) by the combined rate (6 pieces per minute):

360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Finally, we convert this to hours: 60 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1 hour.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Step 1: Initial Harvest**
   - The farm started with 120 watermelons.

* **Step 2: Remaining Watermelons**
   - After the first harvest, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left.

* **Step 3: Second Harvest**
   -  Three-fourths of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest, which is (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons.

* **Step 4: Watermelons Not Ready**
   -  To find the number of watermelons not ready, we subtract the number harvested from the total: 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.

"Let's calculate the total cost.  

First, we need to find the cost of the cars after the 10% tax is applied.  The cost of the cars is $240,000.  

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars after the 10% tax is applied.  The tax is 10% of the cost of the cars, which is $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.  

The total cost of the cars after the tax is $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.

Finally, we need to add the cost of registration, which is $1000 per car multiplied by the number of cars, which is 12 cars.  This gives us $1000 * 12 = $12,000.

Therefore, the total cost of the fleet of cars is $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Ferdinand's trees:**  Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has, so he has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.
* **Twice Ferdinand's trees:**  Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is 3 * 2 = 6 trees.
* **Harry's trees:** Harry has 5 more than twice Ferdinand's trees, so he has 6 + 5 = 11 trees.
* **Difference:** Harry has 11 - 3 = 8 more trees than Ferdinand.


**Answer:** Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Carmen's money:**  Let's represent Carmen's money with the variable 'C'.
* **Samantha's money:** Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so her money is C + 25.
* **Daisy's money:** Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so her money is C + 25 + 50.

Now, to find the total amount of money, we need to add up the amounts for each girl:

C + (C + 25) + (C + 25 + 50)

Simplifying the equation:

3C + 100 = Total money

To find the total, we need to find the value of C.  We can do this by using the fact that Carmen has $100. 

Therefore, C = 100.

Now, substitute the value of C back into the equation:

3 * 100 + 100 = Total money

300 + 100 = Total money

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Selling Price:** Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.
* **Transfer Fees:**  He paid 3% of the selling price for transfer fees, which is 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000.
* **Brokerage Fees:** He paid 5% of the selling price for brokerage fees, which is 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000.
* **Total Fees:**  The total fees he paid are $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.
* **Net Proceeds:**  To find his net proceeds, we subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $100,000.

**Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $100,000.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Cards with A:**  Carly had 80 cards, and 2/5 of them had the letter A.  This means 2/5 * 80 = 32 cards had the letter A.
* **Cards remaining after A:**  After removing the cards with A, she had 80 - 32 = 48 cards left.
* **Cards with B:**  1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, so 48 / 2 = 24 cards had the letter B.
* **Cards remaining after B:**  After removing the cards with B, there were 48 - 24 = 24 cards left.
* **Cards with C:**  5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, so 24 * (5/8) = 15 cards had the letter C.
* **Cards with D:**  The final step is to find the number of cards with the letter D.  The total number of cards with A, B, and C is 32 + 24 + 15 = 71.  Therefore, the number of cards with D is 80 - 71 = 9.

*  R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
*  R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now, we can express the first equation in terms of 'S':

* R = 6S

Substitute this value of 'R' into the second equation:

* 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Simplify and solve for 'S':

* 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
* 3S = 18
* S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

* **We know a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, so a cobra has 2x spots.**
* **We know there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.**
* **The total number of spots is the sum of spots on all the cobras and mambas.**

**To find the total number of spots, we can set up an equation:**

* 40 * 70 + 60 * x = total spots

**We can solve for x:**

* 2800 + 60x = total spots
* 60x = total spots - 2800
* 60x = 2100 
* x = 2100 / 60

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of proportional relationships.  

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.
    * We know the car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour, and the car in the slow lane travels at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

* **Set up the equation:**
    * The distance traveled by the car in the fast lane is 60 miles per hour * x hours = 60x miles.
    * The distance traveled by the car in the slow lane is 30 miles per hour * x hours = 30x miles.
    * Since they both travel the same distance, we can set up the equation: 60x = 30x

* **Solve for x:**
    * 60x = 30x
    * 30x = 0
    * x = 0

* **Answer:** The car in the slow lane took **0 hours** to cover the same distance.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Ali has 22 medals and Izzy has 5 fewer, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.
* Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Mike's points:**  Let's represent Mike's points as 'm'.
* **Jim's points:** Jim has 3 less than Mike, so his points are 'm - 3'.
* **Tony's points:** Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so his points are '2m'.

**Round 4:**  Each player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.  

* **Mike:**  m + 1
* **Jim:**  m - 3 + 1 = m - 2
* **Tony:** 2m + 1

**Total points:**  To find the total points after round 4, we need to add the points of all three players.

**Solution:** 
 
  * Mike: m + 1
  * Jim: m - 2
  * Tony: 2m + 1

  * Total points: (m + 1) + (m - 2) + (2m + 1) = 4m - 0 = 4m

  *  We need to find the value of 'm' to get the total points.

"Let's break down Darren's exercise routine:

* **Day 1:** 100 pushups, 50 squats, 20 dumbbell presses.
* **Day 2:**  An increase of 20 pushups, a decrease of 10 squats, and doubling the dumbbell presses.

To find the total number of activities, we need to calculate the total for each exercise on each day and then add them together.

**Day 1:**

* Jane's age is 'q - 3' years old.
* Trent's age is 'q - 3 + 5' years old.

We know that Quinn is 30 years old, so q = 30.

Now we can substitute this value into our expressions for Jane and Trent's ages:

* Jane's age: q - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
* Trent's age: q - 3 + 5 = 30 - 3 + 5 = 32

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

"Let's break down the problem using variables. 

* Let 'x' represent Noah's current age.
* Cera's current age is 46.

We know that six years ago:

* Noah was x - 6 years old.
* Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

We are also given that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age. This translates to the equation: 
  Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 * (x - 6)

We also know that the population of Chile six years ago was 60,000.  Therefore:
  60,000 = 3000 * (x - 6)

Now we can solve for x:

1. Divide both sides by 3000: 60,000 / 3000 = x - 6
2. Simplify: 20 = x - 6
3. Add 6 to both sides: 20 + 6 = x
4. Solve for x: x = 26

Therefore, Noah's current age is 26.

To find the current population of Chile, we can use the fact that Cera is currently 46 years old.  Since Cera is 46 years old, and the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, we can find the current population of Chile by substituting the value of x into the equation:

Current population of Chile = 3000 * (26 - 6)
Current population of Chile = 3000 * 20
Current population of Chile = 60,000

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.  Since the offense has twice as many players as the defense, we know there are 2x players on offense.  

The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

The total number of players is 105, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

To solve for x, we can combine like terms:

(7/2)x = 105

Now, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (7/2), which is (2/7):

x = 105 * (2/7)

Simplify:

x = 30

**Therefore, there are 30 players on the defense.**

"The pool's volume is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth: 6 feet * 4 feet * 5 feet = 120 cubic feet.  The cost to fill the pool is then determined by multiplying the volume by the price per cubic foot, which is $0.10.  Therefore, the total cost is 120 cubic feet * $0.10/cubic foot = $12.00. 


**Answer:** $12.00

"Let's break down the problem using variables:

* Let 'b' represent the number of boys in the classroom.
* Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is 3b.
* The number of non-gendered children is 1/10 the number of boys, so it's (1/10)b.

Now we can express the total number of children as: b + 3b + (1/10)b = Total children

Simplifying the equation: 4b + (1/10)b = Total children

Combining like terms: (41/10)b = Total children

To find the total number of children, we need to know the value of 'b'. We know there are 30 boys, so:

b = 30

Substituting 'b' back into the equation: (41/10) * 30 = Total children

Calculating the result: 123 

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is **123**.

"
"Let's break down the problem:

We know that 5 people traded their records.  They received a total of 7 new records.  This means the number of old records they brought in is related to the number of new records they received.  

We can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of old records each person brought in.**
* **The number of new records they received is equal to the number of old records they brought in divided by 2.**

Therefore, we can write the equation: 5x = 7

To solve for 'x', we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

* x = 7 / 5 = 1.4

This answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.  We can't have half a record!

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

1.  **Total animals:** c + w = 60 
2.  **Chickens vs. Cows:** c = 2w

Now, we can solve for our variables.  

**Solving for 'c'**

From the second equation, we can isolate 'c':
c = 2w

**Substituting into the first equation**

Substitute this value of 'c' into the first equation:
(2w) + w = 60

**Simplifying and Solving for 'w'**

Combine like terms: 3w = 60
Divide both sides by 3: w = 20

**Solving for 'c'**

Now that we know 'w' (the number of cows), we can find 'c' using the equation c = 2w:
c = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculating Total Legs**

* Chickens have 2 legs each: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

"April needs 30 plant pots for daisies and twice that amount for roses, so she needs a total of 30 * 2 = 60 rose pots.  She already has 100 pots, and needs 90 in total.  Therefore, she has 100 - 90 = 10 pots left over. 

**Answer:** 10

"To find out how much Andrea saved, we need to consider the initial amount she had and the subsequent transactions.  

* **Initial Savings:** Andrea began with $36.
* **Spending:** She spent $11 on a sweater.
* **Giving to Brother:** She gave $4 to her brother.

To find her savings, we need to subtract the cost of the sweater and the amount given to her brother from her initial amount.

**Calculation:** $36 - $11 - $4 = $21

**Answer:** Andrea saved $21.

"Let's break down John's vacation activities:

* **Boating:** 6 hours
* **Swimming:** 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours
* **Shows:** 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours
* **Total time:** 6 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours
* **Time spent on shows as a percentage:** 6 hours / 15 hours * 100% = 40%
* **Time spent sightseeing:** 15 hours * 40% = 6 hours

**Answer:** 6 hours

"To find out how much money Annabelle still needs to save, we need to calculate her total earnings and then subtract that from the cost of the phone. 

* **Earnings from her first job:** $10/hour * 20 hours = $200
* **Earnings from her second job:** $5/hour * 15 hours = $75
* **Total earnings:** $200 + $75 = $275
* **Money still needed:** $400 - $275 = $125

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save **$125**.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the height of the shortest tree.**
* **The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest, so it's x + 5 feet tall.**
* **The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shorter trees, meaning it's 2(x + (x + 5)) feet tall.**

Now, let's simplify and solve for 'x':

* **2(x + (x + 5)) = 2(2x + 5)**
* **2(2x + 5) = 4x + 10**
* **4x + 10 = 34**
* **4x = 24**
* **x = 6**

**Therefore, the shortest tree is 6 feet tall.**

**The second tree is 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet tall.**

**The tallest tree is 2(6 + 11) = 2 * 17 = 34 feet tall.**


**Answer:** 34

"Let's break down the problem to find the solution.

* **Mini-golf:**  The cost per person is $5.  
* **Go-karts:** Each ride costs $10.
* **Total Budget:**  Morgan has $90 to spend.

To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to consider the cost of the activities and the total budget.

**Let's represent the number of friends as ""x"".**

* **Mini-golf:** 5 * x 
* **Go-karts:** 10 * 2 = $20 (since she wants to ride twice)
* **Total Cost:** 5x + 20

**We know the total cost must be less than or equal to the budget:**

5x + 20 ≤ 90

**Now, solve for x:**

1. Subtract 20 from both sides: 5x ≤ 70
2. Divide both sides by 5: x ≤ 14

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

Billy has $10.00 and wants to buy candy. We need to figure out how much candy he bought and how many pounds of candy he bought.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.
* The cost of the candy is 1.50 dollars per pound.
* The cost of gumballs is 0.05 dollars per gumball.

**Solving for the Number of Pounds of Candy:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the candy:** 1.50x dollars
2. **Calculate the amount of money Billy had left after buying gumballs:** 10.00 - 0.20 = 9.80 dollars
3. **Solve for x:** 9.80 / 1.50 = x

**Finding the Answer:**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

The train makes a series of trips between three cities.  We need to determine the number of days it takes for the train to complete a full service cycle.

**Key Information:**

* **Distance between cities:**
    * City 1 to City 2: 75 miles
    * City 2 to City 3: 100 miles
    * City 3 to City 1: 50 miles less than the combined distance between City 2 and City 3, so it's 100 - 50 = 50 miles.
* **Total distance per trip:** 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles
* **Service interval:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:** The train travels 225 miles per trip * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.

2. **Calculate the number of days between services:** The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles.  The number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

3. **Round to the nearest whole number:** The train needs service every 26.67 days, which rounds to **27 days**.

"Let's break down the trip into its components:

* **Distance to friend's house:** 200 miles
* **Speed to friend's house:** 70 mph
* **Detour distance:** 10 miles
* **Speed on the return trip:** 80 mph
* **Distance to return home:** 240 miles

**Step 1: Time to reach the friend's house**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours (approximately)

**Step 2: Time for the detour**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours (approximately)

**Step 3: Time to return home**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

**Step 4: Total time**

* Total time = Time to reach friend's house + Time for detour + Time to return home
* Total time = 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours

**Therefore, the total time for the trip is 6.00 hours.**

"Let's break down the problem using variables. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of people kicked out for reasons other than mask refusal, shoplifting, or physical violence.

We know the following:

* **Mask Refusal:** 3 customers were kicked out for mask refusal, which can be represented as 3 * 4 = 12 people.
* **Shoplifting:** 12 people were kicked out for shoplifting, and this can be represented as 12 - 5 = 7 people.
* **Physical Violence:** 3 * 7 = 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.

We also know that the total number of people kicked out is 50.  

Therefore, we can set up an equation: 

x + 12 + 7 + 21 = 50

Simplifying the equation:

x + 40 = 50

Solving for x:

x = 50 - 40

x = 10

"Let's solve this problem using algebra.  

Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.  We know that he sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  This can be represented by the equation:

(3/5)x = 12.8

To find the original amount of land, we need to isolate 'x'.  Here's how:

1. **Multiply both sides by 5/3:** 
   (5/3) * (3/5)x = 12.8 * (5/3)

2. **Simplify:** x = 21.33 hectares (approximately)

**Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had approximately 21.33 hectares of land.**

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios and proportions.

**Understanding the Ratio:**

The ratio 5:6 represents the relationship between the number of popsicles Betty and Sam have.  This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

**Setting up the Equation:**

We know the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.  We can represent this as:

5x + 6x = 165

**Solving for x:**

* Combine like terms: 11x = 165
* Divide both sides by 11: x = 15

**Finding the Number of Popsicles for Each Person:**

* Betty has 5x popsicles, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.
* Sam has 6x popsicles, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

**Determining the Difference:**

* Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.


**Answer:** Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Writing:** Carol spends 4 hours on the song.
* **Recording:** She spends half that time recording, so 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours.
* **Editing:** She spends 90 minutes editing.

**To find the percentage of time spent editing, we need to convert the editing time to hours:**

* 90 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1.5 hours

**Now, we can calculate the percentage:**

* (1.5 hours / 6 hours) * 100% = 25%

**Therefore, Carol spent 25% of her total work time editing.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We need to find the total number of books Wendy needs.
* She wants to add 20 more than double the number of books in a single row.
*  Let 'x' represent the number of books in a single row. 
*  The total number of books in the system is then 6 * x.
*  We know that 6 * x + 20 represents the total number of books Wendy needs.

Therefore, the equation is: 6x + 20 = 32

Solving for x:

* Subtract 20 from both sides: 6x = 12
* Divide both sides by 6: x = 2

Now, we can find the total number of books:

* 6 * 2 = 12
* 12 + 20 = 32

**Answer:** Wendy needs 32 books.

"Here's how to solve the problem:

1. **Find the total amount given away:**  Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza, and Mark gets 1/4.  To find the total, we add these fractions: 1/3 + 1/4.  To add fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 3 and 4 is 12. So, we convert the fractions: (4/12) + (3/12) = 7/12.

2. **Calculate the total slices given away:**  Since 7/12 of the pizza was given away, that means 7 slices were given to Bill and Mark.

3. **Calculate the number of slices remaining:**  We start with 12 slices and subtract the slices given away: 12 - 7 = 5 slices.

4. **Subtract the slices Jenny ate:** Jenny ate 2 slices, so we subtract that from the remaining slices: 5 - 2 = 3 slices.

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let Erica's age be represented by 'e'.  We know Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is 'e + 5'.  Alice is 7 years older than Beth, making her age 'e + 5 + 7'.

We are given that Erica is 30 years old, so 'e = 30'.  Substituting this into our expressions for Beth and Alice, we get:

* Beth = 30 + 5 = 35
* Alice = 30 + 5 + 7 = 42

Finally, the difference between Alice and Erica's ages is 42 - 30 = 12.

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of conditional probability. 

* **Event A:** A candle smells like wet dog.
* **Event B:** A candle explodes.

We are given that 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.  

We want to find the probability of a candle being both defective and exploding.  

**Understanding the Relationship**

The key here is that the defect and explosion are not independent events.  A candle that is defective is more likely to explode.  

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use the following formula:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

Where:

* P(A and B) is the probability of both events happening.
* P(A) is the probability of event A (a candle smelling like wet dog).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.

**Applying the Formula**

* P(A) = 0.05 (5% of the candles have a defect)
* P(B|A) = 1 (If a candle is defective, it is guaranteed to explode)

Therefore:

P(A and B) = 0.05 * 1 = 0.05

**Answer:** 0.05 or 5%

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step using variables to represent the unknown quantities.

* Let 'a' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
* Let 't' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.

We know the following:

* Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
* Joanne gathers half the number of apples from the shortest trees as she does from the tallest trees, so b = 30 / 2 = 15.
* Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than her sister, and we know her sister gathers 3 times as many from the shortest trees as Joanne. 
* Joanne's sister gathers 60 apples from the shortest trees.
* The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples.

We can now set up an equation to represent the total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister:

* a + b + t = 500

We also know that:

* a = 30 + 15 + x
* b = 15
* t = 30

Substituting these values into the equation:

* (30 + 15 + x) + 15 + 30 = 500

Simplifying the equation:

* 75 + x + 15 + 30 = 500
* 120 + x = 500
* x = 500 - 120
* x = 380

Therefore, Joanne gathered **380** apples from the average trees.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

* Let 'c' represent the number of camels.
* Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

To solve for 'd' (the number of dromedaries), we can use a method called substitution.  

1. **Solve Equation 1 for 'c':** 
   From Equation 1, we can isolate 'c':  c = 180 - d

2. **Substitute into Equation 2:**
   Substitute the value of 'c' from step 1 into Equation 2: 2(180 - d) + d = 304

3. **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
   Expand the equation: 360 - 2d + d = 304
   Combine like terms: 360 - d = 304
   Isolate 'd': -d = -56
   Solve for 'd': d = 56

**Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.**

"Let's break down this problem using algebra.

* Let 'x' represent the original price of the tattered jeans.
* The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost x - 6.
* The total cost of the jeans is the sum of the prices of both types: x + (x - 6) = 2x - 6.
* We know that Cole saved a total of $6.  This means: 
   *  The amount saved from the jogger jeans is (1/3) * (x - 6)
   *  The amount saved from the tattered jeans is (1/3) * (x)
* We can set up an equation to represent the total savings: (1/3) * (x - 6) + (1/3) * (x) = 6
* Simplifying the equation: (x - 6)/3 + (x)/3 = 6
* Combining like terms: (2x - 6)/3 = 6
* Multiplying both sides by 3: 2x - 6 = 18
* Adding 6 to both sides: 2x = 24
* Dividing both sides by 2: x = 12
* The original price of the tattered jeans is $12.
* The original price of the jogger jeans is x - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6.
* The difference in price is 12 - 6 = 6.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

* Let 'c' represent the number of candy bars George bought.
* Let 'x' represent the total amount of money George spent on candy bars.

We know the following:

*  The cost of chips is 0.40 per bag, and George bought 3 bags, so the cost of chips is 3 * 0.40 = 1.20
*  George had 1% of his money left, which is equal to 0.01 * 5 = 0.05.
*  The total amount George spent is 5 - 0.05 = 4.95.
*  The cost of each candy bar is 0.75.

We can set up an equation to represent the total cost:

x = 0.75c + 1.20

We can also express the total amount spent in terms of the number of candy bars:

x = 0.75c + 1.20

We can solve for 'c' by substituting the value of 'x' from the first equation into the second equation:

0.75c + 1.20 = 4.95

Solving for 'c':

0.75c = 3.75
c = 3.75 / 0.75
c = 5

"The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width.  We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet.  To find the width, we can use the formula:

Area = length * width

360 = 9 * width

Solving for the width, we get:

width = 360 / 9 = 40 feet

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides.  Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, we can use the following formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

* **Towels:** Each room has twice the number of towels as pillowcases, so 4 pillowcases * 2 = 8 towels.
* **Total Laundry:**  The total laundry per room is 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillowcases + 8 towels = 15 items.
* **Total Laundry for 80 Rooms:**  To find the total laundry for 80 rooms, we multiply the laundry per room by the number of rooms: 15 items/room * 80 rooms = 1200 items.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate pencils used:**  We know 1/5 of the total pencils were used.  This means 1/5 * 30 pencils = 6 pencils were used.

* **Step 2: Calculate pencils remaining after the first two months:**  We start with 30 pencils and use 6, leaving us with 30 - 6 = 24 pencils.

* **Step 3: Calculate pencils remaining after the end of the year:** We know 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. This means 1/3 * 24 pencils = 8 pencils were left.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.**

* **Cookies:**  The problem states that Matt gets half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This translates to the equation: 0.5x + 2 = 5

* **Solve for x:**  To find the value of 'x', we need to isolate it.  Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation gives us: 0.5x = 3.  Then, dividing both sides by 0.5, we get: x = 6.

**Therefore, Matt must eat 6 carrot sticks.**

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length occupied by the remoras, we need to express the remora length as a fraction of the shark's total length. 

First, convert the shark's length from feet to inches: 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.

Next, convert the remora length from inches to a fraction of the shark's length: 72 inches.

Now, we can calculate the percentage: (72 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 60%. 


**Answer:** 60%

"Let's break down this problem using a simple algebraic approach.

We know that 3/4 of the students have desktop computers.  This means that 1/4 of the students do not have them.  We are given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.  

Let 'x' represent the total number of students. We can set up an equation:

(3/4)x - 20 = (1/4)x

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction: 3x - 80 = x
2. Subtract x from both sides: 2x - 80 = 0
3. Add 80 to both sides: 2x = 80
4. Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Therefore, there are **40** students at that grade level.

"Let's break down the problem using set theory.

* **Define the sets:**
    *  Let A represent the set of kids allergic to dairy.
    *  Let B represent the set of kids allergic to peanuts.
    *  Let C represent the set of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

* **We know:**
    *  |A| = 9 (9 kids are allergic to dairy)
    *  |B| = 6 (6 kids are allergic to peanuts)
    *  |C| = 3 (3 kids are allergic to both)

* **We want to find:** |A ∪ B ∪ C| (the number of kids who are not allergic to anything)

* **Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**
    *  |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

* **Since we know the intersections:**
    *  |A ∩ B| = |C| = 3
    *  |A ∩ C| = |B| = 6
    *  |B ∩ C| = |A| = 9

* **Substituting:**
    *  |A ∪ B ∪ C| = 9 + 6 + 3 - 3 - 6 - 9 + 3 = 14

**Therefore, 14 kids are not allergic to anything.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* Ashley brings 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges.
* Brianne brings 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brings 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.
* Together they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.
* To make one pie, they need 3 oranges.
* Therefore, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.

"Let's break down this cost problem using a system of equations. 

* **Let 'x' represent the number of guests.**

* **Venue 1:** The cost is $200 (fixed fee) + $5x (food cost) 
* **Venue 2:** The cost is $25x (per guest)

To find the point where the costs are equal, we set the two equations equal to each other:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Now, solve for 'x':

1. Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x
2. Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

Therefore, **10 guests** are needed for the two venues to have the same cost.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.  Since David found half of Bodhi's insects, David found x/2 insects.  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

The total number of insects is the sum of what each person found: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms, we get: 5x/2 + 7 = 43

Now, let's solve for x:

* Subtract 7 from both sides: 5x/2 = 36
* Multiply both sides by 2: 5x = 72
* Divide both sides by 5: x = 14.4

To find Lily's insects, substitute the value of x back into the expression (x/2) + 7:

(14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2

Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.

"To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to combine the yarn used by Mariah and her grandma.  

* **Combined yarn:**  Since they used 1/4 + 1/2 of a skein, we need to find a common denominator to add the fractions. The least common denominator is 4.
* **Converting fractions:** 1/4 = 1/4 * (1/1) = 1/4
* **Combined fraction:** 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4
* **Total yards:**  The total yarn used is 3/4 * 364 yards/skein = 273 yards.

"Cherrie needs to buy a total of 16 gifts. 

**Answer:** 26 
"
"Let's break down the problem using algebraic variables. 

* Let 'r' represent the width of the rug.
* We know the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so r = c + 5, where 'c' is the width of the chair.
* We also know the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width, so the couch's length is 2(r) + 2.

Now, we know the chair is 3 feet wide, so c = 3.  Substitute this into the equation for the rug's width: r = 3 + 5 = 8.

Finally, substitute the value of 'r' back into the equation for the couch's length: 2(8) + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, the couch is **18 feet** long.

"The problem presents a classic optimization scenario.  We need to determine the most efficient way to utilize the available budget to maximize the number of popsicle sticks. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **Cost Analysis:**  We need to find the combination of wood types that minimizes the total cost while maximizing the number of sticks. 
* **Decision Variable:** The decision variable is the number of 2x4 pieces Frederick buys.
* **Objective Function:** The objective is to maximize the number of popsicle sticks (which is our output).
* **Constraints:** The budget constraint is given as $24.

**Solution:**

The most cost-effective approach is to purchase the 2x4 wood.  

**Optimal Solution:**

Frederick should purchase 6 pieces of 2x4 wood. This will allow him to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make. 

**Calculation:**

* 6 pieces * 200 sticks/piece = 1200 sticks

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.  Since Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia bought, Rose bought 4x onions and 4x potatoes. We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up an equation:

* 4x = 12 
* x = 3 

This means Sophia bought 3 onions.  We also know Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia bought in potatoes, so she bought 4 * 3 = 12 potatoes.

Therefore, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.  The total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 3 + 1 = 4.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Step 1:** Julie starts with $500.
* **Step 2:** She spends 20% of this, which is (20/100) * $500 = $100 on clothes.
* **Step 3:**  This leaves her with $500 - $100 = $400.
* **Step 4:**  She then spends 25% of the remaining $400, which is (25/100) * $400 = $100 on CDs.
* **Step 5:**  Finally, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

"Here's how to solve this problem using proportional reasoning:

**Understanding the Relationship:**

The key is to recognize that the rate of work is directly proportional to the number of people.  If one person paints half a house in 5 days, we can find the time it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house.

**Setting up the Proportion:**

Let 'x' represent the number of days it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house.  We can set up a proportion:

(1 person's work) / (5 days) = (1 whole house) / (x days)

**Solving for x:**

*  Cross-multiply: 1 person * x = 5 days * 1 whole house
* Simplify: x = 5 days * 1 whole house / 1 person
*  Therefore, x = 5 days

**Answer:** It will take **5 days** for 5 people to paint a whole house.

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let 'O' represent the number of Ophelia's sofas and 'J' represent the number of Jenna's sofas.  We know:

*  O = J - 2  (Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than Jenna)
*  J = 3O (Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia)

We also know that Ophelia has 20 sofas, so:

* O = 20

Now we can substitute the value of O into the second equation:

* J = 3 * 20 
* J = 60

Finally, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs:

* Total sofas = O + J = 20 + 60 = 80
* Total chairs = J + O = 60 + 20 = 80

Therefore, Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 80 sofas and chairs. 


**Answer:** 80

"Let's break down the problem using algebra.  

Let 'x' represent the number of CDs Tom could have bought if he hadn't purchased the headphones.  We know the following:

* The cost of the headphones is $44.
* The total cost of the CDs and headphones is $48.

We can set up an equation: 

*  The cost of the CDs is $4x.
*  The total cost is $4x + $44.

The equation is: 4x + 44 = 48

Now, solve for x:

1. Subtract 44 from both sides: 4x = 4
2. Divide both sides by 4: x = 1

Therefore, Tom could have bought **1** more CD if he hadn't bought the headphones.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total workout time:**  We know Josh works out for 4 hours per week on average.
* **Consecutive weeks:** He spent 10 hours in two consecutive weeks.
* **Other weeks:** We need to find the total time spent on weeks where he didn't work out for 5 hours. 

To find the total hours, we can use the following:

* **Total hours = (Average weekly hours) * (Number of weeks) + (Consecutive weeks hours) + (Other weeks hours)**

Let's plug in the values:

* Total hours = (4 hours/week) * 8 weeks + 10 hours + (4 hours/week * 4 weeks)
* Total hours = 32 hours + 10 hours + 16 hours
* Total hours = 58 hours

"Let's break down the problem using algebra.

* Let Jame's current age be represented by the variable 'j'.
* In 8 years, Jame will be j + 8 years old.
* His cousin will be 2 times Jame's age in 8 years minus 5 years.  This can be represented as 2(j + 8) - 5.

We know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  This translates to the equation: 2(j + 8) - 5 = j + 5

Now, we can solve for 'j':

1. Expand the equation: 2j + 16 - 5 = j + 5
2. Combine like terms: 2j + 11 = j + 5
3. Subtract 'j' from both sides: j + 11 = 5
4. Subtract 11 from both sides: j = -6

This result doesn't make sense in the context of age.  It seems there's an error in the problem statement.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the computer.
* The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so it cost x - $400.
* The total cost of the computer, printer, and monitors is $2400.  This can be written as an equation: x + (x - $400) + 2(cost of a monitor) = $2400

* We know the computer costs $1100, so we can substitute that into the equation: 1100 + (1100 - $400) + 2(cost of a monitor) = $2400

* Simplifying the equation: 1100 + 700 + 2(cost of a monitor) = $2400
* Combining like terms: 1800 + 2(cost of a monitor) = $2400
* Subtracting 1800 from both sides: 2(cost of a monitor) = $600
* Dividing both sides by 2: cost of a monitor = $300

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Total shells brought by the boys:** The boys brought 60 shells each, and there were 2 groups, so they brought a total of 60 * 2 = 120 shells.
* **Girls' contribution:** The girls brought an amount equal to the boys' shells plus four times the number of shells the boys brought. This means they brought 120 + (4 * 60) = 120 + 240 = 360 shells.
* **Shells per girl:** To find out how many shells each girl brought, we divide the total shells brought by the girls by the number of girls: 360 shells / 10 girls = 36 shells/girl.

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let 'x' represent the number of candies Nick had initially.  

We know George had twice as many candies as Nick, so George had 2x candies.

George ate 5 candies, leaving him with 3.  This means: 2x - 5 = 3

Now we can solve for x:

1. Add 5 to both sides: 2x = 8
2. Divide both sides by 2: x = 4

Therefore, Nick had 4 candies initially. 


**Answer:** Nick has 4 candies.

"Let's break down the problem. Elvis's monthly savings goal is $1125.  To reach this goal, he needs to save a specific amount each day in the second half of the month.  

Let's represent the daily savings in the second half of the month as 'x'.  We know that he needs to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half.  

We can set up an equation:

*  x * 15 = 1125

To find the value of x, we can solve for it:

* x = 1125 / 15
* x = 75

Therefore, Elvis needs to save **$75** per day in the second half of the month.

*  Jeff receives 4 times Brad's amount, so Jeff receives 4x.
*  The total amount they receive is $100.  Therefore, x + 4x = 100.
*  Combining like terms, we get 5x = 100.
*  Solving for x, we divide both sides by 5 to find that x = 20.
*  Since Jeff receives 4 times Brad's amount, he receives 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.

"Let's break down Antonella's earnings. 

First, we need to determine the commission on the goods sold under $1000.  Since the commission rate is 30% on sales up to $1000, we multiply the amount sold by the commission rate: $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

Next, we need to calculate the commission on the sales exceeding $1000. The commission rate for sales over $1000 is 10%.  We find the difference between the total sales and the amount under $1000, which is $2500 - $1000 = $1500. Then, we multiply this amount by the commission rate: $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

Finally, to find Antonella's total earnings, we add the commissions from both categories: $300 + $150 = $450.


Therefore, Antonella earned $450.

* **Warm Water:** He swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time he takes in cold water, which is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.  So, in warm water, he swims for 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

* **Difference in Time:** To find the difference in time for swimming 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, we need to consider the time for each distance. 

* **3 Miles on a Hot Day:** Ray swims 3 miles in 34 minutes.
* **3 Miles on a Cold Day:** Ray swims 3 miles in 16 minutes.

* **Calculation:** The difference in time is 34 minutes - 16 minutes = 18 minutes.

"Let's break this down.  We know Juan drinks 10 times Octavia's coffee intake.  To find out how much he needs to reduce his intake, we need to figure out the difference between his current intake and the recommended amount. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **Let Octavia's daily coffee intake be represented by 'x'.**
* **Juan's current daily coffee intake is 10x.**
* **Juan's new daily coffee intake must be 4 cups.**

**To find the reduction, we need to find the difference between Juan's current intake and the new intake:**

* **Reduction = Juan's current intake - new intake**
* **Reduction = 10x - 4**


**Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by 10x - 4 cups.**

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the unknown quantities.

* Let 'A' represent Anna's goals.
* Let 'M' represent Mark's goals.
* Let 'R' represent Richie's goals.

We know the following:

* R = M + 20  (Richie scored 20 more than Mark)
* R = A + 45 (Richie scored 45 more than Anna)

Now we can use these equations to solve for the unknown variables.

We are given that R = 80.  Substituting the second equation into the first equation:

80 = M + 20 + 45

Simplifying the equation:

80 = M + 65

Solving for M:

M = 80 - 65
M = 15

Now we can find A:

A = R - 45
A = 80 - 45
A = 35

Finally, we can find the total goals:

Total goals = A + M + R
Total goals = 35 + 15 + 80
Total goals = 175

"Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.  He spends $5 on wooden action figures for the first three days, and then $2 on plastic action figures for the remaining days.  

To find the total number of action figures he has at the end of the week, we need to consider the number of wooden figures and the number of plastic figures.

* **Wooden figures:**  He spends $5/figure * number of figures = total cost for wooden figures.
* **Total cost for wooden figures:** $5/figure * number of figures
* **Money left:** $70 - (total cost for wooden figures)
* **Plastic figures:** Peter spends $2/figure * number of figures = total cost for plastic figures.
* **Total cost for plastic figures:** $2/figure * number of figures
* **Total cost for the week:** $5/figure * number of figures + $2/figure * number of figures
* **Total cost for the week:** $7/figure * number of figures
* **Total number of figures:** $70 / $5 = 14 wooden figures
* **Total number of figures:** $70 / $2 = 35 plastic figures

"Let's break down the food truck's profitability. 

First, we need to determine the cost per sandwich.  The cost of bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.  

Next, we need to consider the cost of cheese and condiments. They spend $30.00 on these per 10 sandwiches.  This means the cost per sandwich for cheese and condiments is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00.

Finally, we can calculate the total revenue. They sell 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each, resulting in a total revenue of $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. The total cost is $0.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $3.00.  Therefore, the net profit is $70.00 - $3.00 = $67.00.

"Let's break down the cost calculation step-by-step:

1. **Carpet Cost:** The carpet costs $12 per square foot, and the bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so the total area is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet.  The total cost of the carpet is 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592.

2. **Padding Cost:** The padding costs $2 per square foot, and the bedroom is 216 square feet, so the total cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

3. **Removal Cost:** The removal cost is $4 per square foot, and the bedroom is 216 square feet, so the total cost of removal is 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

4. **Installation Cost:** The installation cost is $34 per square foot, and the bedroom is 216 square feet, so the total cost of installation is 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7456.

5. **Total Cost:**  Adding all the costs together, the total cost of replacing the carpet is $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7456 = **$11344**.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step using algebraic notation:

*  Let 'x' represent the unknown number.

*  The problem states: ""This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.""

*  We can translate this into an equation:  (x + 10) / 5 * (20 - 12) = x

*  Simplify the equation: (x + 10) / 5 * 8 = x

*  Further simplification: (8x + 80) / 5 = x

*  Multiply both sides by 5: 8x + 80 = 5x

*  Solve for x: 3x = -80

*  Isolate x: x = -80 / 3

*  Therefore, the final value of the number train is -80/3.

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

The key is to represent the jelly bean quantities with variables. Let:

*  'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  'r' represent the number of red jelly beans.
*  'g' represent the number of green jelly beans.

We know the following:

*  'r' is 1% less than 'b', meaning r = 0.99b
*  'g' is 1% more than 'b', meaning g = 1.01b

**Setting up the Equation:**

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of all three: b + r + g = 4500

**Solving for 'b':**

Substitute the expressions for 'r' and 'g' into the equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combine like terms: 2.99b = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.99: b = 1500

**Finding the Difference:**

Now that we know 'b' (the number of blue jelly beans), we can find the difference between green and red jelly beans:

* Green jelly beans: g = 1.01b = 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: r = 0.99b = 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

**Answer:** The jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"The beanstalk exhibits exponential growth, meaning its height increases by a constant factor each day.  To find the number of days it takes to reach the window, we need to determine the power to which the growth factor is raised to reach the desired height. 

The initial height is 4 feet.  The beanstalk doubles in height each day, so the growth factor is 2.  We need to find the power to which 2 is raised to reach a height greater than the window. 

Let's consider the following:

* **Day 1:** 4 feet
* **Day 2:** 4 * 2 = 8 feet
* **Day 3:** 8 * 2 = 16 feet
* **Day 4:** 16 * 2 = 32 feet
* **Day 5:** 32 * 2 = 64 feet

"Let's solve this problem using a simple substitution.  

Let Jerry's current age be represented by the variable 'x'.  We know that he was 'x-5' years old five years ago.  The problem states that he is twice as old as he was five years ago.  This translates to the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Now, we can solve for 'x':

x = 2x - 10
x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.  In three years, he will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations.  

Let 'x' represent the measure of the smallest angle.  The other two angles can be represented as 2x and 3x respectively.  The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get: 6x = 180

Solving for x, we find: x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees.

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it measures 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total seats:** The auditorium has 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats.
* **Administrators:** One-fourth of the seats are occupied by administrators, so 72 seats * (1/4) = 18 seats are occupied.
* **Remaining seats:**  After the administrators occupy their seats, there are 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats left.
* **Parents:** One-third of the remaining seats are occupied by parents, so 54 seats * (1/3) = 18 seats are occupied.
* **Students:**  The remaining seats are occupied by students, so 54 seats - 18 seats = 36 seats.

**Answer:** There were 36 students in the auditorium.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Cost of cars:** 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000
* **Company's cost:**  The company paid 30% of the car's price, so they paid $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.
* **Profit per car:** The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost, so the profit per car is $25,000 - $75,000 = -$50,000.
* **Commission:** James earns a 10% commission on the profit, so his commission is -$50,000 * 0.10 = -$5,000.

"Let's break down the problem using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the price of a diamond Jewell.
* The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times the price of a diamond, so it's (4/5)x.
* The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so it's (1 - 4/5) * (4/5)x = (1/5) * (4/5)x = (4/25)x.

Now we know the price of a diamond is $2000.  We can substitute this into our equations:

* x = $2000

Now we can find the price of the gold and silver jewels:

* (4/5)x = (4/5) * $2000 = $1600
* (4/25)x = (4/25) * $2000 = $320

Finally, the total price is the sum of the three jewels:

* $2000 + $1600 + $320 = $4800


**Answer:** $4800

"Let's break down the problem using a simple algebraic approach.

* Let 't' represent the time it takes Tom to catch up to Bob.

*  The distance Tom needs to cover is the difference in their positions: 75 miles.

*  Tom's speed is 70 mph, and Bob's speed is 55 mph.

*  We can express the distance Tom covers in terms of time as: 70t

*  We can also express the distance Bob covers in terms of time as: 55t

*  Since they are closing the gap, the difference in their distances is equal to the distance Tom needs to cover: 75 - 55t = 70t

*  Solving for 't': 75 - 55t = 70t
*  Combining like terms: 75 = 125t
*  Dividing both sides by 125: t = 0.6 hours

**Answer:** It will take Tom **0.6 hours** to catch up with Bob.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the cooking time for rice.
* Pork takes 'x + 20' minutes to cook.
* Beans take 'x + (x + 20)/2' minutes to cook (half the combined time of rice and pork).

Now, we know the total cooking time is 30 minutes for rice plus the combined time of pork and beans.  

* Total time = x + (x + 20) + (x + (x + 20)/2) 

We can simplify this equation:

* Total time = 30 
* 3x + 20 + (x + 20)/2 = 30

Solving for x:

* 3x + 20 + (x/2) + 10 = 30

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the amounts of money each person has.

* Let 'A' represent Aurelia's money.
* Let 'K' represent Kassidy's money.
* Let 'R' represent Rayna's money.

We know:

* A = $120

"To find the number of days it takes for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we need to determine how many days it takes to grow 600 inches from its current height of 240 inches. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Daily growth:** The bamboo grows 30 inches per day.
* **Target height:** We want to reach 600 inches.

To find the number of days, we can use the following formula:

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the number of cookies each person has.

* Let 'M' represent the number of cookies Max has.
* Let 'C' represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
* Let 'S' represent the number of cookies Summer has.

We know the following:

* M = C + 12 
* S = M + 23
* C = 68 - 5

Now, let's substitute the values of M and C into the equation for S:

* S = (C + 12) + 23
* S = (68 - 5 + 12) + 23
* S = 85 + 23
* S = 108

Now, we can find the total number of cookies:

* Total cookies = M + C + S
* Total cookies = (C + 12) + (68 - 5) + 108
* Total cookies = (68 - 5) + 108 + (C + 12)
* Total cookies = 63 + 108 + (C + 12)
* Total cookies = 173 + (C + 12)
* Total cookies = 185 + C

We know that C = 68 - 5, so substitute that into the equation:

* Total cookies = 185 + (68 - 5)
* Total cookies = 185 + 63
* Total cookies = 248

Therefore, the total number of cookies is **248**.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the final dress length is 140cm after an extension and a lace trim.  We need to figure out the original length.

* **Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.**

* **The extension:**  The dress is extended by 50% of its original length, which means the extension is 0.50x.

* **The total length:** The final length is the original length plus the extension plus the lace trim.  This can be represented as: x + 0.50x + 20cm = 140cm

* **Simplify the equation:** Combine the 'x' terms: 1.50x + 20cm = 140cm

* **Solve for x:** Subtract 20cm from both sides: 1.50x = 120cm. Divide both sides by 1.50: x = 80cm

**Therefore, the dress was 80cm long in its original design.**

"Let's analyze the situation. Ron faces a cost of $120 for a fine if he fixes the pothole himself, and he'll need to purchase 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each, totaling $75.  

To determine his savings, we need to compare the total cost of fixing the pothole to the potential damage it could cause. 

The total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 (asphalt) + $120 (fine) = $195.  

The potential damage to his car is $450. 

Therefore, Ron would lose $195 - $450 = -$255.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total slices:** Bryce and his friends have 5 people, and each person eats 12 slices, so there are 5 * 12 = 60 slices.
* **Slices eaten:**  Bryce and two friends eat 2/3 of the pizza, which is (2/3) * 60 = 40 slices.
* **Slices remaining:**  After the first group eats, there are 60 - 40 = 20 slices left.
* **Slices eaten by the remaining friends:** The remaining two friends eat 3/4 of the remaining slices, which is (3/4) * 20 = 15 slices.
* **Slices left:**  Finally, we subtract the slices eaten by the remaining friends to find the final amount: 20 - 15 = 5 slices.

"To find the average time, we need to consider the relationship between the time it takes each animal to eat the sausages and their individual consumption rates. 

* **Cat's Consumption Rate:** The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes, meaning it eats 1 sausage every 30/9 = 1/3 of an hour.

* **Dog's Consumption Rate:** The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the time the cat takes, meaning it eats 1 sausage every (2/3) * 30/9 = 20/9 of an hour.

* **Average Consumption Rate:**  To find the average time, we need to find the average of the cat's and dog's consumption rates. 

* **Average Time:** The average time is the total time divided by the number of animals. 

**Therefore, the average time it takes for the cat and dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* Let Dora's age be represented by the variable 'd'.
* Dora's father's age is represented by '2d + 8'.
* Dora's mother's age is represented by '2d + 8 - 4'.

Now, we can simplify the expression for Dora's mother's age: 2d + 8 - 4 = 2d + 4

We know that Dora is 15 years old, so we can substitute this into our equations:

* 15 = d
* 2d + 8 = 2(15) + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
* 2d + 4 = 2(15) + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34

Finally, we can calculate the total combined age:

15 + 38 + 34 = 87

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87.

"Let's break down the problem using variables.

* Let 'S' represent the number of books Steven has.
* Let 'A' represent the number of books Alice has.
* Let 'C' represent the number of books Clara has.

We know the following:

* A = S + 6  (Alice has 6 more books than Steven)
* C = 2S (Clara has twice the number of books as Steven)
* C = 20 (We know Clara has 20 books)

"Let's break this down.  We know the total number of students is 80.  Since each class has the same number of students, we can represent the number of students in each class as 'x'.  

We are given that 40% of the students in each class are girls. This means that 0.40 * x represents the number of girls in each class.

We also know that the total number of girls is 32.  Therefore, we can set up an equation:

0.40 * x = 32

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

x = 32 / 0.40

x = 80

This means that each class has 80 students.  Since there are 80 students in total, and each class has 80 students, there are 48 boys in each class.

"Let's break down the problem using variables:

* Let 'C' represent the number of marbles Carl has.
* Let 'S' represent the number of marbles Sean has.
* We know that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so S = C/2.
* We also know that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so C = 4S.

Now we can use these equations to solve for the number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:

1. **Substitute:** Since S = C/2, we can substitute this into the equation C = 4S:
   C = 4 * (C/2) 
   C = 2C

2. **Solve for C:**  Subtract C from both sides:
   0 = C - 2C
   -C = 0
   C = 0

3. **Find the combined total:**  Since C = 0, we can substitute this back into the equation for S:
   S = C/2 = 0/2 = 0

4. **Calculate the combined total:**  Since both Carl and Cal have 0 marbles, their combined total is 0.

"Let's break down the problem using variables:

* Let 'x' represent the number of cases of shingles needed for the first house.
* The second house needs half as many as the first, so it needs x/2 cases.
* The third house needs double the amount of the first, so it needs 2x cases.

Now, the total number of cases is 250, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x/2) + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

(5/2)x + 2x = 250

Simplify:

(9/2)x = 250

Solve for x:

x = 250 * (2/9) = 55.56 (approximately)

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's consider the total number of cases needed for the first two houses.

The first house needs x cases, and the second house needs x/2 cases.  The total number of cases needed for the first two houses is x + (x/2) = 3.5x.

The third house needs 2x cases.  The total number of cases needed for all three houses is 3.5x + 2x = 5.5x.

We know the total number of cases needed is 250.  So, we can set up an equation:

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the relationship:**  We know George has 45% more pears than bananas. This means the number of pears is 1.45 times the number of bananas.

* **Setting up the equation:**  Let 'x' represent the number of bananas.  Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, he has 1.45x pears.

* **Solving for the number of pears:** We know George has 200 bananas.  Therefore, we can set up the equation: 1.45x = 200

* **Solving for x:**  Divide both sides of the equation by 1.45: x = 200 / 1.45 
   
* **Calculating the number of pears:**  Since x represents the number of bananas, we can find the number of pears: 1.45 * 200 = 290

* **Calculating the total number of fruits:**  George has 200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits.

"Let's break down the problem using variables. 

* Let 'd' represent the total distance to the vacation spot.
* The family drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour, so the distance driven is 50d.
* They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour, so the distance hiked is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Now, we know the total distance is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked: 50d + 30 = d.

Solving for 'd':
* 50d = d - 30
* 49d = -30
* d = -30/49

Since distance cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement.

"Let's break down this problem using a systematic approach.  

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'E' represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
*  Let 'A' represent the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
*  Let 'B' represent the number of berries Emma collects.
*  Let 'C' represent the number of berries Ava collects.
*  Let 'T' represent the time Ava takes to finish the level.

**Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  We know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: A = E + 8
*  We know that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: B = B + 3
*  We know that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower: T = T + 4

**Now, let's consider the points for each player:**

*  Ava gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on: 10 * A
*  Ava gets 5 points for each berry she collects: 5 * B
*  Ava gets 30 points for each second she takes to finish the level: 30 * (T - 4)

**Emma's points:**

*  Emma gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on: 10 * E
*  Emma gets 5 points for each berry she collects: 5 * B
*  Emma gets 30 points for each second she takes to finish the level: 30 * (T - 4)

**The difference in scores:**

*  The difference in scores is the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score.

**To find the difference in scores, we need to calculate the scores for each player and then subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.**

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

Let 'x' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.  Since he got twice as many orange fish as white fish, he bought 2x orange fish.

The total number of fish after adding the new fish is represented by the equation: 7 + x + 2x = 24.

Simplifying the equation: 3x + 7 = 24

Subtracting 7 from both sides: 3x = 17

Dividing both sides by 3: x = 17/3

Since we can't have a fraction of a fish, we need to find the whole number that satisfies the equation.  

**Answer:** Bob bought 5 white fish at the store.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally after they both work 20 hours.  

**Key Information:**

* Billy's initial hourly rate: $10
* Billy's first raise: $0.50 per hour
* Billy's anniversary raise: $1.00 per hour
* Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary.

"To find the overall pass rate, we need to consider the pass rates of each grade level and then calculate the total pass rate. 

* **Third Grade:** 340 out of 500 students passed, giving a pass rate of 340/500 = 0.68.
* **Fourth Grade:** 40 out of 100 students passed, giving a pass rate of 40/100 = 0.40.
* **Fifth Grade:**  The pass rate for fifth grade is twice that of the fourth grade, so it is 0.40 * 2 = 0.80.

Now, to find the overall pass rate, we add the pass rates of each grade level: 0.68 + 0.40 + 0.80 = 1.88.

Finally, we multiply this total by 100 to express it as a percentage: 1.88 * 100 = 188%. 


 
**Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is 188%.**

"Let's break down this problem using a systematic approach. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're given a recipe for a salt scrub, and we need to determine the amount of oil used.  We'll use variables to represent the quantities of each ingredient:

* **x:** Amount of zest
* **y:** Amount of salt
* **z:** Amount of sugar
* **o:** Amount of oil

**Key Relationships:**

* **Zest and Fragrance:**  The amount of zest is equal to the amount of fragrance.
* **Salt and Zest:** The amount of salt is twice the amount of zest.
* **Oil and Salt:** The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt.
* **Total Mixture:** The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.

**Solving for Oil (o):**

1. **Expressing Salt in Terms of Zest:** Since the amount of salt is twice the amount of zest, we can write:  y = 2x

2. **Expressing Oil in Terms of Salt:**  The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt, so: o = 2y

3. **Substituting:** We know y = 2x, so we can substitute this into the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x

4. **Finding the Value of x:**  We need to find the value of x, which represents the amount of zest.  We can use the fact that the amount of zest is equal to the amount of fragrance. 

**Final Answer:**

To find the exact amount of oil (o), we need to know the value of x (the amount of zest).  We can then use the equation o = 4x to calculate the amount of oil.

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations.  

Let's represent the number of cards PJ has with the variable 'x'.  We know that Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Now, solve for x:

7x = 329
x = 47

This means PJ has 47 cards.  To find Becca's cards, we substitute the value of x back into the equation for Becca's cards:

Becca's cards = 3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards. 


**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Shipping Cost:** The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  
   * Weight: 4 pounds
   * Cost per pound: $0.35
   * Total shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
   
2. **Mileage Cost:** The distance is 20 miles.
   * Cost per mile: $0.08
   * Total mileage cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60

3. **Total Cost:**  We need to add the shipping and mileage costs.
   * Total cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

4. **Refund Amount:** Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   * Purchase price: $32
   * Refund percentage: 75%
   * Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

5. **Final Cost:**  We subtract the refund amount from the total cost.
   * Final cost: $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Week 1:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
* **Week 2:** He produces half of Week 1's output, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He produces three times the output of Week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find the output for week 4, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"
"Here's how to solve this problem using the concept of proportional reasoning and rates:

**Understanding the Relationship**

The key is to recognize that the time it takes to travel a distance is directly proportional to the speed.  This means if we change the number of turtles, the time it takes to travel the same distance will change proportionally.

**Setting up the Proportion**

Let's use the following variables:

*  *x* = the speed of a kangaroo
*  *t* = the time it takes for *x* kangaroos to travel the distance

We know:

*  *t* = 18 hours (for *x* kangaroos)

**Finding the Time for Four Turtles**

*  The number of turtles is increased to 4, and their speed is halved. 
*  Let's represent the speed of a turtle as *y*. 
*  The time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance is: 
    *  *t* = Distance / *y* 
    *  We know the distance is the same for all the animals.

**Solving for the New Time**

*  We can use the relationship between speed, time, and distance to find the new time. 
*  The time for four turtles is: 
    *  *t* = Distance / *y* 
    *  We know the distance is the same for all the animals.

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the number of dishes each person makes.

* Let 'K' represent the number of dishes Kora makes.
* Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, so Rory makes 'K + 20' dishes.
* Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so Jada makes '2 * (K + 20)' dishes.

Now, we know that Kora makes 20 dishes.  We can substitute this into our equations:

* Rory makes K + 20 dishes.
* Jada makes 2 * (K + 20) dishes.

To find the total number of dishes, we need to add the number of dishes each person makes:

Total dishes = K + (K + 20) + 2 * (K + 20)

Simplifying the equation:

Total dishes = 3K + 20 + 2K + 40

"Let's break down the problem using variables to represent the unknown quantities.

* Let 'S' represent the number of socks Peter has.
* Let 'J' represent the number of socks Jack has.
* Let 'D' represent the number of dishes Jack has.

We are given the following information:

* J = 2D (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks)
* D = 2S (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks)
* S = 2J (Peter has twice as many socks as Jack)

Now, we can use these equations to solve for the number of socks and dishes.

* Substitute the value of D and J in terms of S from the first two equations into the third equation: S = 2 * (2D) = 4D
* Substitute the value of D in terms of S from the second equation into the equation above: S = 4 * (2S) = 8S
* Solve for S: 8S = S
* Therefore, S = 0. 

This means that Peter has 0 socks.

"Brenda's investment will grow to $975 after 3 years.  Here's how we can calculate that:

* **Simple Interest Formula:**  A = P(1 + r*t) 
   * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
    * P = $300
    * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (the interest rate is expressed as a decimal)
    * t = 3 years

* **Calculation:** A = 300 (1 + 0.75 * 3) = 300 (1 + 2.25) = 300 * 3.25 = $975

"To find Harry's weight, we need to work our way through the given information step-by-step. 

* **Carl's weight:** We know Carl is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.
* **Christian's weight:** Christian is 8 kg more than Carl, so Christian weighs 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.
* **Harry's weight:**  Harry is 5 kg less than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra. 

* Let 'J' represent the number of notebooks Joseph has.
* Let 'M' represent the number of notebooks Martha has.

We know:

* M = 3J (Martha has 3 times the number of notebooks Joseph has)
* M + 5 = 7 (Martha bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7)

Now we can solve for M:

1. Substitute the first equation into the second equation: 3J + 5 = 7
2. Subtract 5 from both sides: 3J = 2
3. Divide both sides by 3: J = 2/3

Now we can find the difference between Martha's and Joseph's notebooks:

* Martha has 3J = 3 * (2/3) = 2 notebooks.
* Joseph has 2J = 2 * (2/3) = 4/3 notebooks.
* The difference is 2 - 4/3 = 2 - 1.33 = 0.67 notebooks.

* **Number of nephews:** She wants to divide them equally among 6 nephews.
* **Husband's snack:** Her husband takes 4 cookies.
* **Cookies remaining:**  We need to find out how many cookies are left for the nephews.

To find the number of cookies each nephew gets, we can divide the total cookies by the number of nephews: 100 cookies / 6 nephews = 16.67 cookies per nephew. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a cookie, we need to adjust for the husband's snack.  

**Answer:** Each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

"Let's break down this problem using the principles of proportional reasoning and unit conversions.

**Understanding the Relationship:**

* We know the relationship between the number of masks and the material used for each mask type. 
* We need to find the total material needed for a specific number of masks.

**Setting up the Ratios:**

* Small masks: 4 masks require 2 yards of material.
* Large masks: 3 large masks require 2.25 yards of material.

**Calculating the Material Needed:**

* **Small masks:**  We need to find the total material needed for 20 small masks.
* **Large masks:** We need to find the total material needed for 8 large masks.

**Solving for the Total Material:**

* **Small masks:**  We can use the ratio of 2 yards of material per 4 small masks to find the material needed for 20 small masks. 
* **Large masks:** We can use the ratio of 2.25 yards of material per 3 large masks to find the material needed for 8 large masks.

**Final Calculation:**

* **Total Material:**  To find the total material needed, we need to add the material needed for the small masks and the material needed for the large masks.

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let Duncan's current age be represented by 'd' and Adam's current age be represented by 'a'.  

We know:

*  d - 8 = 2(a - 4)  (Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago)
*  d = 60 (Duncan's current age)

Now we can solve for 'a' (Adam's current age):

1. **Substitute the value of 'd' from the second equation into the first equation:** 60 - 8 = 2(a - 4)
2. **Simplify and solve for 'a':** 52 = 2(a - 4)

"Let's break down this problem using a systematic approach.

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
* Let Paul's age be represented by 'P + 10' (since he's 10 years older than John)
* Let John's age be represented by 'J'

**2. Formulate Equations:**

We know the following:

*  P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
*  P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

**3. Solve for the Ages:**

* Simplify the first equation: 2P + J = 100
* Substitute the second equation into the first equation: 2P + J = 100
* We can solve for J in the second equation: J = 100 - 2P
* Substitute this value of J into the second equation: P = P + 10 + (100 - 2P)
* Simplify and solve for P: P = 110 - 2P
* Combine like terms: 3P = 110
* Solve for P: P = 36.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, Peter's age is approximately 36.67 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step using algebra.

* **Step 1: Distance Swum**
   We know James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

* **Step 2: Swimming Time**
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

* **Step 3: Rest Time**
   Rest time is half the swimming time, so it's 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

* **Step 4: Remaining Distance**
   The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.

* **Step 5: Speed for Remaining Distance**
   The speed for the remaining distance is half of his original speed, so it's 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour.

* **Step 6: Time for Remaining Distance**
   Time = Distance / Speed
   Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

* **Step 7: Total Time**
   Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Remaining time
   Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

**Answer:** 17 hours

"Let's break down the problem using variables. 

* Let Deanna's age be represented by 'D'.
* Let Marcus's age be represented by 'M'.
* Let Leo's age be represented by 'L'.

We know the following:

*  M = D/2  (Marcus is half of Leo's age)
*  M = D - 5 (Marcus is five years younger than Deanna)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* D/2 = D - 5

Solving for D:

* D = 2 * (D - 5)
* D = 2D - 10
* 10 = D 

We now know Deanna is 26 years old.  

To find Leo's age, we can use the first equation:

* M = D/2

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let's represent the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as B, A, and D respectively.  We know the following:

* **B = A + 20:** Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo.
* **B = D + 10:** Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar.
* **A + D + B = 45:** The total points scored by the three players is 45.

We can use these equations to solve for the individual scores. 

**Solving for A:**

From the first equation, we can substitute B in the second equation:
* D + 10 = (A + 20) 
* D + 10 = A + 20
* A = D - 10

**Substituting into the Total Points Equation:**

Now, substitute the value of A from the previous step into the third equation:
* (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45
* 3D + 10 = 45

**Solving for D:**

Simplify and solve for D:
* 3D = 35
* D = 35/3 
* D = 11.67 (approximately)

**Finding Azibo's Score:**

Now that we know D, we can find A:
* A = D - 10
* A = 11.67 - 10
* A = 1.67 (approximately)


**Answer:**  Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to consider the time interval and his stapling rate. 

* **Time Interval:** The stapling period spans from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 3 hours.
* **Stapling Rate:** Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.

**Calculation:**

1. **Minutes in the Stapling Period:** 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes
2. **Total Reports Stapled:** 180 minutes / 15 minutes/report = 12 reports

**Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 12 reports.**

"To determine Kim's total sleep time, we need to consider the time she was awake and the time she slept. 

* **Awake Time:**  She was awake from 2:15 am to 2:38 am, a duration of 23 minutes.
* **Bathroom Break:** She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, meaning she slept for 18 minutes.

**Therefore, Kim slept for 18 minutes that day.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Measuring spoons:** Jonathan has 2/3 the number of measuring spoons as measuring cups.  Since he has 2 dozen cups, he has (2/3) * 12 = 8 measuring spoons.
* **Total utensils:**  He has 2 dozen cups + 8 measuring spoons = 32 utensils in total.
* **Pedro's gift:**  Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro.
* **Remaining utensils:**  He has 32 - 6 = 26 utensils remaining.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial occupancy:** The hospital has 1000 beds, and 1/5 are occupied, meaning 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds are occupied.
* **Daily admissions:**  50 patients are admitted each day.
* **Total occupancy in two weeks:** Over two weeks, the hospital sees 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients.
* **Unoccupied beds:**  The hospital has 1000 - 700 = 300 unoccupied beds.


**Therefore, the hospital has 300 unoccupied beds after two weeks.**

"Let's break down this percentage problem.  

If Kelly is correct, and Courtney overstated the number of attendees by 20%, we need to find the actual number of people who attended.  

To do this, we can think of the overstatement as a percentage of the original number.  

* **The overstatement is 20% of the original number, which is 48.**
* **To find the actual number of attendees, we need to subtract the overstatement from the original number.**

Therefore, the actual number of attendees is 48 - (20/100) * 48 = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. 

**Answer:** 38.4

"Let's break down this problem using variables to represent the number of balls each person carried.

* Let 'J' represent the number of balls Jordan carried.
* Let 'Z' represent the number of balls Jason carried.
* Let 'Y' represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.

We know the following:

* J = 2Z  (Jordan carried twice as many as Jason)
* Z = Y * 2  (Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey)

We also know that the total number of balls carried is 7.  

We can express this as an equation: J + Z + Y = 7

Now, let's substitute the values we know:

* J = 2Z
* Z = Y * 2

Substituting these into the equation: 
2Z + Z + Y = 7

Simplifying:
3Z + Y = 7

We can solve for Y:
Y = 7 - 3Z

Now, we need to find a value for Z that makes this equation true.  We know Jason carried 2 balls, so:
Z = 2

Substituting Z back into the equation:
Y = 7 - 3 * 2
Y = 7 - 6
Y = 1

Now that we know Y = 1, we can find J:
J = 2 * Z
J = 2 * 2
J = 4

Finally, we can find the total number of balls brought by the coach:
Total balls = J + Z + Y
Total balls = 4 + 2 + 1
Total balls = 7

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Total holes dug:** The pirates dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.
* **Holes after filling in:** They filled in 2 holes, so they dug 31 - 2 = 29 holes.
* **Holes on the fourth day:** The island had 4 times the number of holes at the end of the first day, meaning they dug 29 * 4 = 116 holes.

"Let's break down the problem using a system of equations. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips each of the two people get.
* The third person gets x + 15 corn chips.

We know that the total number of corn chips is 265.  We can set up an equation:

2x + (x + 15) = 265

Now, solve for x:

3x + 15 = 265
3x = 250
x = 83.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a corn chip, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's assume the number of corn chips each of the two people get is 'x'.  The third person gets x + 15.  We know that the total number of corn chips is 265.  We can set up an equation:

2x + (x + 15) = 265

3x = 250
x = 83.33

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Supplies:** Jen spends $400 on supplies.
* **Travel Cost:** The travel cost is 50% more than the supplies.  This means the travel cost is 1.50 times the cost of the supplies.
* **Total Cost:** The total cost of the trip is the sum of the supplies and the travel cost.

To find the cost of travel, we can set up an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the cost of travel.
* The cost of travel is 1.50 times the cost of supplies, so: x = 1.50 * $400 
*  The total cost is $400 (supplies) + x (travel) = $400 + 1.50 * $400 = $400 + $600 = $1000

**Answer:** $1000

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
    * Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

* **Formulate equations:**
    * We know that Alex has 5 more Pokemon than Stan:  A = S + 5
    * Stan has 13 fewer Pokemon than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch: S = 4W - 13
    * The total number of Pokemon caught is 339: A + S + W = 339

* **Solve for S (Stan's catch):**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
    * Substitute the second equation into this equation: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
    * Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339
    * Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339
    * Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365
    * Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56 (We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon)

* **Find Stan's catch:**
    * Substitute the value of W back into the second equation: S = 4(41) - 13
    * Simplify: S = 164 - 13
    * Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Episodes:** The show has half as many episodes as minutes per episode.  
* **Total Time:**  To find the total time, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode.

Therefore, John will spend 20 minutes watching the show. 


**Answer:** 20 minutes

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the bird's movements in a systematic way. 

First, we need to break down the journey into its constituent segments:

* **Segment 1:** The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
* **Segment 2:** The bird turns and flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
* **Segment 3:** The bird turns again and flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

To find the total distance, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment and then add them together.

**Here's how to calculate the distance for each segment:**

* **Segment 1:** Distance = 30 miles/hour * 10 hours = 300 miles
* **Segment 2:** Distance = 18 miles/hour * 2 hours = 36 miles
* **Segment 3:** Distance = 22 miles/hour * 5 hours = 110 miles

**Finally, add the distances from each segment to find the total distance:**

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let 'R' represent the number of cherries Richard has, 'J' represent the number of cherries Jerry has, and 'B' represent the number of cherries Robert has.

We know:

* B = R + 10 (Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard)
* B + R + J = 60 (The total number of cherries)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* (R + 10) + R + J = 60

Combining like terms:

* 2R + J = 50

We also know that:

* B = R + 10 

We can substitute this into the equation above:

* 2R + J = 50

Now we have two equations with two variables.  We can solve for J. 

* 2R + J = 50
* J = 50 - 2R

We can substitute this value of J back into the equation B = R + 10:

* B = R + 10

We can substitute this value of B back into the equation 2R + J = 50:

* 2R + (50 - 2R) = 50

Simplifying:

* 50 = 50

This equation is true for any value of R.  Therefore, we can't determine a specific number of cherries for Jerry.

"Let's break down Sunny's earnings.

* **Saturday:**  Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
* **Sunday:** Sunny sold 5 more gingerbread boxes than Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.
* **Total Earnings:** To find Sunny's total earnings, we need to calculate the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie separately and then add them together. 

**Earnings from Gingerbread:**
*  He sold 10 boxes of gingerbread at $6 per box, so he earned 10 * $6 = $60.

**Earnings from Apple Pie:**
* He sold 6 boxes of apple pie at $15 per box, so he earned 6 * $15 = $90.

**Total Earnings:**
* Sunny's total earnings for the two days are $60 + $90 = $150.

* **Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age when he saw the comet the first time.** This translates to the following equation: Bill's age at the second sighting = 3 * (Dad's age at first sighting)

* **We can now set up an equation to solve for x:**
   * Bill's age at the second sighting = 3 * (Dad's age at first sighting)
   * 90 = 3 * 30 

* **Solving for x:**
   * 90 = 90 

* **Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Ratios:**

* **First Plane:** The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. This means it flies to Greece for (3/4) of its total flights. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.
* **Other Plane:** The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of flights the first plane makes.

**Setting up the Equation:**

Let's use 'x' to represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.  

* **First Plane:**  
    * Greece: (3/4)x
    * France/Germany: (1/4)x
* **Other Plane:** 
    * Poland: 22 trips

**Solving for x:**

We know the other plane makes 22 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

22 = (1/2) * x

Solving for x:

* 22 * 2 = x
* x = 44

**Answer:** The first plane makes 44 flights in a day.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Tobias:** Howls for 20 seconds.
* **Chikote:** Howls for twice as long as Tobias, so she howls for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
* **Igneous:** Howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.
* **Total:**  The total howl time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:** 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra.

* Let  'x' represent Wilfred's age.
* We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * (5) = 10 years.
* The total age of the group is 20 years.
* We also know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

Now, we can set up an equation: 
x + 3 + 4 + 10 = 20

Simplifying the equation:
x + 17 = 20

Solving for x:
x = 20 - 17
x = 3

Therefore, Wilfred is **3 years old**.

"Let's break down this problem using the concept of ratios and proportions.

**Understanding the Relationship:**

The key is to recognize that the ratio of the size of an adult's slice to a kid's slice is 2:1. This means for every 2 parts of the watermelon an adult gets, a kid gets 1 part.

**Setting up the Proportion:**

We can express this relationship as a proportion:

*  Adult's slice size / Kid's slice size = 2 / 1

**Solving for the Unknown:**

Let's represent the size of a kid's slice with the variable 'x'.  We can then set up the proportion:

*  2x / x = 2 / 1

Simplifying the equation:

* 2 = 2

This equation is true, meaning the ratio of the adult's slice to the kid's slice is consistent.

**Calculating the Percentage:**

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to express the adult's slice size as a fraction of the total watermelon.  Since the total slices are 6, and each adult gets 2x slices, we can express this as:

* (2x / 6) * 100%

**Final Answer:**

The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is **(2x/6) * 100%**

"Let's break down the problem.  We need to find the volume of the pool, then multiply it by the cost per gallon.

**1. Volume Calculation:**

The volume of a rectangular prism (like a swimming pool) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.  

* Length = 25 feet
* Width = 14 feet
* Depth = 4 feet

Therefore, the volume is: 25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

**2. Conversion to Gallons:**

We know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons.  

* Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10392 gallons.

**3. Cost Calculation:**

The cost per gallon is $0.10.  

* Total cost = Volume in gallons * Price per gallon
* Total cost = 10392 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $1039.20

**Answer:** The cost to fill the pool is $1039.20.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Day 1:** Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of that amount, which is (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.  Together they pump a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

* **Day 2:** Wanda pumps 2/3 of the amount from day 1, which is (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumps 1/3 of the amount from day 1, which is (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.  Together they pump a total of 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

* **Total pumped:**  The total amount pumped in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.

* **Gallons remaining:** To find the remaining gallons, subtract the total pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

"Let's break down this problem using algebra and percentages. 

**Let 'x' represent the initial charge of the power bank.**

* **Step 1:  The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours.** This means the power bank lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge. 
* **Step 2: The power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours.** This means the power bank lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.
* **Step 3: We know the power bank has 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.**  

**To find the initial charge, we can set up an equation:**

*  Let 'x' be the initial charge.
*  After 5 hours, the charge is 100% - 45% = 55%
*  After 3 hours, the charge is 100% - 21% = 79%
*  We know the final charge is 28%

**Solving for x:**

We can use the information about the final charge to solve for x. 

*  We know the final charge is 28% of the initial charge. 
*  We can set up an equation: 0.28 = (x - 0.45x) / 100 
*  Simplify the equation: 0.28 * 100 = x - 0.45x
*  Solve for x: 28 = 0.55x
*  Divide both sides by 0.55: x = 50 


**Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank was 50%.**

"Jamaar has $10.00 and wants to buy plums.  Let's break down the cost of the fruits he already has:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

The total cost of the fruits he has already purchased is $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Now, let's calculate how much money Jamaar has left: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75.

Finally, we can determine how many plums he can buy: $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"The price of carrots increases by 5% each year.  To find the price after three years, we need to calculate the price for each year and then add them together.

* **Year 1:** The price increases by 5% of the initial price, so the price after one year is 1.05 times the original price.
* **Year 2:** The price increases by 5% of the price from the previous year, so the price after two years is 1.05 times the price from year one.
* **Year 3:** The price increases by 5% of the price from year two, so the price after three years is 1.05 times the price from year two.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years is $139.76.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**
* **Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.**

**Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.**

"The probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of the following events:

* **No homework:**  The probability of a substitute teacher being present is 50%, and the probability of an extension being given is 40%.  The probability of these two events happening is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.
* **No homework and no extension:** The probability of no homework is 0.5, and the probability of no extension is 100% (since the teacher will not give an extension). The probability of these two events happening is 0.5 * 1 = 0.5.
* **Homework:** The probability of a normal teacher being present is 100% - 50% = 50%, and the probability of an extension being given is 40%. The probability of these two events happening is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.
* **Homework and extension:** The probability of homework is 100% - 50% = 50%, and the probability of an extension is 40%. The probability of these two events happening is 0.5 * 0.4 = 0.2.

"Let's analyze the situation.  

Jim's college degree increases his annual income from $25,000 to $75,000, a significant boost.  However, he incurs $200,000 in loan payments over four years.  To determine the time it takes to recoup these expenses, we need to consider the lost income from not working during his college years.

The total amount Jim needs to earn is the sum of his loan payments and the lost income: $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

To calculate the time required to reach this amount, we can use the following formula:

Time = Total Amount to Earn / Annual Income

In this case, Time = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let:

*  *x* represent the amount the first person received.
*  *y* represent the amount the second person received.
*  *z* represent the amount the third person received.

We know the following:

*  *y = x + $80* (The second person received $80 more than the first)
*  *z = 2(x + $80)* (The third person received twice the amount the second person received)
*  *(x + y + z) / 3 = $1920* (The total amount divided by the number of people equals the share of each person)

Now, let's substitute the values of *y* and *z* into the equation:

*(x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920*

Simplify and solve for *x*:

* (4x + $160) / 3 = $1920

"Let's analyze the problem.  We know the total number of balls Rory retrieved is 19.  Let's represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set with the variable 'x'.  

* **First set:**  He retrieved 4 more balls than the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.
* **Third set:** He retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We can express the total number of balls as: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. Combine like terms: (5/2)x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
3. Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

To find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we can use the information that the first set is x + 4.

"Let's break down the problem using variables. 

* Let 'J' represent the number of slices Jake ate.
* Let 'B' represent the number of slices Becky ate.
* Let 'S' represent the number of slices Silvia ate.

We know the following:

* B = J + 3  (Becky ate 3 more than Jake)
* S = 2J (Silvia ate twice as many as Jake)
* B + J + S = 4 * 8 (They shared 4 pizzas, each with 8 slices)

Now we can substitute the expressions for B and S into the last equation:

(J + 3) + J + 2J = 32

Combine like terms:

4J + 3 = 32

Subtract 3 from both sides:

4J = 29

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 7.25

Since we can't have a fraction of a slice, we need to adjust our assumption.  Let's assume that Jake ate 7 slices.

Now we can find the number of slices Becky and Silvia ate:

* B = 7 + 3 = 10
* S = 2 * 7 = 14

Finally, calculate the total number of slices eaten:

10 + 7 + 14 = 31

Adding these costs together, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $150 + $120 + $12 = $282.

"James receives 80 emails daily.  20% of these emails are non-actionable, meaning he doesn't need to respond to them.  He responds to the remaining emails.  

To find the number of emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we need to consider the following:

* **Emails requiring a response:** 80 emails * 0.80 = 64 emails
* **Emails responded to:** 64 emails 

Therefore, James responds to 64 emails in a 5-day work week. 


**Answer:** 64

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Glee Club:** They ate 70% of 20 pizzas, which is (70/100) * 20 = 14 pizzas.
* **Football Team:** They ordered twice the number of pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
* **Football Team's Consumption:** They ate 80% of their pizzas, which is (80/100) * 40 = 32 pizzas.
* **Total Pizzas Left:**  To find the number of pizzas left, we subtract the pizzas eaten by both groups: 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Small coupons:** Anthony sends 700 small coupons.
* **Big coupons:** He sends twice the number of small coupons, so he sends 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.
* **Cost of small coupons:** Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so he spends 700 * 0.05 = 35 cents on small coupons.
* **Cost of big coupons:** Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so he spends 1400 * 0.15 = 210 cents on big coupons.
* **Total postage cost:**  The total cost is 35 cents + 210 cents = 245 cents.

"Let's break down the cost of Kayla's party. 

First, we need to determine the total number of guests. Kayla has 25 classmates, plus 7 from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 45 guests.  

Next, we need to account for the additional guests.  We subtract the 4 people who can't attend from the total number of guests: 45 guests - 4 guests = 41 guests.

Finally, we calculate the cost. The base fee for the theater is $125.  For the additional guests, we multiply the number of guests by $6 each: 41 guests * $6/guest = $246.  

Adding the base fee and the cost of additional guests, the total cost is $125 + $246 = $371.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Maggie's spending:**  We know she spent 1/4 of her money, which is represented as 1/4 * $60 = $15.
* **Riza's spending:** Similarly, Riza spent 1/3 of her money, which is 1/3 * $60 = $20.
* **Total spending:**  Their combined spending is $15 + $20 = $35.
* **Remaining money:**  To find their remaining money, we subtract their total spending from their initial amount: $60 - $35 = $25.

Therefore, the two of them have $25 left.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Roses:**  Roses cost $2 each, and Jenny bought 15 roses.  The total cost of the roses is 15 * $2 = $30.
* **Payment:** Jenny paid with five $5 bills, totaling 5 * $5 = $25.
* **Change:**  The change should be calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total paid.  The change is $25 - $30 = -$5. 

**The problem states that Jenny has a negative change. This means that she does not have enough money to pay for the roses.**

"Let's break down the train schedule to determine Paul's wait time.

* **First train:** Arrives at 10 minutes past the hour. It stays for 20 minutes.
* **Second train:** Arrives 30 minutes after the first train, meaning it arrives at 1:00 PM. It stays for 10 minutes.
* **Third train:** Arrives 60 minutes after the first train, meaning it arrives at 1:30 PM. It leaves immediately.
* **Fourth train:** Arrives 20 minutes after the third train, meaning it arrives at 2:00 PM. This is the train Paul needs.

Therefore, Paul's total wait time is 10 + 10 + 60 + 20 = **100 minutes**.

"Let's break down the problem using algebra.  

Let 'x' represent Frankie's score. We know that Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.  We also know that Binkie's score is 90.

We can set up an equation: 
x = 2 * 90 + 15

Simplifying the equation:
x = 180 + 15
x = 195

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 'x' represent the number of feet of fence Sam has.
*  Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fence.

We know that the total length of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation: 
  x + (x + 60) = 100

Simplifying the equation:
  2x + 60 = 100

Solving for 'x':
  2x = 40
  x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find out how much is left for Sam, we can subtract Harry's fence from the total fence: 100 - 80 = 20 feet.


**Answer:** Sam has 20 feet of fence left.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Trekking Bikes:**  We know 1/2 of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so we have 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.
* **BMX Bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, which is 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
* **MTB Bikes:**  The remaining bikes are MTB bikes, so we have 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.
* **Revenue Calculation:**
    * MTB Revenue: 105 MTB bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
    * BMX Revenue: 45 BMX bikes * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
    * Trekking Revenue: 150 Trekking bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

* **Total Revenue:**  $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500

"To determine the number of bales left in the field, we need to consider the farmer's and the truck's contributions. 

* **Farmer's contribution:** The farmer produces 5 bales per hour, and they work for 6 hours, resulting in 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales.
* **Truck's contribution:** The truck picks up 3 bales per hour, and it works for 6 hours, resulting in 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales.
* **Total bales:**  The farmer's bales plus the truck's bales equals 30 bales + 18 bales = 48 bales.
* **Bales remaining:**  Since the farmer and truck pick up a total of 48 bales, there are 0 bales left in the field.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Second child's height:** The second child is 2 inches taller than the first, who is 6 feet tall.  This means the second child is 6 feet + 2 inches = 6 feet 2 inches tall.
* **Third child's height:** The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall.  Therefore, the third child is 6 feet 2 inches - 5 inches = 6 feet 7 inches tall.
* **Fourth child's height:** The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall.  This means the fourth child is 6 feet 7 inches + 3 inches = 6 feet 10 inches tall.
* **Convert to inches:**  The fourth child is 6 feet 10 inches = 72 inches + 10 inches = 82 inches tall.

"Let's break this down.  We know the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.  This means the T-Rex ate half of what was left after the velociraptors had their share.  

To find the original amount of meat, we need to consider the following:

* **The T-Rex ate half of the remaining meat.**  
* **The velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat.**

Let's represent the original amount of meat as 'x'.  

* **The T-Rex ate half of the remaining meat:**  x / 2
* **The velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat:** (x / 2) / 2 = x / 4

We know the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so:

* **x / 2 - (x / 4) = 270**

Now we can solve for x:

1. **Combine the fractions:** (2x / 4) - (x / 4) = 270
2. **Simplify:** x / 4 = 270
3. **Multiply both sides by 4:** x = 1080

**Therefore, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate.**

"Let's break down the problem.  

* **Area of the North and South walls:** 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet
* **Area of the East and West walls:** 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet
* **Total area of the walls:** 80 square feet + 40 square feet = 120 square feet
* **Gallons of paint needed:** 120 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 6 gallons
* **Cost of paint:** 6 gallons * $12/gallon = $72

Therefore, it will cost $72 to paint the room.

"The key to solving this problem is understanding that the trains are moving in opposite directions, meaning their distances from each other are constantly changing.  

To find the distance between the trains after 3 hours, we need to consider the combined effect of their individual speeds.  

**Here's how to approach it:**

* **Distance = Speed x Time**

* **Faster train:** 60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles
* **Slower train:** 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

* **Total distance:** 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

**Therefore, the trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours.**

"The difference in time it takes to ride the slides is determined by the difference in their respective speeds and the length of the slides. 

* **Biggest slide:** 300 feet, 60 feet/minute
* **Second biggest slide:** 240 feet, 80 feet/minute

To find the difference in time, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide.

* **Biggest slide:** Time = Distance / Speed = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes
* **Second biggest slide:** Time = Distance / Speed = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

The difference in time is 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down Sheila's credit card transaction step-by-step:

1. **Initial Balance:** Sheila starts with a balance of $85.00.

2. **Return:** She returns an item for a credit of $15.00. This reduces her balance.

3. **Frying Pan Discount:** The frying pan is on sale for 20% off its original price of $20.00.  The discount is calculated as 20/100 * $20.00 = $4.00.  The sale price is then $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

4. **Towel Discount:** The towels are discounted by 10% of their original price of $30.00. The discount is calculated as 10/100 * $30.00 = $3.00. The final price of the towels is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

5. **Total Cost:** The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

6. **Final Balance:**  To find the final balance, we add the cost of the new purchases to the initial balance and subtract the return amount.  The final balance is $85.00 - $15.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we need to work with the percentage of boys and the total population. 

* **Understanding the Relationship:**  We know that 40% of the school's population consists of boys. This means that the remaining 60% represents the girls.

* **Calculating the Total:**  We can use the following proportion: 
   * 40/100 = 240/x  (where x is the total number of students)
   * Cross-multiply: 40 * x = 240 * 100
   * Simplify: 40x = 24000
   * Solve for x: x = 24000 / 40 = 600 students

* **Finding the Number of Girls:**  Since the total population is 600 students, and 40% are boys, the number of girls is: 600 - 240 = 360 girls.


**Answer:** There are **360** girls in the school.

"Let's break down this problem using a systematic approach.

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline paint.
* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah paints.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

* We know that Arnold and Madeline paint the same number of eggs:  x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah paint a total of 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
*  The total number of eggs painted is 56: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**3. Solve for 'y':**

* Simplify the second equation: 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* Isolate 'y': 2y = 44 - 2x
* Solve for 'y': y = 22 - x

**4. Solve for 'x':**

* Substitute the value of 'y' from step 3 into the first equation: x + x = 2x
* Simplify: 2x = 2x
* Solve for 'x': x = 11

**5. Solve for 'Camden's' eggs:**

*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12
*  Camden painted 22 - 11 + 12 = 23 eggs

1. x + x - 7 + 4x - 28 = 37
2. 6x - 35 = 37
3. 6x = 72
4. x = 12

We now know the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  To find the length of the red rope, substitute the value of 'x' back into the expression for the red rope:

Red rope length = 4(x - 7) = 4(12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

"Let's break down this problem using algebra.

* Let 'x' represent the amount of money Ronnie had initially.
* Rissa had thrice the amount Ronnie had, so she had 3x dollars.
* After each of them gave an equal amount to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. This means she gave away (1 - 4/5) = 1/5 of her money. 
* We can express this mathematically as: 3x - (1/5) * 3x = 4/5 * 3x
* Simplifying the equation: 3x - (3/5)x = (12/5)x
* We know Rissa had $12 left after giving to her sister, so we can express this as: 3x - (1/5) * 3x = 12/5 * 3x
* Simplifying the equation: 3x - (3/5)x = 12/5 * 3x
* Combining like terms: (10/5)x - (3/5)x = 12/5 * 3x
* Simplifying: 7/5x = 12/5 * 3x
* Simplifying further: 7/5x = 36/5x
* Solving for x: 7/5x - 36/5x = 0
* Combining like terms: -29/5x = 0
* Multiplying both sides by 5: -29 = 0
* This equation has no solution.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total paint:** The mural uses 12 pints of paint in total.
* **Yellow paint:** Half the mural is yellow, meaning it uses 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints.
* **Equal colors:**  Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, they each represent 12 pints / 4 colors = 3 pints.
* **Red paint:**  To find the amount of red paint, we need to consider the total amount of paint and the amount of yellow paint.  The red, white, and purple paint represent 3 pints each, and the yellow paint represents 6 pints.  Therefore, the red paint represents 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Bedrooms:** Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so the area of one is 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.
* **Living Room:** The living room is 5 times larger than a bedroom, so its area is 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.
* **Total Area of Bedrooms:** The four bedrooms have a combined area of 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.
* **Total Area of the House:** The total area of the house is the sum of the bedroom area and the living room area, plus the area of the rest of the house.  This is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

First, we need to find the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus purchased.  He bought 4000 gallons at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost is 4000 * 3.5 = $14,000.

Next, we need to figure out how much milk was spoiled.  He bought 4000 gallons and 2/5 of that was spoiled, so he had 4000 * (2/5) = 1600 gallons spoiled.

Finally, we can calculate the refund amount.  The total cost was $14,000, and he returned 1600 gallons, so the refund is $14,000 - (1600 * 3.5) = $14,000 - $5,600 = $8,400.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

* **Let Colin's current age be represented by 'C'.**
* **Let Wendy's current age be represented by 'W'.**

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now""**  This translates to the equation: W = 5(C + 7)
2. **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""** This translates to the equation: C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

Now, we can solve for our two unknowns. 

**Solving the system of equations:**

* **Substitute the first equation into the second equation:**  Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

* **Simplify and solve for C:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 5 = (5/3)C
   * (2/3)C = 5
   * C = 25/2

**Therefore, Colin is currently 12.5 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem using some geometry and estimation principles.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to determine the error in Tim's guess about the number of red jelly beans in the jar.  

**Key Information:**

* **Jar Dimensions:** The jar is a square with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
* **Jelly Bean Volume:** Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches.
* **Packing Efficiency:** The jelly beans are packed efficiently, meaning we need to account for this when calculating the total volume.
* **Red Jelly Beans:** The jar contains 900 red jelly beans.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Jar's Volume:**  The volume of a square-based box is calculated by side * side * height.  So, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

2. **Calculate the Volume of Jelly Beans:**  We need to consider the packing efficiency.  The volume of the jelly beans is calculated by multiplying the jar's volume by the packing efficiency.  This means the volume of the jelly beans is 540 * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

3. **Calculate the Number of Jelly Beans:**  We can now determine the number of jelly beans by dividing the volume of the jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.  This gives us 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

4. **Calculate the Error:**  The difference between the estimated number of jelly beans (2880) and the actual number (900) is 2880 - 900 = 1980.

**Answer:** Tim's guess was **1980** jelly beans off.

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach.

**Understanding the Relationship:**

* Jason's success hinges on a direct relationship between the number of calls he makes and the number of customers who visit the dealership. 
* We need to find the number of calls required to generate the desired number of customers.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of calls Jason needs to make.
* We know that for every 25 calls, he gets 1 customer.
* We also know that for every 2 customers who visit, 1 customer buys a car.

**Solving for 'x':**

1. **Customers from Calls:**  We need to find the number of customers Jason needs to convert from his calls.
   *  We know he needs to convert 15 cars, and for every 2 customers who visit, 1 buys a car.
   *  Therefore, he needs to convert 15 cars / 2 = 7.5 customers.

2. **Calls to Convert Customers:**  We need to find the number of calls required to convert these 7.5 customers.
   *  He gets 1 customer for every 25 calls.
   *  Therefore, he needs to make 7.5 customers * 25 calls/customer = 187.5 calls.

**Answer:** Jason needs to make 188 calls to achieve his goal.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
    * Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered.

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    * We know he gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: p = 14 + 2 = 16
    * We know the total number of items is 29: t + p + beakers = 29

* **Solve for the number of beakers:**
    * We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 + 16 + beakers = 29
    * Simplify: 24 + beakers = 29
    * Subtract 24 from both sides: beakers = 5

* **Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers. 


**Therefore, Igor lost 5 beakers.**

"Let's break down the problem using variables. Let 'x' represent Vanessa's speed in miles per minute.  Since Aaron is twice as fast, his speed is 2x.  

We know Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron ran 2 miles.  We can set up an equation:

* Vanessa's time = Distance / Speed
* Vanessa's time = 4 miles / x miles/minute
* Aaron's time = Distance / Speed
* Aaron's time = 2 miles / 2x miles/minute = 1/x minutes

We are given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.  We can use this information to solve for x.

* 1/x = 16 minutes

To find Vanessa's time, we can substitute the value of x we just found into the equation for Vanessa's time. 

* Vanessa's time = 4 miles / x miles/minute = 4 / (1/x) minutes = 4x minutes

Now, we can solve for x. 

* 4x = 16 minutes
* x = 4 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took **4 minutes** to complete her part of the race.

"The vendor made a profit of 25% on the 50 watermelons, meaning the selling price was 125% of the cost price.  

To find the selling price per watermelon, we can set up a simple equation:

* **Selling Price = Cost Price * (1 + Profit Percentage)**

Let's plug in the values:

* Selling Price = $80 * (1 + 0.25)
* Selling Price = $80 * 1.25
* Selling Price = $100

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for **$100**.

"Let's break down the problem using variables:

* Let John's current age be represented by 'j'
* Let James's current age be represented by 'j1'
* Let Dora's current age be represented by 'd'

We know:

* j = 51 (John's current age)
* j1 = 2d (James is twice Dora's age)
* d = 9 (Dora's current age)

We also know that Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so:

* d + 3 = 12

Solving for d:

* d = 12 - 3 = 9

Now, we can find James's age:

* j1 = 2 * d = 2 * 9 = 18

Finally, to find the youngest son's age in 3 years:

* youngest son's age = j - 32 + 3 = 51 - 32 + 3 = 22

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Time:**  We need to consider the time it takes to peel oranges, not the number of oranges. 
* **Units:**  We're comparing the number of oranges peeled by each person, not the time it takes to peel a specific number of oranges.

**Therefore, the key is to compare the number of oranges peeled by each person in an hour.**

**Answer:**  Since both Ana and Jane peel oranges at a rate of 1 orange per minute, they will have peeled the same number of oranges after an hour.

"Let's break down the cost:

1. **Discount:** The radiator is discounted by 80%, meaning the price is reduced by 80% of its original value.  
   *  $400 * 0.80 = $320 

2. **Price after discount:** The discounted price is $400 - $320 = $80.

3. **Mechanic's labor:** The mechanic charges $50 per hour and the job takes 3 hours.
   * $50/hour * 3 hours = $150

4. **Total cost:** The final cost is the discounted price plus the labor cost.
   * $80 + $150 = $230


**Answer:** $230

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

*  The total number of animals is 20:  c + w = 20
*  The total number of legs is 70: 2c + 4w = 70

Now we can solve for 'c' using these equations. 

**Solving for 'w' in the first equation:**

*  c + w = 20
*  w = 20 - c

**Substituting this value of 'w' into the second equation:**

* 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
* 2c + 80 - 4c = 70
* -2c = -10
* c = 5

**Answer:** There are **5** chickens on the farm.
