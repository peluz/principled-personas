"Josh's investment in the house is a classic example of a potential loss.  Here's why:

The initial investment of $80,000 represents the purchase price of the property.  The subsequent $50,000 in repairs are a direct cost associated with improving the property's value.  However, the 150% increase in value is a significant factor in determining the profit.  

The increase in value is calculated by multiplying the original purchase price by 1.50, which represents a 150% increase.  This means the house is now worth $120,000.  

However, the total cost of the investment is $130,000, which is the sum of the purchase price and the repair costs.  This means Josh incurred a loss of $10,000.

"Let's analyze the situation. Carla's initial download rate is 2 GB/minute.  

First, we need to determine the time spent on the initial download phase. This is 40% of the total download size, which is 200 GB.  

* Time spent on initial download: (40/100) * 200 GB = 80 GB
* Time spent on initial download: 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Next, we need to account for the restart due to the Windows update. This adds 20 minutes to the total download time.

* Total time spent on download: 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Finally, we need to calculate the remaining download time. This is the difference between the total download size and the already downloaded portion.

* Remaining download: 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB
* Time spent on remaining download: 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

Therefore, the total download time is 60 minutes. 


**Answer:** 60 minutes

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Initial Trip:** John travels for 3 hours at 60 mph, covering a distance of 180 miles.
* **Return Trip:** He then drives for 4 hours at 80 mph, covering a distance of 320 miles.
* **Traffic:**  He experiences 2 hours of standstill traffic at 0 mph, resulting in a distance of 0 miles.
* **Final Segment:** He then drives for 30 minutes at 30 mph, covering a distance of 30 miles.

To find the total distance traveled, we need to consider the initial trip, the return trip, and the final segment. 

**Therefore, the total distance traveled is 180 miles + 320 miles + 30 miles = 530 miles.**

* **Mini Cheesecakes:** 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen cost 6 * 12 = 72 mini cheesecakes.

Finally, we sum the costs of each type of pastry: $68 * 36 + $80 * 24 + $55 * 72 = $2448 + $1920 + $3960 = $8328.

Therefore, the total cost of the pastries is $8328.

"To determine the number of years it takes for Carlos to start earning money on his lemon tree, we need to consider the net profit generated annually. 

The annual profit is calculated by subtracting the annual expenses from the annual earnings.  

* **Earnings:** 7 lemons * $1.50/lemon = $10.50
* **Expenses:** $3.00

Therefore, the annual profit is $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50.

To break even, Carlos needs to earn more than his expenses.  

The break-even point is reached when the annual profit is equal to the annual expenses.  

Therefore, Carlos will start earning money on his lemon tree after 2 years.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  

* **Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.**

* **Green House:** She sold 1/3 of her total, leaving (2/3)x.

* **Red House:** She sold 2 more than the green house, meaning she sold (5/3)x.

* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, which is (1/2) * (2/3)x.

* **Total Sold:**  The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is (1/3)x + (5/3)x + (1/2) * (2/3)x = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2.

* **Remaining:**  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (2/3)x + (5/3)x + (1/2) * (2/3)x = 5.

* **Solving for x:** Simplifying the equation, we get (2/3)x + (5/3)x + (1/3)x = 5. Combining like terms, we have (10/3)x = 5.  Multiplying both sides by 3/10, we get x = 15.

"The breakdown of student enrollment in the dance class is as follows:

* **Contemporary Dance:** 20 students * 20% = 4 students
* **Students Remaining:** 20 students - 4 students = 16 students
* **Jazz Dance:** 16 students * 25% = 4 students
* **Hip-Hop Dance:** 16 students - 4 students = 12 students

Therefore, 12 students represent the total number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.  

To calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop by the total number of students and multiply by 100%:

(12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%

"To determine Marissa's required speed for the remaining distance, we need to consider the total distance and time she wants to spend on the trail.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **Total distance:** 12 miles
* **Distance already covered:** 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles)
* **Desired average speed:** 4 miles per hour

We can use the following formula to calculate the required speed:

"Mishka's total expenditure on clothing can be calculated by summing the individual costs of each item.  The cost of the shorts is $16.50 per pair, and she purchased 3 pairs, resulting in a cost of 3 * $16.50 = $49.50.  Similarly, the cost of the pants is $22.50 per pair, and she purchased 3 pairs, resulting in a cost of 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.  Finally, the cost of the shoes is $42.00 per pair, and she purchased 3 pairs, resulting in a cost of 3 * $42.00 = $126.00.  Therefore, the total cost of all the clothing items is $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that the cost of the two pairs of heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots.  We are also given the price of one pair of heels, which is $33.  

Let 'x' represent the cost of the boots.  The cost of the second pair of heels is twice the price of the first pair, so it costs 2 * $33 = $66.  The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $99.  

Therefore, we can set up an equation: x = $99 - $66.  Solving for x, we find that the cost of the boots is $33. 



**Answer:** $33

"Let's break down this problem using a ratio-based approach.  

The ratio 7:11 represents the ages of Darrell and Allen.  This means for every 7 units of Darrell's age, Allen has 11 units.  

We are given that their combined age is 162.  Let's represent their current ages as 7x and 11x respectively.  

The equation for their combined age is: 7x + 11x = 162

Simplifying the equation: 18x = 162

Solving for x: x = 162 / 18 = 9

Now, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 11 * 9 = 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age in 10 years will be 109. 


**Answer:** 109

"To determine the average guess, we need to consider the three individual guesses and their respective values.  

Let's break down the problem:

* **First guess:** 80
* **Second guess:** 20 more than half the first guess, which is 40. Therefore, the second guess is 40 + 20 = 60.
* **Third guess:** 25% more than the first guess, which is 80.  The third guess is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100.

Finally, we sum the three guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.  

The average of these three guesses is 240 / 3 = 80.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let 's represent the number of silver coins.  Since Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver, we can represent the number of gold coins as 's + 30'.  The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold, so we have the equation:

* s + (s + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation:

* 2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

* 2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

* s = 40

Now, we can find the number of gold coins:

* s + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

"The cost of Terry's yogurt consumption over 30 days can be determined by first calculating the cost per yogurt and then multiplying that by the number of yogurts consumed.  

The sale price of 4 yogurts for $5.00 implies a unit price of $1.25 per yogurt.  Therefore, the total cost for 30 days is:

* **Cost = (Price per yogurt) * (Number of yogurts consumed) * (Number of days)**

This translates to: $1.25/yogurt * 30 yogurts * 30 days = $37.50. 


**Answer:** $37.50

"Let's break down the problem to determine John's running speed. 

* **Daily Distance:** John runs 3 hours on the first day, and the remaining two days he runs half as much, meaning he runs 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours per day.
* **Total Daily Distance:**  He runs 1.5 hours/day * 2 days = 3 hours.
* **Total Weekly Distance:**  John runs 60 miles per week.
* **Average Speed:**  To find his average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 60 miles / 9 hours = 6.67 miles per hour.

**Answer:** 6.67 miles per hour.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Dana's running speed:**  We know Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed.  Let's denote her walking speed as 'w'.  Therefore, her running speed is 4w.
* **Dana's skipping speed:**  We are given that her skipping speed is half her running speed, so her skipping speed is 4w/2 = 2w.
* **Distance traveled in six hours:**  We need to find the total distance Dana covers in six hours.  
    *  She runs for 2 hours at a speed of 4w, covering a distance of 4w * 2 = 8w miles.
    *  She walks for 4 hours at a speed of w, covering a distance of w * 4 = 4w miles.
* **Total distance:**  The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances from running and walking. 

Therefore, the total distance Dana travels in six hours is 8w + 4w = 12w miles. 

**To find the answer, we need to find the value of 'w'.** 

We know Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour.  Since her skipping speed is half her running speed, we can set up the equation: 2w = 3 miles/hour. Solving for 'w', we get: 
w = 3 miles/hour / 2 = 1.5 miles/hour.

**Finally, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation for total distance:**

Total distance = 12w = 12 * 1.5 = 18 miles.

"Charlie's net profit is determined by the difference between his total revenue and total cost.  

First, we need to determine the total revenue generated from selling the candles.  He sells each candle for $2.00, and he makes 20 candles, so his total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of producing the candles.  He uses 2 pounds of beeswax at a cost of $10.00 per pound, so his total cost is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.

Finally, we can calculate his net profit by subtracting his total cost from his total revenue: $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know John purchased blue ties at a cost of $40 each, and he spent a total of $200 on these ties.  This means he bought 200 / 40 = 5 blue ties.  

Since red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, we can calculate the cost of a single red tie as $40 * 1.50 = $60.  John purchased 10 red ties, so the total cost of these ties is 10 * $60 = $600.

Therefore, the total cost of all the ties is $600 (red) + $200 (blue) = $800.

"Let's break down the problem. Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his bag.  We know the comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and the toys weigh 1/2 pound each.  

To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we can use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the weight of the comic books:**  He removes 30 comic books, and each weighs 1/4 pound, so the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.

2. **Calculate the remaining weight:**  He needs to remove 15 pounds total, and the comic books weigh 7.5 pounds, leaving 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of toys:**  Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, and he needs to remove 7.5 pounds, so he needs to remove 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys.


**Answer:** Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.

"To determine Tommy's total earnings, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of product and then sum those amounts. 

* **Brownie Revenue:**  The revenue from selling brownies is calculated by multiplying the number of brownies sold by the price per brownie: 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $129.
* **Cheesecake Revenue:** Similarly, the revenue from cheesecake sales is calculated as 23 slices * $4/slice = $92.
* **Total Revenue:**  The total revenue is the sum of the brownie revenue and the cheesecake revenue: $129 + $92 = $221.

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221.

"The monthly installment cost can be determined by considering the total cost of the phones and the interest accrued over the three-month period. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones.  Since each phone costs $150, the total cost is 5 * $150 = $750.

Next, we need to calculate the total interest accrued over the three-month period.  The interest rate is 2% per unit, so the total interest is (2/100) * $750 = $15.

Finally, to determine the monthly payment, we add the total cost and the interest to get $750 + $15 = $765. 


Therefore, Shiela will pay $765 each month for the three-month installment.

"To determine Artie's earnings, we need to consider the revenue generated from each type of flower and then sum the amounts. 

* **Marigolds:**  Since he sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, he earns 12 pots * $2.74/pot = $32.88.
* **Petunias:**  He sells petunias for $1.87 per pot, so he earns 9 pots * $1.87/pot = $16.83.
* **Begonias:**  He sells begonias for $2.12 per pot, resulting in 17 pots * $2.12/pot = $36.14.

Finally, we sum the earnings from each type of flower: $32.88 + $16.83 + $36.14 = $85.85. 


Therefore, Artie will make $85.85.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given that Sarah performs 4 times the laundry volume compared to David, and that Raymond performs half the laundry volume compared to Sarah.  

To find the difference in laundry volume between Raymond and David, we can utilize the following steps:

1. **David's laundry:**  We know Sarah performs 4 times the laundry volume of David. Therefore, David performs 400 pounds / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

2. **Raymond's laundry:**  Raymond performs half the laundry volume of Sarah. Therefore, Raymond performs 400 pounds / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

3. **Difference:** The difference in laundry volume between Raymond and David is 200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds.

"To determine the cost savings, we need to compare the cost per flower for both package options.  

The cost per flower for the 3-flower package is $0.83, while the cost per flower for the 2-flower package is $0.50.  

To find the cost of 18 flowers using the 2-flower package, we multiply the number of flowers by the cost per flower: 18 flowers * $0.50/flower = $9.00.

To find the cost of 18 flowers using the 3-flower package, we multiply the number of flowers by the cost per flower: 18 flowers * $0.83/flower = $14.94.

The difference in cost is $14.94 - $9.00 = $5.94. 

Therefore, Vincent saves $5.94 by purchasing 18 flowers using the 2-flower package.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Grace weighs 125 pounds and Alex weighs 2 pounds less than four times Grace's weight.  

To find Alex's weight, we can set up an equation: 
* Alex's weight = 4 * Grace's weight - 2

Substituting Grace's weight, we get:
* Alex's weight = 4 * 125 - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds

Finally, to find their combined weight, we simply add their individual weights:
* Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight = 125 + 498 = 623 pounds

Therefore, their combined weight is 623 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that a team played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost.  This translates to the following equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of games they lost.
*  Their wins are then represented by 'x + 8'.
*  The total number of games is the sum of wins and losses, so we have the equation: x + (x + 8) = 22

Solving for 'x', we get:

* 2x + 8 = 22
* 2x = 14
* x = 7

Therefore, they lost 7 games.  Since their wins are 'x + 8', we find their wins are 7 + 8 = 15.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **First alarm:**  The alarm rings for a duration of *x* minutes.
* **Second alarm:** The second alarm rings for 3 * x = 3x minutes.
* **Third alarm:** The third alarm rings for 1/2 * 3x = 1.5x minutes.

The total number of rings is the sum of the durations of all three alarms: 
* x + 3x + 1.5x = 5.5x

We know the total number of rings is 22.  Therefore, 5.5x = 22. 

Solving for x, we get:
* x = 22 / 5.5 = 4

The alarm rings for 4 minutes on the first alarm. 

The second alarm rings for 3 * 4 = 12 minutes.

The third alarm rings for 1.5 * 4 = 6 minutes.

The total number of rings is 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

"Let's break down the salary increase calculation.  

The company's policy is a simple compound interest-based increase.  We need to calculate the salary increase for each year, then add it to the previous year's salary. 

* **Year 1:**  Sylvie's salary increases by 10% of $600, so she gets $600 * 1.10 = $660.
* **Year 2:** Her salary increases by 10% of $660, so she gets $660 * 1.10 = $726.
* **Year 3:** Her salary increases by 10% of $726, so she gets $726 * 1.10 = $798.60.

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be **$798.60**.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know that Marilyn sold 10 times the number of copies Harald did.  This means we can represent the number of copies Harald sold with the variable 'x'.  The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + 10x = 88,000

Combining like terms, we get:

11x = 88,000

To solve for 'x', we divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold **8,000** copies.

"Let's break down the problem. Christina needs to account for a 25% reduction in attendees due to potential no-shows.  This means she needs to determine the number of gift bags needed for the actual number of guests attending. 

The number of guests attending is 16.  We know that 1/4 of the guests don't show up, so we can calculate the number of guests who will be present: 16 guests * (1 - 1/4) = 12 guests.

Christina needs to purchase 9 gift bags to accommodate the 12 guests.  The cost of each gift bag is $2.  Therefore, the total cost is 9 gift bags * $2/gift bag = $18.00.

"To determine the total potato salad needed, we must first consider the consumption of both adults and children.  

* **Adult Consumption:**  The picnic hosts 20 adults, each consuming 10 lbs of potato salad.  Therefore, the total adult consumption is 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs.
* **Child Consumption:**  Children consume half the amount of adults, so each child consumes 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs.  With 5 children, the total child consumption is 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs.
* **Total Consumption:**  The total potato salad needed is the sum of adult and child consumption: 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.

"Let's break down the problem.  

We are given that Lee's time for the 400-meter hurdles is 38 seconds, and he runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald.  We are also told that Gerald's diet has improved his speed by 10%.  

Let's denote Gerald's original time as 'x' seconds.  Since Lee's time is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's, we can express Lee's time as 'x + 2' seconds.

We can now set up an equation to represent the relationship between the two times:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 36

Now, we need to determine Gerald's new time after his diet improvement.  Since his diet has improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his new time as:

Gerald's new time = x + 0.1x = 36 + 0.1(36) = 36 + 3.6 = 39.6 seconds.


**Answer:** Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 39.6 seconds.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Define variables:** Let 'd' represent the number of dogs and 'c' represent the number of cats. 
* **Establish relationships:** We know that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats. This translates to the equation:  r = d + c - 12, where 'r' is the number of rabbits.
* **Utilize given information:** We are given that there are 60 dogs.  This means d = 60.
* **Solve for cats:**  We know there are 2 cats for every dog, so c = 2 * d = 2 * 60 = 120.
* **Calculate rabbits:** Substitute the values of 'd' and 'c' into the equation for rabbits: r = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168.
* **Calculate total pets:** The total number of pets is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: 60 + 120 + 168 = 348.


Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

"Let's break down the problem to find the solution.  

We are given that Henry baked 110 cookies after dropping 5 and that he baked 2x cookies this year, which is twice the number he baked last year.  We can express this mathematically as:

2x + 15 - 5 = 110

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 50

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

"Let's break down this problem using a ratio-based approach.  

The ratio 7:13 represents the proportion of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water in Katy's coffee recipe.  We are given that she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar.  

To find the number of teaspoons of sugar used, we can utilize the following:

* **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 7:13 signifies that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.
* **Setting up the Equation:**  Let 'x' represent the value of one part of the ratio. We know that 7x represents the total teaspoons of sugar used.  We can express this as: 7x = 120 teaspoons.
* **Solving for x:**  Divide both sides of the equation by 7 to isolate 'x': x = 120 / 7 = 17.14 (approximately).

Therefore, Katy used approximately 17.14 teaspoons of sugar.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each on the first day, totaling 10 vehicles.
* The total number of vehicles at the port on the second day is 30.
* We need to determine the number of containers brought in on the second day.

To find this, we can use the following logic:

* The total number of vehicles on the second day is the sum of the vehicles from the first day and the additional vehicles brought in.
* We know the total number of vehicles on the second day is 30.
* We also know that each container has 5 vehicles. 
* Therefore, we can calculate the number of containers brought in on the second day by dividing the total number of vehicles by the number of vehicles per container.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Adrien's initial salary:** We know Adrien's salary was $40,000 four years ago.
* **Adrien's salary increase:**  His salary increased by 40% in the four years, meaning his current salary is 1.40 times his initial salary.
* **Lylah's initial salary:**  Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Lylah's initial salary as a multiple of Adrien's initial salary. 
* **Total salary:**  To find the total salary, we need to consider both Adrien and Lylah's salaries.

**Solution:**

1. **Adrien's current salary:**  Adrien's current salary is $56,000.
2. **Lylah's current salary:**  Lylah's current salary is $4300.
3. **Total salary:**  The total salary four years later is $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300.


**Therefore, the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
* Over the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.
* This totals 6 hours/day * 2 days = 12 hours of sleep.
* The remaining days of the week, she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, so she slept 12 + 1 = 13 hours.
* Finally, we add up all the sleep: 8 + 12 + 13 = 33 hours.

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of 33 hours throughout the week.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

* **Watermelon Cost:**  The cost of a watermelon is three times the price of a pepper, and we are given that a pepper costs $15. Therefore, a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.

* **Orange Cost:** The price of an orange is $5 less than a watermelon, so it costs $45 - $5 = $40.

* **Total Cost of Watermelons:** Dillon buys 4 watermelons at $45 each, resulting in a total cost of 4 * $45 = $180.

* **Total Cost of Peppers:** Dillon buys 20 peppers at $15 each, resulting in a total cost of 20 * $15 = $300.

* **Total Cost of Oranges:** Dillon buys 10 oranges at $40 each, resulting in a total cost of 10 * $40 = $400.

* **Total Cost:**  The total cost of all the items is $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.


Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $880.

"The hospital's profit can be determined by analyzing the revenue generated from patient charges and the revenue generated from doctor's fees.  

First, we need to calculate the total revenue from patient charges.  The hospital sees 500 patients per day, each receiving an average of 24 minutes of care.  This translates to a total of 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes of patient care per day.  

Next, we need to convert this time into hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours of patient care per day.  

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour for their services.  Therefore, the total revenue from patient charges is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

The hospital also incurs costs associated with the care provided.  The hospital pays its doctors $150 per hour for their services.  The total revenue from doctor's fees is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

Finally, the hospital's profit is the difference between the total revenue from patient charges and the total revenue from doctor's fees.  Therefore, the hospital's profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Box 1:** Johnny has 500 pieces.
* **Box 2:** This box has 3 times the number of pieces as Box 1, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
* **Box 3:** This box has 1/4 the number of pieces as Box 1, so it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the number of pieces from each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces. 


**Answer:** 2125

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Initial bee departure:** Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours.
* **Return of bees:**  The next 6 hours see 1/2 the number of bees leaving, meaning 30 / 2 = 15 bees return.
* **Double the departure:** The next 6 hours see twice the number of bees leaving as the initial 6 hours, resulting in 30 * 2 = 60 bees leaving.
* **Total departure:**  The total number of bees leaving the hive is 30 + 60 = 90.
* **Return in the last 6 hours:**  Debra observes 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.

"Let's break down this problem to determine the time difference. 

First, we need to convert all distances to feet, as the problem states that Steve's bike speed is given in feet per minute.  

* Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
* Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Next, we can calculate the time it takes Steve to travel to his home. 

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Now, we can calculate Tim's travel time.

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Finally, we find the difference in time.

* Difference = Tim's time - Steve's time
* Difference = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes

Therefore, the winner will be waiting at their house for **4** minutes.

"Shawnda's revenue can be calculated by considering the number of tires inflated for each type of bicycle. 

* **Bicycles:** 5 individuals require inflation for both tires, resulting in 5 * 2 = 10 tires inflated.  
* **Tricycles:** 3 individuals require inflation for all their tires, resulting in 3 * 3 = 9 tires inflated.
* **Unicycle:**  One individual requires inflation for a single tire.

The total number of tires inflated is 10 + 9 + 1 = 20.  

The total revenue generated is 20 * $0.25 = $5.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Seagull's Consumption:** The seagull consumed half of Dave's initial 14 fries, leaving 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

2. **Pigeons' Interference:** Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, resulting in a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries consumed.

3. **Remaining Fries:** After the seagull and pigeons, there were 14 - 7 - 9 = 8 fries remaining.

4. **Raccoon's Action:** The raccoon took 2/3 of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 8 = 5.33.  Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we round down to 5.

5. **Final Count:** The ants took one fry, leaving 8 - 1 = 7 fries.

**Therefore, the initial pack contained 7 french fries.**

"To determine the total class time Kimo spends in a semester, we need to consider the class schedule for each day of the week. 

* **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:** Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day, totaling 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.
* **Tuesday and Thursday:** He has two 2-hour classes each day, totaling 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day = 4 hours/day * 2 days/week = 8 hours/week.
* **Total weekly class time:** 9 hours/week + 8 hours/week = 17 hours/week.
* **Total class time for the semester:** 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours.

Therefore, Kimo spends a total of **272 hours** attending classes in a semester.

"To determine the total length of Bill's baked goods, we first need to express all measurements in a consistent unit.  Since the problem asks for the total length in feet, we will convert all lengths to feet. 

* **Rolls:** 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches
* **Croissants:** 120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
* **Baguettes:** 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette * 12 inches/foot = 1440 inches

Next, we sum the lengths in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches. 

Finally, we divide the total length in inches by the conversion factor (12 inches/foot) to obtain the total length in feet: 3360 inches / 12 inches/foot = 280 feet.

Blake's distance is calculated by considering the total distance covered in his back-and-forth runs.  We can calculate this by multiplying the number of runs by the distance per run. 

Kelly's distance is calculated by considering the distance covered in her runs to the 40-yard line and back. We can calculate this by multiplying the number of runs by the distance per run. 

Finally, we can find the difference in distance by subtracting Kelly's total distance from Blake's total distance.

"To determine Raphael's total expenditure, we must sum the individual costs of each item.  

* Pens: 4 units at $1.50 per unit = $6.00
* Notebooks: 2 units at $4.00 per unit = $8.00
* Bond Paper: 1 unit at $20.00 = $20.00

Therefore, the total cost is $6.00 + $8.00 + $20.00 = $34.00. 


**Answer:** $34.00

"To determine the number of tadpoles Finn can see, we need to consider the changes in the population.  

* **Initial:** Finn starts with 11 tadpoles.
* **Emerging:** 6 tadpoles emerge from the lily pad.
* **Hiding:** 2 tadpoles hide under the rock.

Therefore, the total number of tadpoles Finn observes is 11 + 6 - 2 = 15. 


**Answer:** 15

"The water depth on Wednesday is determined by the change in depth from Tuesday to Wednesday.  

* **Tuesday's depth:** The tank had 17 feet of water on Monday, and on Tuesday, it had 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet of water.
* **Wednesday's depth:** On Wednesday, the depth was two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday, which is (2/3) * 24 feet = 16 feet. 


**Answer:** 16 feet

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Anakin's catch:** Anakin collected 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish.
* **Locsin's catch:** Locsin's starfish count is 5 fewer than Anakin's, meaning he collected 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  Locsin's seahorse count is 3 fewer than Anakin's, resulting in 6 - 3 = 3 seahorses.  Finally, Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, meaning he collected 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

* **Total fish:** To find the total number of fish caught by both individuals, we sum their individual catches: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 for Anakin and 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 for Locsin.

* **Combined total:**  The total number of fish caught by both individuals is 19 + 13 = 32.


**Answer:** 32

"The price of the bag of marbles increases exponentially.  We can model this with a geometric sequence.  The price after *n* months is given by:

* P(n) = 20 * (1.20)^n 

where P(n) is the price after *n* months.

To find the price after 36 months, we substitute n = 36:

* P(36) = 20 * (1.20)^36 

Calculating this gives us:

* P(36) ≈ $164.00 


**Therefore, the bag of marbles would cost approximately $164.00 after 36 months.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Cost of a red car:**  We are given that one red car costs $4.
* **Cost of an action figure:** We are also given that one action figure costs $5.
* **Cost of three action figures:**  The cost of three action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.
* **Cost of the doll:**  The doll's cost is equal to the cost of three action figures, so it costs $15.
* **Total cost of all toys:** The total cost of all the toys is the sum of the individual costs: $4 (red car) + $15 (action figures) + $15 (doll) = $34.

**Answer:** $34

"The question presents a classic cost-benefit analysis scenario.  Jackie faces a trade-off between the potential savings of doing her taxes herself and the cost of hiring an accountant. 

Let's break down the problem:

* **Option 1: DIY Taxes:**  Jackie loses 3 hours of freelance work, resulting in a loss of $35/hour * 3 hours = $105 in potential income.
* **Option 2: Hiring an Accountant:** The accountant charges a fixed fee of $90.

To determine the financial advantage of hiring an accountant, we need to compare the total cost of the accountant's services to the potential savings from doing her taxes herself. 

**The key is to consider the net gain or loss.**  

**Answer:**  The accountant's fee of $90 is a fixed cost, and the potential loss of $105 from freelance work is a variable cost.  Therefore, the accountant's fee is a fixed cost, and the potential loss of $105 from freelance work is a variable cost.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let 'S' represent Seth's current age and 'B' represent Brooke's current age.  We are given the following information:

* **S = 2B:**  This tells us Seth's age is twice Brooke's age.
* **S + B + 2 = 28:** This represents the sum of their ages in two years.

To solve for Seth's age, we can use substitution.  

1. **Substitute:** Since we know S = 2B, we can substitute this into the second equation: 
   2B + B + 2 = 28

2. **Simplify:** Combine the 'B' terms:
   3B + 2 = 28

3. **Isolate 'B':** Subtract 2 from both sides:
   3B = 26

4. **Solve for 'B':** Divide both sides by 3:
   B = 8.67 (approximately)

5. **Find 'S':** Now that we know B, substitute it back into the equation S = 2B:
   S = 2 * 8.67
   S = 17.34 (approximately)

**Therefore, Seth is approximately 17.34 years old.**

"To determine the total time required for Billy to prepare the potatoes, we need to consider the time spent on peeling and cutting.  

* **Peeling:**  The time to peel each potato is 1.5 minutes, and he's working with 60 potatoes, so the total peeling time is 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes.
* **Cutting:**  Each potato takes 5 seconds to cut, and he's working with 60 potatoes, so the total cutting time is 60 potatoes * 5 seconds/potato = 300 seconds.

To find the total time, we need to add the time for peeling and cutting: 90 minutes + 300 seconds = 5400 seconds. 

**Therefore, it will take Billy 5400 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes.**

"Let's analyze Zaid's financial situation.  

* **Rent:** Zaid spends 1/4 of his $6000 monthly salary on rent, which is $6000 * (1/4) = $1500.
* **Car Fuel:** He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, amounting to $6000 * (1/3) = $2000.
* **Total Expenses:**  His total expenses are $1500 + $2000 = $3500.
* **Remaining Funds:**  After covering his expenses, Zaid has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.
* **Charity Donation:** He donates half of his remaining funds to charity, which is $2500 / 2 = $1250.
* **Money After Charity:**  After the donation, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250.
* **Total Given to Daughter and Wife:**  He gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, totaling $200 + $700 = $900.
* **Final Remaining Money:**  Finally, he has $1250 - $900 = $350 left.


**Therefore, Zaid has $350 remaining after all his expenses and donations.**

"The faster team will win by 38 seconds. 

Here's why:

The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between the times of each runner on the less well-rounded team.  The time of each runner is increasing by a constant amount (3 seconds) as we move from the first to the fourth runner.  This means we can calculate the total time for the less well-rounded team by simply adding the times of each runner. 

The faster team, however, has a consistent time of 55 seconds for each runner.  To find the difference in time, we simply subtract the total time of the less well-rounded team from the total time of the faster team.

"To determine the relative likelihood of these events, we need to consider the individual probabilities of each event and then calculate the difference. 

* **Event 1: Rolling a number greater than 3:**  There are three favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of six total possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability of this event is 3/6 = 1/2.

* **Event 2: Rolling two even numbers in a row:**  There are three even numbers (2, 4, 6) and the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 = 1/2.  The probability of rolling another even number on the second roll is also 1/2.  Therefore, the probability of this event is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

The difference in probabilities is 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.  

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100%: (1/4) * 100% = 25%.


**Answer:** The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

* **Total straw used:** 160 pieces
* **Straw used with hamsters:** 50 pieces
* **Straw used with rats:** 160 - 50 = 110 pieces
* **Rats per cage:** 110 pieces / 6 pieces/rat = 18.33 rats

Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. 

**Therefore, there are 6 rats in each cage.**

"Let's break down the problem to determine the number of bags sold.

* **Cost:** The trader incurs a cost of $2 per bag for transportation, and the cost per bag of wheat is $20.  
* **Revenue:** The trader sells each bag for $30.
* **Profit:** The trader's profit is $400.

We can express this information mathematically as follows:

* Total cost = 20x (where x is the number of bags)
* Total revenue = 30x
* Total expenses = 22x (20x + 2x)
* Profit = Total revenue - Total expenses

We can now set up an equation to solve for x:

400 = 30x - 22x

Simplifying the equation:

400 = 8x

Solving for x:

x = 400 / 8

x = 50

Therefore, the trader sold **50** bags.

"Let's break down the cost analysis.  

* **Tickets:** The friends spent $20.25 on three tickets.
* **Food:** They spent $4.50 less on food than tickets, so the food cost was $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
* **Rides:** The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two rides, totaling $33 * 2 = $66.
* **Total Cost:** The total cost of the trip is the sum of the ticket, food, and ride expenses: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.00.
* **Cost per Person:**  To find the cost per person, we divide the total cost by the number of people: $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.


Therefore, each person paid $34.00.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.  

First, we need to determine the cost of the half dozen plates.  The cost per plate is $6000, and we have 6 plates, so the total cost is $6000 * 6 = $36000.

Next, we need to find the cost of 20 dozen cups.  We know the cost of half a dozen plates is $36000, and the cost of 20 dozen cups is $1200 less than that, so the cost of 20 dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

Finally, we can calculate the cost per cup.  The total cost of 20 dozen cups is $34800, and there are 240 cups in 20 dozen, so the cost per cup is $34800 / 240 = $145.

"To determine the number of lawn mowing sessions required for Sara to afford the desired items, we need to consider her total earnings and the cost of the jacket and shoes. 

First, we need to calculate her total earnings from babysitting and lawn mowing.  She earns $5 per babysitting session and 4 sessions, totaling $20.  Additionally, she earns $4 per lawn mowing session, and we need to determine how many sessions she needs to complete to reach her goal.

The total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + (2 * $20) = $70.  To determine how many lawn mowing sessions she needs to complete, we need to calculate the difference between her total earnings and the cost of the items.  

She needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more.  She earns $24 per lawn mowing session, so she needs to complete $60 / $24 = 2.5 lawn mowing sessions. 

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 3 times to afford the jacket and shoes.

"The problem presents a classic example of a system of equations that, while seemingly straightforward, can lead to inconsistencies.  Let's break down the given information and analyze the potential issues.

The problem states that Jerry has a total of 42 eggs collected each day.  This is a crucial piece of information.  We are given the number of eggs produced by each type of chicken, but we are not given the total number of chickens.  

The problem also states that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This is a key piece of information that we can use to set up a system of equations. 

**The issue:** The problem statement is inconsistent.  We are given a total number of eggs collected, but we are also given a relationship between the number of red and white chickens.  This relationship is not consistent with the total number of eggs collected. 


**Conclusion:**  The problem as stated is not solvable.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to consider the perimeter of the park.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Therefore:

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Given that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, the time spent walking is:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.


**Answer:** 5 hours

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can break down the problem step-by-step. 

* **Day 1:** Sloane observed 100 customers.
* **Day 2:** She observed 50 more customers than Day 1, meaning she counted 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
* **Total for the first two days:** The total number of customers observed in the first two days is 100 + 150 = 250.
* **Day 3:**  The total number of customers observed over the three days is 250 + 250 = 500. 

Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

"The problem presents a scenario with a logical inconsistency.  Let's break down the given information and analyze the implications:

* **Initial State:** The problem states that the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago. This implies a relative change in water levels.
* **Water Loss:**  The problem states that both pools lose 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes. This implies a consistent rate of water loss.
* **Post-Loss State:** The problem states that the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool. This implies a proportional change in water levels.

However, the problem's core contradiction lies in the fact that the initial state of the pools is not consistent with the final state.  The problem states that the big pool has four times the water of the small pool, but this is not possible given the initial state. 

**Therefore, the problem is flawed and does not have a valid solution.**

"To determine the number of hours Lori needs to work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the shoes and belt.  The total cost is $320.00 (shoes) + $32.00 (belt) = $352.00.  

Next, we divide the total cost by Lori's hourly wage to find the number of hours required: $352.00 / $8.00/hour = 44 hours. 


Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to afford the shoes and belt.

"Let's break down the problem. Janeth borrowed $2000 and is required to repay it with an additional 10% of the principal amount.  This means her total repayment is $2000 + (10/100)* $2000 = $2000 + $200 = $2200.  She will pay $165 per month for 12 months, totaling $165 * 12 = $1980.  Therefore, her remaining balance after 12 months will be $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Harriet's age:** We are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.
* **Adrian's age:** Adrian's age is three times Harriet's, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
* **Zack's age:**  Harriet is half Zack's age, meaning Zack is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.
* **Average age in three years:**  To find the average age in three years, we need to consider the ages of all three individuals in three years.  This is a straightforward calculation: (63 + 21 + 42) / 3 = 126 / 3 = 42 years.

Therefore, the average age of the three in three years will be 42 years.

"To determine the probability of a randomly selected card being a water type, we first need to calculate the total number of Pokemon James possesses.  He has 30 fire-type, 20 grass-type, and 40 water-type Pokemon, totaling 90 cards.  

Next, we need to account for the loss of 8 water-type Pokemon and the subsequent purchase of 14 grass-type Pokemon.  This results in 32 water-type Pokemon remaining.

The probability of selecting a water-type card is then calculated as the number of water-type Pokemon divided by the total number of Pokemon: 32/90.

Finally, we can express this probability as a percentage.  Rounding to the nearest integer, the probability is approximately 36%.

"To determine the time required to complete the puzzle, we need to consider the rate at which each individual contributes to the solution. Kalinda's rate is 4 pieces per minute, while her mother's rate is half that, at 2 pieces per minute.  

The combined rate of the two is 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.  

Therefore, to find the total time required to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces (360) by the combined rate (6 pieces per minute). This gives us 360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

Finally, we convert this time from minutes to hours, resulting in 60 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 1 hour.

"To determine the number of tomato vines Steve needs, we first need to consider the rate of tomato production per vine and the daily consumption rate of Steve. 

Since each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, we can calculate the total number of tomatoes needed by considering his daily consumption.  

Steve consumes 6 tomatoes per day.  To find the total weekly consumption, we multiply his daily consumption by the number of days in a week: 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

To determine the number of vines required to produce 42 tomatoes per week, we divide the total tomatoes needed by the tomatoes produced per vine: 42 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 14 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 14 tomato vines.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We are given that there are a certain number of snails in two aquariums.  We are also given that the difference in the number of snails is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'.  We can express the difference in snails as:

*  Snails in the first aquarium: 4
*  Snails in the second aquarium: 32
*  The difference in snails is twice the number of fish: 32 - 4 = 2 * x

This translates to the equation: 32 - 4 = 2x

Solving for x, we get: 28 = 2x, therefore x = 14. 

Therefore, there are **14** fish in each aquarium.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total lines Sean needs to memorize.

* **Scene 1:** The first scene has twice the number of lines in the song, which has 54 lines.  Therefore, the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines.  However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, meaning he has 108 lines * (1/3) = 36 lines.

* **Scene 2:** The second scene has six more lines than the song, which has 54 lines.  This means the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  Furthermore, four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has 60 lines * (4/5) = 48 lines.

* **Total Lines:**  To find the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize, we add the lines from both scenes: 36 lines + 48 lines = 84 lines.


Therefore, Sean needs to memorize a total of 84 lines.

"Let's analyze the given information. We are given two statements about the ages of Ruby and Sam:

* **Statement 1:** Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
* **Statement 2:** In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

We can represent these statements with equations:

*  Let Ruby's current age be represented by 'R'
*  Let Sam's current age be represented by 'S'

From Statement 1, we know: R = 6S

From Statement 2, we know: R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Now, we can substitute the value of R from Statement 1 into Statement 2:

6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Simplifying the equation:

6S + 9 = 3S + 27

Combining like terms:

3S = 18

Solving for S:

S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The cost of the ice cream bars is 4 ice cream bars multiplied by the price per ice cream bar, which is $0.50. This gives us a cost of $2.00.  Finally, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total cost.  Therefore, the total cost is $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00.

"To determine the number of spots on all the snakes, we first need to find the total number of spots on the cobras and mambas.  

* **Cobras:** Each cobra has 70 spots. We know there are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots on cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.
* **Mambas:** Each mamba has 35 spots. We know there are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on mambas is 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.
* **Total Spots:** The total number of spots is 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, to find half the total number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2: 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

"To determine the number of trucks required for this delivery, we need to consider the weight of the flagstones and the capacity of each truck.  

The total weight of the flagstones is 5,000 pounds.  Each truck can carry 2,000 pounds.  

Therefore, we can determine the number of trucks needed by dividing the total weight by the weight capacity of each truck:

5,000 pounds / 2,000 pounds/truck = 2.5 trucks

Since we cannot have half a truck, we round up to the nearest whole number.

"To determine the time taken by the car in the slow lane, we can utilize the fundamental relationship between distance, speed, and time:  

* **Distance = Speed x Time**

We are given:

* Distance = 480 miles
* Speed of the car in the fast lane = 60 miles/hour
* Speed of the car in the slow lane = 30 miles/hour

Let 't' represent the time taken by the car in the slow lane.  Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

480 miles = 30 miles/hour * t

Solving for 't', we obtain:

t = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took **16 hours** to cover the same distance.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars each child receives, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available.  

The total number of chocolate bars is 24 (for the adults) + 40 (for the children) = 64.  

Since each child receives an equal share of the remaining chocolate bars, we can calculate the number of bars per child by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the number of children: 64 / 8 = 8. 

Therefore, each child will receive 8 chocolate bars.

"Let's break down the exercise regimen:

* **Day 1:** Darren performs 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses.
* **Day 2:** He increases his pushups by 20, decreases his squats by 10, and doubles his dumbbell presses.

To calculate the total number of exercises performed over the two days, we need to consider the changes from Day 1 to Day 2.

**Day 2:**

* Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
* Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
* Dumbbell Presses: 20 * 2 = 40

**Total for both days:**

* Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
* Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
* Dumbbell Presses: 20 + 40 = 60

**Total:** 220 + 90 + 60 = **370** 


Therefore, Darren performs a total of 370 exercises over the two days.

First, we need to determine the original price of the milk.  We are given that a packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0.5.  

To calculate the total cost of the milk, we need to know the original price.  

Once we have the original price of the milk, we can calculate the total cost of the milk. 

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the purchase, which includes the cost of the ice cream and the milk. 

To determine the total savings, we can subtract the total cost of the purchase from the original price of the ice cream and the milk.

"To determine the amount Theo spends on gifts, we need to first calculate his total expenses for the trip. 

* **Business Suit Cost:** 6 suits * $100/suit = $600
* **Suitcase Cost:** 3 suitcases * $50/suit = $150
* **Flight Ticket Cost:** 5 * $100 = $500
* **Total Trip Expenses:** $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2350

Subtracting his total trip expenses from his initial budget, we find his remaining funds for gifts:

* **Remaining Funds:** $6000 - $2350 = $3650

Therefore, Theo has $3650 to spend on gifts.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

* **Cera's age six years ago:** We know Cera is currently 46 years old.  Therefore, six years ago, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
* **Noah's age six years ago:**  We are told that six years ago, Noah was half Cera's age.  This means Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old.
* **Population of Chile six years ago:** The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age.  Therefore, the population was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.
* **Current population of Chile:**  Since the population of Chile six years ago was 60,000, the current population is 60,000 + 6 = 60,006.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

Let 'x' represent the number of players on the defense.  We are given that the offense has twice the number of players as the defense, meaning there are 2x players on offense.  Furthermore, the special teams have half the number of players as the defense, so there are x/2 players on special teams.

The total number of players on the team is 105, so we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Combining like terms, we get:

(7/2)x = 105

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (7/2), which is (2/7):

x = 105 * (2/7)

Simplifying:

x = 30

Therefore, there are **30** players on the defense.

* A total of 12 + 12 = 24 individuals are invited.
* 8 individuals are unable to attend due to illness.
*  1/4 of the 8 individuals who couldn't attend had prior commitments, meaning 8 * (1/4) = 2 individuals had prior commitments.
*  Therefore, 24 - 2 = 22 individuals attend the party.

"The cost to fill the pool is determined by calculating the volume of the pool and then multiplying that volume by the cost per cubic foot. 

The volume of the pool is calculated as follows:

* Length x Width x Depth = Volume
* 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet = 120 cubic feet

The cost is then determined by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot, which is $0.10.

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is 120 cubic feet * $0.10/cubic foot = $12.00.

"The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, meaning for every pole, there are 3 wires.  We are given that the total number of wires is 45.  To find the number of poles, we can use the following logic:

* **Understanding the Ratio:** The ratio 1:3 represents a proportional relationship between the number of poles and wires.
* **Finding the Unit Value:**  The total number of wires is 45, and the ratio is 1:3.  To find the value of one unit, we can divide the total number of wires by the ratio: 45 wires / 4 = 11.25.
* **Calculating the Poles:**  Since the ratio is 1:3, for every 1 unit of wire, we need 3 poles.  Therefore, the total number of poles is 11.25 * 3 = 33.75.

**Answer:** 34

"To determine the number of boxes required to store the pencils, we need to consider the total number of pencils and the number of pencils each individual has. 

Jam has 24 pencils, and we know she has 2 boxes.  Meg has 46 pencils.  Therefore, we need to determine the total number of pencils. 

The total number of pencils is 24 (Jam) + 46 (Meg) = 70 pencils. 

To store 70 pencils, we need to determine the number of boxes. 

We can determine the number of boxes needed by dividing the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box. 

Therefore, we need 70 pencils / 12 pencils per box = 5.83 boxes. 

Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that the cooling effect of the ice cubes is 65 degrees, and the coffee weakens by 12 milliliters per degree of cooling.  We need to find the total weakening of the coffee after the cooling and the addition of cream. 

The cooling effect is directly proportional to the temperature change, so we can calculate the total weakening due to cooling alone: 65 degrees * 12 milliliters/degree = 780 milliliters.

The addition of cream further weakens the coffee by 15 milliliters.  

Therefore, the final weakening of the coffee is 780 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 795 milliliters.

"Let's break down the problem and analyze the given information.  We are told that 5 people trade their old records for new ones.  The ratio of old records to new records is 2:1.  This means that for every 2 old records traded, 1 new record is obtained.  We are given that 7 new records were obtained in total.  

To find the number of old records traded, we can use the following equation:

* **Total new records = (Number of people trading) * (Ratio of old to new records)**

We know that 7 new records were obtained and the ratio is 2:1.  Therefore:

* **7 = 5 * (2/1)**

Solving for the number of old records traded, we get:

* **7 = 10**

Therefore, the number of old records traded is **10**.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Junior Programmer Count:** The company employs 100 employees, and junior programmers constitute 2/5 of the total workforce. This translates to 2/5 * 100 = 40 junior programmers.
* **Junior Programmer Salary:** Each junior programmer earns $2000 per month.
* **Senior Programmer Salary:** Senior programmers receive a $400 premium over junior programmers. Therefore, their monthly salary is $2000 + $400 = $2400.
* **Total Junior Programmer Salary:** The total salary for all junior programmers is 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000.
* **Total Senior Programmer Salary:** The total salary for all senior programmers is 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000.
* **Total Programmer Salary:** The total salary for all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.


**Therefore, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all its programmers per month.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know the final destination is the third stop, and there are 20 people traveling there.
* We need to determine the number of passengers who boarded the bus at the terminal.
* The information provided indicates a net change in passengers at each stop. 

**Therefore, we can use the following logic:**

* **At the first stop:**  5 more people boarded.
* **At the second stop:** 7 disembarked and 8 more boarded.

**To find the initial number of passengers at the terminal, we can use the following equation:**

* Total passengers at the third stop = Initial passengers at the terminal + Passengers who boarded at the first stop + Passengers who boarded at the second stop - Passengers who disembarked at the second stop

**Solving for the initial number of passengers at the terminal:**

* 20 = Initial passengers + 5 + 8 - 7
* 20 = Initial passengers + 6
* Initial passengers = 20 - 6
* Initial passengers = 14

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial lollipop count:** Oscar begins with 24 lollipops.

2. **Giving to friends:** He distributes 14 lollipops, leaving him with 24 - 14 = 10 lollipops.

3. **Purchase on the way home:** He buys twice the number he gave away, so he purchases 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.

4. **Total after purchase:**  His total is now 10 + 28 = 38 lollipops.

5. **Additional consumption:** He consumes 3 more lollipops that night, bringing his total to 38 - 3 = 35 lollipops.

6. **Final consumption:** He consumes 2 more lollipops in the morning, resulting in a final count of 35 - 2 = 33 lollipops.


**Therefore, Oscar has 33 lollipops remaining.**

"The cost difference between the two offers can be determined by comparing the total cost of each offer. 

**Furniture United:**

* The initial payment is $1350.
* The monthly installments are $350 each, for a total of 6 installments.
* Total cost for Furniture United: $1350 + ($350 x 6) = $1350 + $2100 = $3450

**Cozy Homes:**

* The initial payment is $1100.
* The monthly installments are $250 each, for a total of 9 installments.
* Total cost for Cozy Homes: $1100 + ($250 x 9) = $1100 + $2250 = $3350

**The difference in cost is:** $3450 (Furniture United) - $3350 (Cozy Homes) = $100.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given a class of 200 students divided into three groups.  The key is to understand the relationship between the groups.  

* **Let's denote the number of students in each of the equal groups as 'x'.**  

* **The size of the smallest group is then 'x - 10'.**

* **The total number of students in the equal groups is 2x.**

* **The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10) = 200**

* **Solving for x, we get:** 
   * 3x - 10 = 200

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We are given the following information:

1.  **Total animals:** c + w = 60 
2.  **Chickens vs. Cows:** c = 2w

**Solving the System:**

From the second equation, we can isolate 'c' to get: c = 2w.  

Substitute this value of 'c' into the first equation: (2w) + w = 60

Combine like terms: 3w = 60

Solve for 'w': w = 60 / 3 = 20

Now, substitute the value of 'w' back into the equation c = 2w to find 'c': c = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculating Total Legs:**

* Chickens have 2 legs each, so there are 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.
* Cows have 4 legs each, so there are 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.

The total number of legs is 80 + 80 = 160.


**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

"To determine the percentage increase in daily earnings, we first calculate the change in earnings. The factory now earns $1100/day from silos compared to $1000/day from tractors. This represents a difference of $100/day. 

To express this as a percentage, we divide the change in earnings by the original earnings and multiply by 100%:

($100/day / $1000/day) * 100% = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the height of the shortest tree.
    * The second tree is 'x + 5' feet tall.
    * The tallest tree is '2(x + (x + 5))' feet tall.

* **Simplify the expression for the tallest tree:**
    * 2(x + (x + 5)) = 2(2x + 5) = 4x + 10

* **Set up an equation:**
    * The tallest tree's height is twice the combined height of the shorter trees: 4x + 10 = 2(x + (x + 5))

* **Solve for x:**
    * 4x + 10 = 2(2x + 5)
    * 4x + 10 = 4x + 10
    * 10 = 10 

* **Determine the height of the tallest tree:**
    * The equation 10 = 10 is a tautology, meaning it's always true. This means there is no contradiction in the problem statement. 

**Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 4x + 10 feet.**

"Let's break down the problem to determine the maximum number of friends Morgan can invite. 

* **Mini-golf:** The cost per person for mini-golf is $5.  
* **Go-karts:** The cost per ride for go-karts is $10.
* **Total Budget:** Morgan has a total budget of $90.

To find the maximum number of friends she can invite, we need to consider the cost of the activities and the total budget. 

**Let's represent the number of friends as 'x'.**

* **Mini-golf cost:** 5x 
* **Go-kart cost:** 10 * 2 = $20 (since she wants to ride the go-karts twice)
* **Total cost:** 5x + 20

**Setting up the equation:**

5x + 20 = 90

**Solving for x:**

1. Subtract 20 from both sides: 5x = 70
2. Divide both sides by 5: x = 14

**Therefore, Morgan can invite 14 friends.**

"To determine the energy savings, we first need to calculate the daily energy consumption of the air conditioner.  The AC uses 900 watts per hour and operates for 8 hours daily, resulting in a daily energy consumption of 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours.

If Mel reduces his usage by 5 hours, his daily energy consumption becomes 900 watts/hour * 3 hours/day = 2700 watt-hours.

The energy saved per day is then calculated as 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours.

To express this in kilowatt-hours, we divide the energy saved in watt-hours by 1000, resulting in 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kWh.

Finally, to find the total energy saved over 30 days, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days: 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh.

"Let's break down Sally's spending.  

First, we need to consider the taffy deal.  The sale states ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""  This translates to a discount of $1.50 for every pound purchased.  

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the taffy.  The price per pound is $3.00, and Sally purchased 2 pounds.  Therefore, the cost of the taffy is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

We also need to consider the cost of the seashells and the magnets.  The seashells cost $1.50, and the magnets cost $0.25 each, for a total of 4 magnets * $0.25/magnet = $1.00.

Finally, we can calculate Sally's remaining funds.  Her total spending is $6.00 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $8.50.  Her starting amount was $10.00, so she has $10.00 - $8.50 = $1.50 remaining.


**Answer:** $1.50

"Let's break down the cost analysis.  

* **Cost of the second pack:** The second pack costs twice the price of the first pack, so it costs $400 * 2 = $800.
* **Total cost before discount:** The total cost of the fireworks before the discount is $400 + $800 = $1200.
* **Discount amount:** The discount is 20% of $1200, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.
* **Final cost after discount:** After the discount, Tim spends $1200 - $240 = $960.
* **Total cost including finale:** The total cost including the finale firework is $960 + $150 = $1110.

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $1110.

"The question presents a scenario where we need to determine the number of candles that meet two specific criteria: being defective and exploding. 

We are given that 5% of the candles are defective and have a wet dog smell.  We are also given that 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.  

To solve this, we need to consider the intersection of these two events.  

**The key is to recognize that the two events are not mutually exclusive.**  A candle that is defective and explodes is a candle that meets both criteria. 

Therefore, the number of candles that meet both criteria is equal to the number of defective candles.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Joanne's apples from shortest trees:**  We know Joanne gathers half the apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Joanne's apples from average trees:**  We need to find the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.  Let's denote this as 'x'.
* **Sister's apples from shortest trees:** Her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 15 * 3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Sister's apples from tallest trees:**  Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne, so she gathers 30 * 2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.
* **Total apples from shortest trees:**  Joanne's sister gathers 45 apples from the shortest trees.
* **Total apples from average trees:**  The sisters have a combined total of 500 apples, and Joanne has 30 + 15 + x = 45 + x apples. 
* **Solve for x:** 45 + x + 60 = 500
* **Solve for x:** x = 500 - 45 - 60 = 405

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries. We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:**  c + d = 180 (The total number of heads is 180)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + d = 304 (The total number of bumps is 304)

We can solve for 'c' in Equation 1:
* c = 180 - d

Now, substitute this value of 'c' into Equation 2:
* 2(180 - d) + d = 304

Simplify and solve for 'd':
* 360 - 2d + d = 304
* 360 - d = 304
* -d = -56
* d = 56

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.  We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and we know Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.  Therefore, we can find the size of Zack's locker by using the following equation:

* Peter's locker = (1/4) * Zack's locker

We can then use this information to find the size of Zack's locker. 

* Peter's locker = 5 cubic inches
* (1/4) * Zack's locker = 5 cubic inches
* Zack's locker = 5 cubic inches * 4 
* Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Finally, we can find the size of Timothy's locker. We know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. 

* Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches
* Timothy's locker = 20 cubic inches * 2
* Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches


 
**Answer:** Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

"Let's break down the cost of Bill's streaming service subscription. 

* **Introductory Period:** The first 6 months cost $8/month for a total of $8 * 6 = $48.
* **Transitional Period:** The price then increased to $12/month for the next 2 months, totaling $12 * 2 = $24.
* **Standard Rate:** The price then increased to $14/month for the next 6 months, totaling $14 * 6 = $84.
* **Total Cost:**  The total cost for 8 months is $48 + $24 + $84 = $156.

To calculate the cost for 2 years (24 months), we simply multiply the cost per month by the number of months: $156 * 2 = $312. 


**Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $312.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Cost of jogger jeans:** The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.
* **Total cost:** Cole spent a total of $28 (tattered jeans) + $22 (jogger jeans) = $50 on the jeans.
* **Savings:** Cole saved $6 in total.
* **Savings from jogger jeans:**  He saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, which is $6 * (1/3) = $2.
* **Savings from tattered jeans:**  He saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.
* **Original price of jogger jeans:**  We know he saved $4 from the tattered jeans, and the total savings was $6.  Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans was $6 / (1/3) = $18.
* **Difference in price:** The original price of the jogger jeans was $18, and the price of the tattered jeans was $28. The difference is $28 - $18 = $10.

"Let's break down the problem to find the solution.  

We know Kenny needs to earn $100 to purchase the amusement park ticket. He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.50 each.  We need to determine the initial number of cards he possesses.

Let 'x' represent the number of cards Kenny has.  We can set up the following equation:

1.5x = $100

To find the value of 'x', we can solve for it:

x = $100 / 1.5 
x = 66.67

Since we need a whole number of cards, we round this value to the nearest whole number.  Therefore, Kenny started with approximately 67 cards.

"The problem presents a classic scenario of a supply-demand mismatch.  We need to determine the number of guests who did not receive a second hot dog. 

Here's how to approach the problem:

* **Initial Setup:** The caterer was instructed to prepare enough hot dogs for 36 guests, assuming a standard consumption pattern of one hot dog per guest.
* **Modified Consumption:**  The caterer prepared enough for half the guests to have two hot dogs, implying a modified consumption pattern.
* **Actual Guests:** 40 guests arrived, exceeding the initial expectation.
* **The Key Insight:**  The caterer prepared enough hot dogs to satisfy the modified consumption pattern of half the guests. 

Therefore, the number of guests who did not receive a second hot dog is the difference between the total number of guests and the number of guests who received a second hot dog.

"Let's break down the cost calculation.  

First, we need to determine the total cost of the initial purchase: $120.00 (pots and pans) + $20.00 (bowls) + $25.00 (utensils) = $165.00.

Next, we apply the 20% discount: $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00.  

Finally, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00. 


Therefore, the final price of Charlotte's order is $132.00.

* 15 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 120 pints

Next, we need to determine the fraction of the total gallons Josey used.  

* Josey used 1/4 of a container, which is equivalent to 1/4 * 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons.

Finally, we can calculate the amount of gasoline Josey used in pints:

* 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.


**Answer:** 6 pints

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that George spent $5.00 and has 1% of his money remaining.  This means he spent $4.95 on candy bars.  We can then use this information to determine the number of candy bars he purchased. 

**Here's how to solve:**

* **Cost of chips:**  The cost of the chips is $1.20 (3 bags * $0.40/bag).
* **Remaining funds:** George has $5.00 - $0.05 (1% of $5.00) = $4.95 remaining.
* **Candy bar cost:**  We know George spent $4.95 on candy bars, and each candy bar costs $0.75.
* **Candy bar quantity:**  $4.95 / $0.75 = 6.6.  Since we can't buy fractions of candy bars, we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Therefore, George bought 6 candy bars.**

"Let's analyze the cost of Antoine's French onion soup.  

First, we need to determine the total cost of the onions.  He needs 4 pounds of onions, and they are priced at $2.00 per pound.  Therefore, the total cost of the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

Next, we need to determine the cost of the beef stock. He requires 2 boxes of beef stock, each priced at $2.00.  The total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the soup. The total cost is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

To determine the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings.  The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00/serving.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to travel to the theater.  Bernadette's travel time is four times longer, meaning it takes her 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.  To determine Bernadette's arrival time relative to Wayne, we need to consider the time difference.  Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.  Therefore, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne.

"The area of the room is given as 360 square feet.  We know the length is 3 yards, which is equivalent to 9 feet.  We can use the area formula to find the width: 360 = 9 * width.  Solving for width, we get width = 40 feet.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 * (length + width).  Therefore, the perimeter is 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.

"To determine the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, we need to consider the number of beads each sister possesses. 

Elizabeth possesses 3 packs of beads, totaling 3 * 20 = 60 beads. 

Margareth possesses 7 packs of beads, totaling 7 * 20 = 140 beads.

The difference in the number of beads is 140 - 60 = 80. 

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Jon's Time:** We know Jon completes the swim in 40 minutes, the bike in 70 minutes, and the run in 50 minutes.  His total time is 40 + 70 + 50 = 160 minutes.
* **James's Swim:**  James is 10% faster than Jon, meaning his swim time is 40 * 1.10 = 44 minutes.
* **James's Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 70 + 5 = 75 minutes.
* **James's Total Time:**  We need to find James's total time.  We know his swim is 44 minutes and his bike is 75 minutes.  We can calculate his run time by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time. 
* **James's Run:**  We know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James's run time is 119 - 10 = 109 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

First, we need to convert the time Michael's horse runs to hours.  Since 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours, we have a total running time of 0.5 hours.

Next, we need to determine the distance the horse travels. We know the horse runs at 32 miles per hour and has been running for 0.5 hours.  Therefore, the distance is calculated as:

Distance = Speed * Time = 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Now, we can calculate the amount of hay Michael's horse consumes.  The horse consumes 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, so the total hay consumed is:

Hay consumed = Distance * Hay per mile = 16 miles * (1/2) bail = 8 bales.

Finally, we need to determine the total cost of the hay.  Each bail of hay costs $3.  Therefore, the total cost is:

Total cost = Hay consumed * Cost per bail = 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

To find Michael's change, we need to subtract the total cost from the amount of money he has.  He has $6.00 and the total cost of the hay is $24.00.  Therefore, his change is:

Change = Money - Cost = $6.00 - $24.00 = -$18.00.

"The salesman's profit is calculated as follows:

1. **Initial Revenue:** The salesman initially purchased 48 sneakers for $576.
2. **Flash Sale Revenue:** He sold 17 sneakers at $20 each, generating $340 in revenue.
3. **Remaining Inventory:**  The remaining inventory consists of 31 sneakers.
4. **Department Store Revenue:** The remaining sneakers were sold at $25 each, generating $775 in revenue.
5. **Total Revenue:** The total revenue from all sales is $340 + $775 = $1115.
6. **Profit:** The profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and the initial cost: $1115 - $576 = $539.

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given two options for purchasing a movie experience:

* **Option 1:** A ""Super Ticket"" for $20, which grants access to any movie and includes a popcorn and soda combo for an additional $1.
* **Option 2:** A regular movie ticket for $12, with a separate purchase of a popcorn and soda at regular price.

We are also told that the individual purchased the regular ticket and combo, resulting in a savings of $2.  

To determine the regular price of the popcorn, we can use the following logic:

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket and Combo:** The Super Ticket costs $20, and the combo costs $1 extra, making the total cost $21.
2. **Cost of the Regular Ticket and Combo:** The individual saved $2, implying the regular ticket and combo cost $21 - $2 = $19.
3. **Cost of the Popcorn and Soda Combo:** The regular ticket and combo cost $19, and the soda costs $3, so the popcorn and soda combo cost $19 - $3 = $16.
4. **Cost of Popcorn:** The popcorn and soda combo cost $16, and the soda costs $3, so the popcorn costs $16 - $3 = $13.

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is **$13**.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900.  We are also told that the price per balloon was increased by $20.  We need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons after this price increase.

First, we need to determine the original price per balloon.  We know the total cost of 20 balloons was $900.  Therefore, the original price per balloon is $900 / 20 = $45.

Next, we need to calculate the new price per balloon.  The price per balloon increased by $20, so the new price is $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, we can calculate the cost of filling 170 balloons at the new price.  The cost is 170 * $65 = $11050.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Sapphire Value:** Jenna begins with 8 sapphires, each worth $800.  
* **Ruby Value:** She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.  The value of rubies is $1200 per ruby.
* **Total Value:** To find the total value, we need to consider the value of the sapphires and rubies.

Therefore, the total value of Jenna's jewels is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies.

"To determine the total number of apples consumed by Marin and Nancy in 30 days, we can simply multiply their daily consumption by the number of days.  

Marin and Nancy consume 4 apples each per day, so their combined consumption is 4 apples/person * 2 people = 8 apples per day.

Over 30 days, their total consumption is 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

"The cost of potting soil for Bob's raised beds can be determined by first calculating the total volume of soil required.  Each bed requires 32 cubic feet of soil, and he has 10 beds, so the total volume needed is 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet.  

To determine the number of bags needed, we divide the total volume by the volume per bag: 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.  

Finally, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of bags by the price per bag: 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Green Cards:** The problem states there are 60% more green cards than red cards.  This translates to an increase of 0.60 * 15 = 9 green cards.
* **Total Red and Green:** The total number of red and green cards is 15 + 9 = 24.
* **Yellow Cards:** The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards, so there are also 24 yellow cards.
* **Total Cards:** The total number of cards is 15 + 9 + 24 = 48.


**Answer:** 48

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count:** Katelyn observes 50 fairies.
2. **Arrival:** One friend observes 25 fairies arriving from the east, increasing the total to 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
3. **Departure:**  30 fairies subsequently depart, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

Therefore, there are **45** fairies remaining.

"To determine the percentage of puppies with spots, we first need to find the total number of spotted puppies across both dogs.  Jennifer has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon has 4.  This totals 7 spotted puppies.  

Next, we need to consider the total number of puppies across both dogs, which is 8 + 12 = 20.

Finally, we can calculate the percentage of spotted puppies by dividing the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and then multiplying by 100%:

(7 / 20) * 100% = 35% 


Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

"To determine the difference in cost between Becky and Kelly's purchases, we need to consider the price per apple and the applied discounts. 

**Becky's purchase:**

* Cost per apple: $0.45
* Total cost: 20 apples * $0.45/apple = $9.00
* Discount: $1.00
* Final cost: $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

**Kelly's purchase:**

* Cost per apple: $0.50
* Total cost: 20 apples * $0.50/apple = $10.00
* Discount: 0.10 * $10.00 = $1.00

"Let's break down this problem.  We are given that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, and his dad has stipulated a rule: the number of cookies he can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room.  

To find the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we can set up an equation. Let 'x' represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.  

The equation is: 0.5x + 2 = 5

Solving for 'x', we get:

1. Subtract 2 from both sides: 0.5x = 3
2. Divide both sides by 0.5: x = 6

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks.

"The remoras, being ectoparasites, are a part of the shark's body, and thus, their length is a proportion of the shark's total length.  To express this proportion as a percentage, we can calculate the ratio of the remora length to the shark's total length. 

The shark's total length is 120 inches, and the remora's length is 72 inches.  Therefore, the remora's length is 72/120 = 0.6.  Multiplying this by 100% gives us 60%.

"Let's break down this problem using a simple algebraic approach.

We are given that 3/4 of the students at a certain grade level have a desktop computer at home.  This means that 1/4 of the students do not have a desktop computer.  We are also given that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

We can represent this information with the following equation:

(3/4)x - 20 = (1/4)x

To solve for x, the total number of students, we can follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the equation:** Multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get rid of the fractions: 3x - 80 = x
2. **Isolate x:** Subtract x from both sides: 2x - 80 = 0
3. **Solve for x:** Add 80 to both sides: 2x = 80
4. **Find x:** Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

Therefore, there are **40** students at that grade level.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given that the 2010 penny weighs three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny.  We are also given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.  

To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we can use the given information:

*  Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * Weight of 1959 penny

Substituting the given weight of the 1959 penny:

* Weight of 2010 penny = (3/4) * 48 grains = 36 grains

Finally, to find the combined weight, we simply add the weights of both pennies:

* Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny
* Combined weight = 48 grains + 36 grains = 84 grains


Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.

"The problem presents a classic application of geometric series and the concept of height summation.  

Let's break it down:

1. **Height of the base:** The base of the pyramid is formed by 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall.  The total height of the base is 4 * 64 inches = 256 inches.

2. **Height of the subsequent layers:** The pyramid's height increases with each subsequent layer.  The second layer has 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, resulting in a total height of 3 * 64 inches = 192 inches.  The third layer has 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, resulting in a total height of 2 * 64 inches = 128 inches.

3. **Total height:**  The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of all the layers.  Therefore, the total height is 256 inches + 192 inches + 128 inches = 576 inches.

4. **Conversion to feet:**  To convert the total height to feet, divide the total height in inches by 12 inches per foot.  This gives us 576 inches / 12 inches/foot = 48 feet.

"Let's break down the problem to find the number of insects Lily collected. 

Let 'x' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.  David found half of Bodhi's insects, meaning he found x/2.  Lily found 7 more than David, so she found (x/2) + 7.

The total number of insects is the sum of their individual collections: x + (x/2) + (x/2) + 7 = 43.

Combining like terms, we get: 5x/2 + 7 = 43.  Subtracting 7 from both sides, we have: 5x/2 = 36.  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 5x = 72.  Finally, dividing both sides by 5, we find x = 14.4.

To find Lily's insects, we substitute the value of x back into the expression (x/2) + 7: (14.4/2) + 7 = 7.2 + 7 = 14.2.

Therefore, Lily found 14.2 insects.

"The problem presents a classic optimization scenario.  We need to determine the optimal combination of wood types to minimize the cost of popsicle sticks while maximizing the total number produced. 

Let's analyze the cost per stick for each wood type:

* **2x4:** $4 / 200 sticks = $0.02 per stick
* **2x8:** $6 / 400 sticks = $0.015 per stick

The 2x4 wood offers a lower cost per stick, making it the more economical choice for maximizing the number of sticks produced. 

To determine the maximum number of sticks Frederick can make, we need to determine the maximum number of 2x4 pieces he can purchase with his $24 budget.  

* $24 / $4 per piece = 6 pieces

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose purchased 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  This information is crucial to determine Sophia's purchases.  

The key is understanding that Rose's purchases are 4 times the quantity Sophia bought.  Therefore, we can set up a proportion to solve for Sophia's purchases.

Let 'x' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.  We know Rose bought 4 times the number of onions Sophia bought, so we can write the following equation:

4x = 12

Solving for x, we find:

x = 12 / 4 = 3

This means Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, we can use the same logic to find the number of potatoes Sophia bought.  We know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions, so Sophia bought 4 - 3 = 1 potato.

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 onions and potatoes in total.

"Let's break down this problem.  We are given that Jeff receives 4 times the amount Brad receives.  This can be represented as an equation:

*  Let 'x' represent the amount Brad receives.
*  Jeff receives 4x.
*  The total amount is 100 dollars, so x + 4x = 100.
*  Combining like terms, we get 5x = 100.
*  Solving for x, we divide both sides by 5 to find x = 20.
*  Therefore, Jeff receives 4x, which is 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.


**Answer:** 80

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial Writing:** Elise writes the alphabet twice, resulting in 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.
* **Single Writing:** She writes half the alphabet once, which is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
* **Re-writing:**  This means she's essentially writing the alphabet again, so the total number of letters written is the sum of the previous two steps.

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 52 + 13 = 65. 


**Answer:** 65

"This problem can be solved using the concept of a recursive sequence.  Let's consider the number of families notified at each round:

* **Round 1:** 3 families
* **Round 2:** 3 * 3 = 9 families
* **Round 3:** 9 * 3 = 27 families
* **Round 4:** 27 * 3 = 81 families

Notice that the number of families notified in each round is a geometric sequence where the first term is 3 and the common ratio is 3.  The general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a * r^(n-1), where 'a' is the first term and 'r' is the common ratio.  

Therefore, the number of families notified in the nth round is 3 * 3^(n-1).  

The question asks for the number of families notified in the fourth round, which is 3 * 3^(4-1) = 3 * 3^3 = 3 * 27 = 81.

"Mark's weight loss is a straightforward linear process.  He lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, resulting in a total weight loss of 30 pounds.  To find his initial weight, we can use the following equation:

Initial weight = Final weight + Weight loss

Substituting the given values:

Initial weight = 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Jonathan needs to have a play set five times larger than James's set, which has 80 toys.  This means the desired size of Jonathan's set is 5 * 80 = 400 toys.  

To achieve this, Jonathan needs to have 2 more toys than he currently has.  We can express this mathematically as:

*  x + 2 = 400 - 2

Solving for x, we get:

* x + 2 = 398
* x = 398 - 2
* x = 396

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 396 toys.

"Let's break down the cost calculation.  

* **Notebooks:** 5 notebooks at $1.50 each cost 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
* **Pens:** 2 pens at $0.25 each cost 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
* **Calculator:** 1 calculator at $12.00 costs $12.00
* **Geometry Set:** 1 set at $10.00 costs $10.00

**Total cost before discount:** $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $20.00

**Discount:** The shop offers a 10% discount, so the discount amount is 0.10 * $20.00 = $2.00

**Final cost:** The final cost is the original price minus the discount: $20.00 - $2.00 = $18.00


Therefore, Daniel has to spend $18.00 on all the items. 
"
"Let's break down the cost calculation.  Carly's total expenditure is the sum of the cost of the hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks. 

* **Hamburgers:** 5 hamburgers * $4/hamburger = $20.00
* **Potato Fries:** 10 packs * $0.30/pack = $3.00
* **Fruit Drinks:** 5 cans * $2/can = $10.00

Adding these costs, we get a total expenditure of $20.00 + $3.00 + $10.00 = $33.00.

To determine the change Carly receives, we subtract the total expenditure from the amount she paid: $50.00 - $33.00 = $17.00. 


Therefore, Carly receives $17.00 in change.

"Let's break down Antonella's commission earnings.  

First, we need to determine the commission on the goods sold below $1000.  Since she sold $1000 worth of goods, her commission on this portion is 30% of $1000, which equals $300.

Next, we need to calculate the commission on the goods sold above $1000.  She sold an additional $1500 worth of goods, and her commission on this amount is 10% of $1500, which equals $150.

Finally, to find Antonella's total commission, we add the commissions from both portions: $300 + $150 = $450. 


Therefore, Antonella earned $450 in commission.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given two scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes in cold water.
* **Scenario 2:** Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice the time it takes him in cold water.

We can represent this mathematically:

* Let 'x' be the time Ray takes to swim a mile in cold water.
* In warm water, the time is 2x + 2 minutes.

We are asked to find the difference in time Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day. 

**Key Insight:** The key to solving this problem is to understand that the time taken to swim a mile is directly proportional to the distance.  

**Solution:**

* **Scenario 1:** Time to swim 3 miles = 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes
* **Scenario 2:** Time to swim 3 miles = 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes

**Difference:** 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes

"Let's break down this problem using a simple algebraic approach.  

We know that in 7 years, Shiloh will be 51 years old.  This is represented by the expression: 
*  Shiloh's age in 7 years = 51

We are also given that in 7 years, Shiloh's nephew will be three times his age. This can be represented as:
* Nephew's age in 7 years = 3 * (Shiloh's age in 7 years)

Now, we can substitute the value of Shiloh's age in 7 years into the second equation:
* Nephew's age in 7 years = 3 * 51

Finally, we can solve for the nephew's age in 7 years:
* Nephew's age in 7 years = 153

To find the nephew's age today, we need to subtract 7 from his age in 7 years:

"To determine the roses Ford lacks, we need to consider the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops and then calculate the difference between that and the total roses Ford can supply. 

The flower shops order a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.  

Ford can supply 40 roses per week.  

Therefore, Ford lacks 65 roses - 40 roses = 25 roses per week. 

To find the total roses Ford lacks over a month, we multiply the weekly shortage by the number of weeks in a month. 

A month has 4 weeks, so Ford lacks 25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses.

"The food truck's net profit can be determined by considering the cost of goods sold and revenue generated. 

**Cost of Goods Sold:**

* **Bread:** The cost per loaf is $3.00, and each loaf yields 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.
* **Cheese and Condiments:** The cost per sandwich for cheese and condiments is $30.00 / 10 sandwiches = $3.00.

**Revenue:**

* The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00.
* The total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

**Net Profit:**

* The total cost of goods sold is $0.30 * 10 = $3.00.
* The net profit is the revenue minus the cost of goods sold: $70.00 - $3.00 = $67.00.


Therefore, the food truck's net profit is **$67.00**.

"To determine the total cost of Michael's carpet replacement, we need to consider the cost of the carpet itself, the padding, removal, and installation. 

First, we calculate the cost of the carpet:

* Area of the bedroom: 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet
* Carpet cost: 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592

Next, we calculate the cost of the padding:

* Padding cost: 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432

Then, we calculate the cost of carpet removal:

* Removal cost: 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864

Finally, we calculate the cost of carpet installation:

* Installation cost: 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7456

"The oven is malfunctioning, and the discrepancy between the set temperature and the actual temperature is a constant percentage.  To determine the correct temperature for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to account for this discrepancy. 

Let's consider the following:

* **Percentage Difference:** The oven is 18 degrees hotter than the set temperature.
* **Target Temperature:** The recipe calls for 520 degrees.

To find the correct temperature, we can use the following formula:

**Corrected Temperature = (Target Temperature) + (Percentage Difference * (Target Temperature / Actual Temperature))**

Plugging in the values:

Corrected Temperature = 520 degrees + (18 degrees * (520 degrees / 450 degrees))

**Answer:** 520 degrees + (18 degrees * (520 degrees / 450 degrees)) = **588.8 degrees**

"Let's break down this problem using a strategic approach.  

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as 'b'.  The problem states that the number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as 0.99b.  Similarly, the number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be represented as 1.01b.

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of these three types:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

Solving for 'b', we find: b = 1500

Now, to determine the difference in green and red jelly beans, we can use the following:

Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"Let's analyze the given statement.  We are told that Jerry's current age is represented by the variable 'x'.  The statement states that Jerry is twice as old as he was five years ago.  This translates to the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Solving for 'x', we get:

x - 2x = -10
-x = -10
x = 10

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10 years.  To find his age in three years, we simply add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

**Answer: 13**

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work, we first calculate the total cost of the dental work: 

* The base cost of each implant is $2000.
* A porcelain crown adds an additional $500 to the cost.
* Therefore, the total cost of the two implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000.
*  He has already paid a deposit of $600, leaving a balance of $4000 - $600 = $3400.

To find the number of hours George needs to work, we divide the remaining balance by his hourly wage:

* His hourly wage is $15.
* Therefore, he needs to work $3400 / $15 per hour = 226.67 hours. 


**Answer:** George needs to work approximately 226.67 hours.

"Let's analyze the given information.  We know that the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  We are given that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another is three times the smallest angle.  Let's represent the smallest angle with the variable 'x'.

The other two angles can then be expressed as 2x and 3x respectively.  

Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x, we find:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is 3 * 30 = 90 degrees.


**Answer:** 90 degrees

"To determine the number of years before tire replacement, we need to consider the relationship between tire rotations and mileage.  

First, we need to determine the number of rotations per mile driven.  We are given that the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven.

Next, we need to calculate the total rotations for the given mileage.  Jeremy drives 400 miles, and each rotation is 725 times.  Therefore, the total rotations for 400 miles is:

400 miles * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations

Now, we need to consider the total rotations per year.  We are given that the tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations in a year.

Finally, we can calculate the number of years to replace the tires.  We divide the total rotations per year by the total rotations per mile driven.

Therefore, the number of years to replace the tires is:

125,280,000 rotations / 290,000 rotations/mile = 43.7 years.

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second, which is equivalent to 20,000 bits per second. To express this in megabits per hour, we need to convert bits per second to megabits per hour. 

There are 1,000,000 bits in 1 megabit. Therefore, her internet connection speed is 20,000 bits/second * 1,000,000 bits/megabit = 20,000,000 bits/second.

To convert bits per second to megabits per hour, we need to multiply by 60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour. This gives us 20,000,000 bits/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 7,200,000,000 bits/hour.

Finally, we need to convert bits per hour to megabits per hour. This gives us 7,200,000,000 bits/hour / 1,000,000 bits/megabit = **7.2 megabits per hour**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Wave Height:** The problem states that a wave must be over 30 feet tall for a surfer to be able to stay upright.
* **Percentage of Riders Upright:**  We are given that 25% of surfers who ride waves over 30 feet can stay upright.
* **Gender Breakdown:**  Of the surfers who can stay upright, 60% are women.

To find the number of men who can stay upright, we need to consider the following:

* **Total Upright Riders:** 25 riders
* **Percentage of Men:** 100% - 60% = 40% of the upright riders are men.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright is: 25 riders * 40% = 10 men.


**Answer:** 10 men.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Gold Jewell:** The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 the price of a diamond Jewell.  We know the diamond Jewell costs $2000. Therefore, the gold Jewell costs (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.
* **Silver Jewell:** The silver Jewell costs $400 less than the gold Jewell.  So, the silver Jewell costs $1600 - $400 = $1200.
* **Total Price:** To find the total price, we add the prices of all three jewels: $2000 (diamond) + $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver) = $4800.

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

"Let's break down the problem.  Julie's efficiency is directly proportional to her speed, and we are given that she operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel.  

To find the total weekly production, we need to consider the individual daily production rates and then multiply by the number of days in a week. 

* Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
* Julie processes 50 customers * 2 = 100 customers per day.
* Weekly production for Jewel: 50 customers/day * 7 days/week = 350 customers
* Weekly production for Julie: 100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers
* Total weekly production: 350 customers + 700 customers = 1050 customers

Therefore, the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Paisley ran 4 miles, and Reggie ran 5 times that distance plus 3 miles further than Lynn.  

To find Lynn's distance, we need to isolate her distance.  Let's represent Lynn's distance with the variable 'L'.  We can set up an equation:

* Reggie's distance = 5 * Paisley's distance + 3 miles
* Reggie's distance = 5 * 4 + 3 miles
* Reggie's distance = 20 + 3 miles
* Reggie's distance = 23 miles

We know that Reggie ran 23 miles, and we also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.  Therefore, Lynn ran L miles.  

We can now solve for L:

* Reggie's distance = Lynn's distance + 3 miles
* 23 = L + 3 miles
* L = 23 - 3 miles
* L = 20 miles

Therefore, Lynn ran 20 miles. 


**Answer:** Lynn ran 20 miles.

"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we can break down the problem into individual unit costs.  

* The cost of a single apple is $1.30, as determined by the given information that four apples cost $5.20.
* Similarly, the cost of a single orange is $1.10, calculated from the given information that three oranges cost $3.30.

Therefore, the cost of 5 apples is $1.30 * 5 = $6.50.  

Similarly, the cost of 5 oranges is $1.10 * 5 = $5.50.

Finally, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

"To determine the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley, we need to consider the distance traveled by each individual and then sum their respective distances. 

* **Alisa's distance:**  We know Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours.  Therefore, her total distance is calculated as: 
   Distance = Speed x Time = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours = 54 miles.

* **Stanley's distance:**  Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours.  His total distance is:
   Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours = 25 miles.

* **Total distance:**  To find the total distance, we simply add the distances traveled by both individuals:
   Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance = 54 miles + 25 miles = 79 miles.


Therefore, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles.

"Let's break down the problem. Bill's digging speed is a key factor in determining the total time required.  

* **Soil Digging:** Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
* **Clay Digging:** His speed through clay is half that, at 2 feet per hour.

To find the total time, we need to consider the time spent on each material.

* **Soil Digging Time:**  The total distance of 24 feet of soil divided by Bill's digging speed in soil gives us the time required: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours.
* **Clay Digging Time:** Similarly, the 8 feet of clay requires: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

Finally, to find the total time, we add the time spent on each material: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

* **Growth:** Three weeks later, the number of likes increased by a factor of 70, meaning the total likes were 70 times the initial number. This can be represented as: 2000 * 70 = 14000 likes.
* **Recent increase:**  Fishio received an additional 20000 likes recently.
* **Total likes:** To find the total number of likes, we need to add the initial likes, the likes after three weeks, and the recent increase: 2000 + 14000 + 20000 = 34000 likes.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Red Hat Sales:**  We know Ariadne sold $400 worth of red hats.
* **Green Hat Sales:** Her green hat sales were half the amount of red hats, so she earned $400 / 2 = $200 from green hats.
* **Total Sales (Month 1):**  The total sales for the first month were the sum of red and green hat sales: $400 + $200 = $600.
* **Month 2 Sales:**  Her sales in the second month were 3/4 of the first month's sales: (3/4) * $600 = $450.
* **Total Sales (Two Months):**  To find the total sales over two months, we add the sales from both months: $600 + $450 = $1050.


Therefore, Ariadne made a total of $1050 in two months.

"We can solve this problem using a system of equations. Let's denote the number of sheep as 's' and the number of geese as 'g'.  

We are given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2g = 70 (The total number of legs)
* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20 (The total number of heads)

To solve for 's', we can use elimination.  Let's solve Equation 2 for 's':
* s = 20 - g

Now, substitute this value of 's' into Equation 1:
* 4(20 - g) + 2g = 70

Simplify and solve for 'g':
* 80 - 4g + 2g = 70
* -2g = -10
* g = 5

Now that we know 'g' (the number of geese), we can substitute it back into either Equation 1 or 2 to solve for 's'. Let's use Equation 2:
* s + 5 = 20
* s = 15

Therefore, there are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"To determine the total savings after ten years, we need to consider the monthly savings of both Rong and Neil.  

Rong saves 20 coins per month, while Neil saves 2/5 times more, which is 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins.  Therefore, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong's savings accumulate to 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.  Neil's savings over the same period are calculated as 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

The total savings after ten years is the sum of Rong's and Neil's savings: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Vaccines:** John needs 2 vaccines at $20 each, totaling $20 * 2 = $40.
* **Heartworm Check:** The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, meaning the cost is 0.60 * total cost.
* **Total Cost:**  We know the total cost is $40 + 0.60 * total cost.  We can represent the total cost as 'x'.  This gives us the equation: x = $40 + 0.60x.
* **Solving for x:**  Subtract 0.60x from both sides: 0.40x = $40.  Divide both sides by 0.40: x = $100.
* **Final Amount:** John leaves with $100.

"The price of the crate of fruit can be determined by considering the individual prices of each fruit type. 

* **Bananas:**  Each banana costs $1.00.
* **Apples:** Each apple costs $0.50.
* **Oranges:** Each orange costs $3.00.

To calculate the total cost, we sum the cost of each fruit type:

* **Bananas:** 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* **Oranges:** 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Therefore, the total cost of the crate is $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Gissela's truck can carry 4000 pounds, Gordy's truck can carry 800 more than Gissela's, and together they can haul 11600 pounds.  To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we can use the following steps:

1. **Gordy's capacity:** Gordy's truck can carry 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds.
2. **Combined capacity:** The combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy is 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.
3. **Gary's capacity:**  The total capacity of the three trucks is 11600 pounds, so Gary's truck carries 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.


Therefore, Gary's truck can carry **2800** pounds.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Define the variables:**
    *  Let 'm' represent the number of dumplings Larry cooked for males.
    *  Let 'f' represent the number of dumplings Larry cooked for females.

* **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
    *  We know that m + f = total dumplings.
    *  Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so we can express the number of dumplings each male ate as m = f + 1.

* **Solve for the number of dumplings:**
    *  We know that each female ate 3 dumplings, so f = 3.
    *  Substituting f = 3 into the equation m = f + 1, we get m = 3 + 1 = 4.
    *  Therefore, Larry cooked 4 dumplings for males.
    *  We know that each female ate 3 dumplings, so f = 3.
    *  Substituting f = 3 into the equation m = f + 1, we get m = 3 + 1 = 4.
    *  Therefore, Larry cooked 4 dumplings for males.

"To determine Gerald's remaining balance, we need to first understand the relationship between the ratio and the total amount of money.  The ratio 3:2 represents a division of the $100 into three parts for Gerald and two parts for Julia.  

To find Gerald's portion, we can calculate the value of one part of the ratio: $100 / (3+2) = $20.  

Since Gerald has 3 parts, his initial amount is 3 * $20 = $60.  

Finally, we can calculate his remaining balance by subtracting his spending: $60 - $10 = $50.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.  We are then asked to find the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes. 

First, we need to determine the proportion of the water used for industrial purposes.  We are given that 80% of the water used for industrial purposes is used for this purpose. 

To find the proportion of the water used for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract the proportion used for industrial purposes from 100%. 

Therefore, the percentage of the water used for non-industrial purposes is 100% - 40% = 60%. 

Finally, we need to determine the proportion of the water used for industrial purposes that is used for non-industrial purposes.  We are given that 80% of the water used for industrial purposes is used for this purpose. 

Therefore, the percentage of the water used for non-industrial purposes is 60% * 80% = 48%.

"To determine the total quarts of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we need to consider the production rates of both chocolate and vanilla ice cream. 

First, we can calculate the production rate of chocolate ice cream per hour: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts/hour.

Similarly, the production rate of vanilla ice cream is 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour.

Finally, to find the total production in 48 hours, we multiply the production rate of each flavor by the total time:

* Chocolate ice cream: 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts
* Vanilla ice cream: 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 500 quarts

Adding these two quantities gives us the total production: 2400 quarts + 500 quarts = 2900 quarts. 


Therefore, the factory would produce a total of **2900** quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

"Let's break down the cost calculation.  

First, we need to determine the cost of each item:

* Croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00/croissant = $15.00
* Cinnamon Rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50/cinnamon roll = $10.00
* Mini Quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00/mini quiche = $12.00
* Blueberry Muffins: 13 muffins * $1.00/muffin = $13.00

Adding these up, we get the total cost before any discounts: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $40.00

Now, we apply the 10% discount: $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00

Finally, we subtract the discount from the original cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00


Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $36.00.

Ginger consumes 4 pieces per day, and over two weeks, she consumes 4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces. Amy, on the other hand, consumes 3 pieces per day, resulting in 3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces.

The difference in candy between Amy and Ginger is 42 pieces - 56 pieces = -14 pieces.  This indicates that Amy has 14 fewer pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

"Let's break down the cost analysis.  

First, we need to determine the total cost incurred by James for his blueberry picking venture.  This involves considering the initial cost of the trip, which is $20, plus the cost per pound, which is $1.5.  The total cost of the blueberries is calculated as follows:

* **Total cost of blueberries:** 30 pounds * $1.5/pound = $45

Next, we need to compare this cost to the cost at the store, which is $2.5 per pound.  The cost at the store is calculated as:

* **Cost at the store:** 30 pounds * $2.5/pound = $75

Finally, we can determine the savings James achieved by comparing the two costs:

* **Savings:** $75 - $65 = $10


Therefore, James saved $10 by picking his own blueberries.

"Ron faces a classic economic dilemma.  The cost of repairing the pothole, while seemingly straightforward, involves a complex interplay of opportunity cost and potential future damage.  

Let's analyze the situation:

* **Direct Costs:** Ron incurs a direct cost of $75 for the asphalt, plus a potential fine of $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. This brings the total cost to $195.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The $195 spent on repairs represents a potential loss of future savings.  If the pothole is left unfixed, it could cause $450 worth of damage to Ron's car. This represents a significant opportunity cost.

**Conclusion:**  While the initial cost of fixing the pothole is substantial, the potential for future damage to his car outweighs the cost of the repair.  Ron would be better off fixing the pothole, as it would prevent a larger financial loss in the future.

"The average time taken by the cat and dog to consume the sausages can be determined by first calculating the individual rates of consumption.  The cat consumes 9 sausages in 30 minutes, implying a rate of 9/30 = 0.3 sausages per minute.  The dog, on the other hand, consumes sausages at a rate of 2/3 the cat's rate, which is (2/3) * 0.3 = 0.2 sausages per minute.

To find the total time, we can use the formula:

Total time = (Total sausages) / (Rate of consumption)

The total sausages are 9.  The rate of consumption for the cat is 0.3 sausages per minute, and for the dog is 0.2 sausages per minute.  Therefore, the total time is 9 / (0.3 + 0.2) = 9 / 0.5 = 18 minutes.

The average time taken by the cat and dog to consume the sausages is 18 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  We need to find the length of Bobby's shoe.

First, we need to convert all measurements to inches.  Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equal to 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.

Let 'x' represent the length of Bobby's shoe.  We can set up an equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Solving for x, we get:

100 - 10 = 9x
90 = 9x
x = 10

Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is **10 inches** long.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let Dora's age be represented by the variable 'd'.** 
* **Dora's father's age is represented by '2d + 8'.** This is because his age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
* **Dora's mother's age is represented by '2d + 4'.** This is because she is four years younger than Dora's father.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total combined age:

d + (2d + 8) + (2d + 4) = 87

**Simplifying the equation:**

5d + 12 = 87

**Solving for 'd':**

5d = 75
d = 15

**Therefore, Dora is 15 years old.**

* **Dora's father's age is 2(15) + 8 = 38 years old.**
* **Dora's mother's age is 2(15) + 4 = 34 years old.**

**Finally, the total combined age is 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years.**

"Let's analyze Mark's card purchase and sales.  

First, we need to determine the total cost of the packs.  He purchased 3 packs at $1800 each, resulting in a total cost of 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Next, we need to consider the value of the two special cards he acquired.  These cards are worth $4000 and $1000, totaling $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

Finally, we need to calculate the value of the additional cards.  He acquired 30 cards at an average of $50 each, resulting in a total value of 30 * $50 = $1500.

To determine Mark's profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of his cards.  This gives us $5000 + $1500 - $5400 = $0. 


Therefore, Mark did not make a profit.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the vote passed with twice the number of votes in favor as against it.  This means we can represent the number of votes against the regulation as 'x'.  The number of votes in favor is then 2x.  The total number of votes is the sum of these two, which is 33.  We can set up an equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combining like terms, we get:

3x = 33

Solving for x, we divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

Now, we can find the number of votes in favor:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally.

* **Billy's initial hourly rate:** $10
* **First raise:** $0.50 increase, resulting in an hourly rate of $10.50
* **Anniversary raise:** $1.00 increase, resulting in an hourly rate of $11.50

**Sally's starting salary:**  We are given that Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary, so her starting rate is $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00.

**Billy's earnings for 20 hours:** 20 hours * $11.50/hour = $230.00

**Sally's earnings for 20 hours:** 20 hours * $11.00/hour = $220.00

**Difference in earnings:** $230.00 - $220.00 = $10.00


**Answer:** Billy will earn $10.00 more than Sally.

"To determine the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should purchase to achieve a 30% representation within her collection, we first need to calculate the total number of stuffed animals she currently possesses.  

This is achieved by summing the number of each type of stuffed animal: 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14.

Next, we need to determine the desired number of goats.  We are aiming for 30% of her total collection, which translates to 0.30 * 14 = 4.2 goats. 

Since we cannot purchase fractions of animals, Bubbles should purchase **5** stuffed goats to achieve her desired percentage.

"To determine the overall pass rate, we need to consider the pass rates of each grade level and then calculate the weighted average. 

* **Third Grade:** 340 out of 500 students passed, giving a pass rate of 0.68 (340/500).
* **Fourth Grade:** 40 out of 100 students passed, giving a pass rate of 0.40.
* **Fifth Grade:**  The pass rate for fifth grade is twice that of the fourth grade, so it is 0.80.

To calculate the overall pass rate, we need to sum the pass rates of each grade level and then divide by the total number of students. 

The overall pass rate is calculated as follows:

(0.68 + 0.40 + 0.80) / 3 = 1.88

The overall pass rate is 1.88, which is equivalent to 188%.

"The problem describes a geometric sequence where the number of students doubles each month.  To find the total number of students added, we can calculate the sum of the geometric series. 

The first term is 10 students. The common ratio is 2.  The number of months is 5.  The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:
* S = the sum of the series
* a = the first term
* r = the common ratio
* n = the number of terms

Plugging in the values:

S = 10 (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 10 (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 10 (-31) / (-1)
S = 310

Therefore, **310** additional students joined the campus by the end of May.

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we need to consider the total earnings and the cost per branch.  

We know Felix earned $105 and each branch costs $0.25.  Therefore, we can calculate the total number of branches climbed by dividing his earnings by the cost per branch:

$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches climbed by the number of days:

420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches/day

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Initial Flowers:** Rose begins with 3 flowers with 5 petals each, totaling 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
* **Second Group:** She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, resulting in 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
* **Third Group:**  Adding 5 flowers with 4 petals each, we get 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
* **Fourth Group:**  The final group has 6 flowers with 7 petals each, totaling 6 * 7 = 42 petals.
* **Total Petals:**  The total number of petals before dropping any is 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.
* **Dropping Flowers:**  Rose loses one of each type of flower, resulting in 101 - 1 = 100 flowers.
* **Final Petals:**  The total number of petals in the vase is 100 flowers * 7 petals/flower = 700 petals.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We are given that Tanya creates a 10-ounce mixture.  We need to determine the amount of oil she uses.  

* **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    * Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    * Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    * Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Establish Relationships:**
    *  We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    *  We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    *  We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    *  We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    *  We know the total mixture is 10 ounces.

* **Solve for Oil (o):**
    *  Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    *  Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    *  Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x
    *  We know x = zest, so o = 4z.

* **Determine the Amount of Oil:**

"John's total expenditure can be determined by summing the cost of the goats and the cows.  

* **Goats:** 3 goats * $500/goat = $1500
* **Cows:** 2 cows * $1500/cow = $3000
* **Total:** $1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500.

"To determine the number of cupcakes Paul needs to purchase, we first calculate the total number of cupcakes he currently possesses: 8 + 40 = 48.  Subtracting this from the total number of cupcakes required (63), we find the shortfall: 63 - 48 = 15.  Therefore, Paul must purchase 15 more cupcakes. 

**Answer:** 15

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Joe's initial cars:** Joe has twice the number of cars Robert has, who has 20. Therefore, Joe possesses 2 * 20 = 40 cars.
* **Sales:** Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.
* **Gifts to mother:** Joe gives away twice the number of cars sold to his mother, meaning he gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.
* **Remaining cars:**  Joe starts with 40 cars and sells 8, then gives away 16, leaving him with 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars.


**Answer:** 16

"The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000.  Of this amount, $50,000 was received from organizations.  Therefore, the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.  Since there are 20 students, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Day 1:** Sandy walked for 8 hours.
* **Day 2:** She walked half as many hours as Day 1, so she walked 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.
* **Total Time:** The total time is 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours.
* **Time in Minutes:**  12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

* **Initial count:** Hunter begins with 50 cars.
* **First break:**  The number increases by 20 cars, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.
* **Lunch break:**  Half of the cars are gone, meaning 70 / 2 = 35 cars are remaining.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

"To determine the difference in the number of tins of cat food and dog food, we first need to calculate the total number of tins of each type of food.  

* Cat food: 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins
* Dog food: 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins

The difference is then found by subtracting the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins: 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins. 

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 


**Answer:** 52

"Let's analyze the given information to determine the number of cards Becca possesses.

Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying the equation:
7x + 12 = 341

Solving for x:
7x = 329
x = 47

Therefore, PJ has 47 cards.  Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  

* **Blue eggs:**  The problem states Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she has 5 green eggs. Therefore, she has 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* **Pink eggs:**  She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
* **Yellow eggs:** The problem states she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, meaning she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
* **Total eggs:**  Adding the number of each color of egg, Cindy has 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

Therefore, Cindy has a total of 27 eggs.

"Let's analyze the situation.  

First, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book. The shipping company charges a fixed fee of $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  The book weighs 4 pounds, so the shipping cost is 4 * $0.35 = $1.40.  The book is 20 miles away, so the mileage cost is 20 * $0.08 = $1.60.  Therefore, the total cost of shipping is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we need to determine the amount of the refund. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32.  The refund amount is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, we can calculate the amount Milly will lose. The total cost of the book, including shipping, is $3.00.  The refund amount is $24.00.  Therefore, Milly will lose $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00.

"Let's break down the problem:

Mulan begins with $40. Her father gives her an additional $100.  She then purchases two pairs of jeans at $30 each, totaling $60, and a bag for $20.  

To find her remaining balance, we need to calculate the total cost of the items and then subtract that from her initial amount.

* **Total cost of items:** $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80
* **Mulan's remaining balance:** $140 (initial amount) - $80 (total cost) = $60

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

"Let's break down the production pattern:

* **Week 1:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
* **Week 2:**  He produces half of Week 1's output, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He produces three times the output of Week 1, resulting in 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:**  The total production is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find the production for week 4, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.


**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Let's break down Britany's TikTok time.  

* **Video creation:** 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes
* **Songwriting:** 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes
* **Makeup:** 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes
* **Total weekly time:** 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes

To calculate her monthly time, we need to consider the 4-week period.  Therefore, her monthly TikTok time is 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1128 minutes. 


**Answer:** 1128 minutes

"Let's break down the cost of Angela's installation. 

The base installation fee is $129.00.  Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that need to be hung.  

* **Mirrors:**  The installation cost for each mirror is $15.00.  Angela has 6 mirrors, so the cost for the mirrors is 6 * $15.00 = $90.00.
* **Chandeliers:** The installation cost for each chandelier is $15.00. Angela has 2 chandeliers, so the cost for the chandeliers is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
* **Pictures:** The installation cost for each picture is $15.00. Angela has 20 pictures, so the cost for the pictures is 20 * $15.00 = $300.00.

The total cost of the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Eva's savings:** Eva saved $20.00.
* **Anthony's savings:** Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
* **Roy's savings:** Roy saved 40% more than Anthony, which translates to a 1.40 multiplier.  Therefore, Roy's savings are 1.40 * $30.00 = $42.00.

**Answer:** Roy has $42.00. 
"
"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.  We are given a series of relationships between the lifting abilities of four individuals: Naruto, Kagiyami, Saskay, and Pompei.  

* **Pompei's lifting ability:** We are given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
* **Saskay's lifting ability:**  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, meaning she can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.
* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, meaning she can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami, meaning he can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

To find Naruto's lifting ability in feet, we need to convert his lifting height in inches to feet.  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can divide Naruto's lifting height in inches by 12 to get his height in feet. 

Therefore, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = **40 feet**.

"To determine Mason's total distance traveled, we need to consider the time spent cycling and the rest period. 

* **First leg:**  He travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours, covering a distance of 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles.
* **Rest:** The duration of the rest period is unknown. 
* **Second leg:** He continues cycling for another 6 hours at a rate of 8 miles per hour, covering a distance of 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles.

To calculate the total distance, we need to consider the rest period.  

**Therefore, the total distance traveled is 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles.** 


"
"The key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between distance, time, and speed.  

Let's break it down:

* **Kangaroos:**  We know the total time for 3 kangaroos to travel a certain distance is 18 hours. This means the distance is directly proportional to the time, and the speed of the kangaroos is constant.
* **Turtles:**  We are asked to find the time it takes four turtles to cover the same distance.  The turtles travel at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is a factor in determining the time.

**The key is to recognize that the distance is constant, and the time is directly proportional to the speed.** 

Therefore, the time taken by four turtles will be inversely proportional to the speed of the turtles. 

**Answer:** 36 hours 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Kora's production:** We know Kora made 20 clay dishes.
* **Rory's production:** Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so she made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.
* **Jada's production:** Jada produced twice the number of dishes as Rory, meaning she made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.
* **Total production:**  To find the total number of dishes, we add the individual production: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.


Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they made together is 140.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Erika's desired laptop costs $600.
* The trade-in discount reduces the price to $600 - $200 = $400.
* She has $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mother, totaling $150 + $80 = $230.
* Erika needs an additional $50 to purchase the laptop.

Therefore, her current savings are $230 + $50 = $280. 


**Answer:** $280

"To determine the number of apple slices remaining, we need to consider the total number of slices from the large and small apples.  

* **Large apple slices:** 3 large apples * 5 slices/apple = 15 slices
* **Small apple slices:** 5 small apples * 3 slices/apple = 15 slices
* **Total slices:** 15 slices + 15 slices = 30 slices
* **Slices left:** 30 slices - 15 slices = 15 slices

Therefore, there are **15** apple slices left.

"To determine the number of additional cows needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day, we need to consider the current milk production and the desired output. 

The farmer currently produces 15 liters of milk per day from his three cows. To reach the desired 25 liters, he needs to increase his production by 10 liters.  

Therefore, he needs to acquire an additional number of cows that can produce 10 liters of milk each.  

**Answer:** The farmer needs to acquire **2** additional cows. 
"
"To determine the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we first need to find the total length of glue used.  

The total length of glue used is the sum of the lengths of the three partially used glue sticks.  

*  The first glue stick has 1/6 of its original length remaining.
*  The second glue stick has 2/3 of its original length remaining.
*  The third glue stick has 1/2 of its original length remaining.

To find the total length of glue used, we need to add the lengths of these three partially used glue sticks. 

The total length of glue used is: (1/6) + (2/3) + (1/2) = 1/6 + 4/6 + 3/6 = 8/6 = 4/3 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the difference between the original length of the glue sticks and the length of glue used. 

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is: 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 12 mm - (4/3) mm = 36 mm - 4 mm = 32 mm.

"Gabriel needs $5600 more to purchase the car and phone. 
 
 **Answer:** $5600 
"
"Thea paid $80 in total.  To find the change, we subtract the amount paid from the original price: $70 - $80 = -$10.  This result indicates that Thea received a negative amount, which is not possible in a real-world scenario.  Therefore, there is an error in the problem statement.

"Let's break down Craig's spending.  He begins with $20 in cash and spends $12 on squirt guns and $9 on water balloons.  The total cost of these purchases is $12 + $9 = $21.  Therefore, Craig has $20 - $21 = -$1 remaining.  This result indicates that Craig is actually in debt. 


**Answer:** -$1

"Let's break down the problem systematically. 

* **Jack's socks:**  We know Jack has 60 dishes.  Since he has twice as many dishes as socks, we can find the number of socks by dividing the number of dishes by 2: 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
* **Peter's socks:** Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
* **Total socks:**  Peter and Jack have a total of 60 + 30 = 90 socks.
* **Jack's dishes:** Jack has 60 dishes.
* **Peter's dishes:** Peter has 60 socks, and we know he has half the number of dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
* **Total dishes:** Jack and Peter have a total of 60 + 30 = 90 dishes.
* **Total:**  The total number of socks and dishes is 90 + 90 = 180.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total Students:** 20
* **Students excelling in Math Only:** 5
* **Students excelling in English Only:** 8
* **Students Excelling in Both:**  We need to find the number of students who are proficient in both subjects.

To find the number of students proficient in both, we can use the following equation:

Total Students - Students excelling in Math Only - Students excelling in English Only = Students proficient in both

20 - 5 - 8 = 7

"To determine the number of groups Vicki can accommodate, we need to consider the total time allocated for the concert and the time each group requires. 

The concert is 2 hours long, which translates to 120 minutes.  Each group requires 10 minutes for setup, 6 minutes for performance, and 2 minutes for exit.  

Therefore, the total time per group is 10 + 6 + 2 = 18 minutes.

To find the number of groups that can perform, we divide the total concert time by the time per group: 120 minutes / 18 minutes/group = 6.67.

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round down to the nearest whole number.  

**Answer:** 6 groups.

"The interest earned on the investment is calculated as simple interest, which is calculated using the formula:

* **I = P * r * t**

Where:

* I = Interest
* P = Principal (initial investment)
* r = Annual interest rate (as a decimal)
* t = Time (in years)

In this case, the principal (P) is $300, the annual interest rate (r) is 3/4 (or 0.75 as a decimal), and the time (t) is 3 years.  

Therefore, the total interest earned over 3 years is:

* I = $300 * 0.75 * 3 = $675

The total amount after 3 years is the principal plus the interest:

* Total amount = $300 + $675 = $975


**Answer:** $975

"The key to this problem is to break it down into manageable parts.  We are asked to find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars. 

* **White shirts with collars:**  We know there are 40 white shirts and half of them have collars, so there are 40 / 2 = 20 shirts with collars.
* **White shirts without collars:**  We can find the number of white shirts without collars by subtracting the number with collars from the total number of white shirts: 40 - 20 = 20 shirts.
* **Floral shirts with buttons:** We are given that 20 floral shirts have buttons.
* **Floral shirts without buttons:**  To find the number of floral shirts without buttons, we subtract the number with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30 shirts.
* **Difference:** Finally, we find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars: 30 - 20 = 10 shirts.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Goats sold from Farm X:**  Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
* **Goats sold from Farm Y:** He sold twice the number of goats from Farm Y, so he sold 10 * 2 = 20 goats.
* **Total goats sold:**  The total number of goats sold is 10 + 20 = 30 goats.
* **Goats remaining on Farm X:**  Mr. Smith has 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats remaining.
* **Goats remaining on Farm Y:** He has 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats remaining.
* **Total goats remaining:** The total number of goats remaining is 45 + 25 = 70 goats.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We are given a system of equations representing the relationships between the ages of the individuals:

*  Let 'x' represent your age.
*  Your brother's age is 'x + 3'.
*  Your sister's age is 'x - 2'.

The problem states that the sum of your ages is 87.  This translates to the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87

"To determine the number of glue stick packs Mr. Jackson needs, we first calculate the total glue sticks required.  Since each student needs 2 glue sticks, and there are 27 students, the total glue sticks needed is 27 * 2 = 54.  

Next, we divide the total glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack (8). This gives us 54 / 8 = 6.75 packs.  

Since we can't purchase fractions of packs, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to purchase **7** packs of glue sticks.

"The spread of the plague can be modeled using a simple exponential growth function.  Let's denote the number of infected individuals as *N(t)*, where *t* represents the number of days.  

The rate of infection is given by the product of the number of infected individuals and the number of new infections per infected individual.  

* **Day 1:**  *N(1) = 10*
* **Day 2:** *N(2) = 10 * 6 = 60*
* **Day 3:** *N(3) = 60 * 6 = 360*

The pattern continues, and we can see that the number of infected individuals grows exponentially. 

**Therefore, after three days, there are 2630 infected individuals.**

"Let's break down the cost calculation.  We are given the following information:

* The cost of 7 soda bottles is $21.00.
* The cost of 4 water bottles is $8.00.

We want to determine the cost of 3 soda bottles and 2 water bottles.

**Cost of a single soda bottle:**

*  We can find the cost per soda bottle by dividing the total cost of 7 soda bottles by the number of soda bottles: $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

**Cost of a single water bottle:**

* Similarly, we can find the cost per water bottle by dividing the total cost of 4 water bottles by the number of water bottles: $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

**Total cost of 3 soda bottles:**

*  The cost of 3 soda bottles is calculated by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

**Total cost of 2 water bottles:**

* The cost of 2 water bottles is calculated by multiplying the cost per bottle by the number of bottles: $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

**Total cost:**

* Finally, we add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water to find the total cost: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

First, we need to calculate the cost of the chicken.  Since each pack of chicken costs twice the price of bacon, we can find the cost of a single pack of bacon by dividing the total cost of the bacon by the number of packs: $10 / 5 = $2 per pack.  The cost of the chicken is then $2 * 6 = $12.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the strawberries. Each pack of strawberries costs $4, and Kelly has 3 packs, so the total cost is $4 * 3 = $12.

Finally, we need to calculate the cost of the apples. Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so they cost $4 / 2 = $2 per pack. Kelly has 7 packs, so the total cost is $2 * 7 = $14.

To find the total cost of all the items, we add the cost of the bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples: $10 + $120 + $12 + $14 = $156.

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget to find the amount of money she has left: $65 - $156 = -$91.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the final concert is twice the length of Elaina's usual concerts, and it includes a 15-minute encore.  We need to find the length of her usual concerts. 

The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, and this includes the extended duration of the concert and the encore.  

Let's denote the length of a typical concert as 'x'.  We can set up an equation:

2 * x + 15 = 65

Solving for x:

2 * x = 65 - 15
2 * x = 50
x = 50 / 2
x = 25

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for **25 minutes**.

"The problem can be solved by breaking down the information into steps.  

* **Indoor plants:**  One-fourth of the total number of plants is indoor, so there are 100 plants / 4 = 25 indoor plants.
* **Remaining plants:**  This leaves 100 plants - 25 plants = 75 plants.
* **Outdoor plants:** Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor, so there are 75 plants * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.
* **Flowering plants:**  The remaining plants are the flowering plants, so there are 75 plants - 50 plants = 25 flowering plants.
* **Percentage of flowering plants:**  The percentage of flowering plants is (25 plants / 100 plants) * 100% = 25%.


Therefore, 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

"Let's break down the problem. We are given the following information:

*  A whatchamacallit spins 121 meters per second.
*  A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. 
*  A whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob.

To find the speed of a whirligig, we can use the following logic:

1. **Find the speed of a thingamabob:**  Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, we can determine the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11. 
2. **Find the speed of a whirligig:** The whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, so we can multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5 to find the speed of the whirligig.

Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is 121 meters per second * 5 = 605 meters per second. 


**Answer:** 605 meters per second

"Let's break down the problem. Susan begins with 100 cookies and intends to distribute them equally among her 6 nephews. However, her husband takes 4 cookies, reducing the total available cookies. 

To find the number of cookies each nephew receives, we need to consider the initial distribution and the husband's deduction.  

The initial distribution would be 100 cookies / 6 nephews = 16.67 cookies per nephew.  

After the husband's snack, the remaining cookies are 100 - 4 = 96.  

Therefore, each nephew would receive 96 / 6 = 16 cookies.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**1. Cost of the Balloons:**

* The balloons cost $0.50 for 2 balloons, so a dozen (12 balloons) costs $0.50 * 60 = $30.00.

**2. Total Cost of the Cake and Balloons:**

* The cake costs $11.00 and the balloons cost $30.00, for a total of $11.00 + $30.00 = $41.00.

**3. Cost of the Ice Cream:**

* Two tubs of ice cream cost $7.00 each, so they cost $7.00 * 2 = $14.00.

**4. Total Cost:**

* The total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream is $41.00 + $14.00 = $55.00.

**5. Allowance per Girl:**

* They had $55.00 and divided it between the two girls, so each girl received $55.00 / 2 = $27.50.


**Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each girl $27.50.**

"To determine the total calorie count of Andrew's pastries, we need to consider the calorie content of each pastry type and the number of each type baked. 

First, we need to calculate the calorie content of a mini version of each pastry.  A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini version has 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories. Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini version has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.

Next, we can calculate the total calories for the cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, which have a total of 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories. He also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, which have a total of 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories.

Finally, the total calorie count for all pastries is 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

"To calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we first need to determine the total number of Junebugs removed across all days.  

The total number of Junebugs removed is 39 (Monday) + 78 (Tuesday + Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 192.

Next, we divide the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days to find the average: 192 Junebugs / 5 days = 38.4 Junebugs per day. 

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 38.4.

"To determine the number of bouncy balls, we need to isolate the quantity of bouncy balls from the total number of toys.  

We know the total number of toys is 62.  We also know the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and rings are 31, 8, and 9 respectively.  

Subtracting the sum of these other toys from the total number of toys gives us the number of bouncy balls: 62 - 31 - 8 - 9 = 14.

Therefore, Sophie's tube of bouncy balls contained **14** balls.

"Let's break down the problem systematically. 

We are given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.  We are also given that Paul is 10 years older than John.  Finally, we are told that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages.

Let's use variables to represent their ages:

*  Let Peter's age be represented by ""P""
*  Let Paul's age be represented by ""P + 10"" (since he's 10 years older than John)
*  Let John's age be represented by ""J""

Now, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

1.  P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of all three is 100)
2.  P = P + 10 + J (Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

Solving for John's age (J) in the second equation:

J = 100 - 2P

Now, substitute this value of J into the first equation:

P + P + (100 - 2P) = 100

Simplify and solve for P:

2P + 100 - 2P = 100
100 = 100

This equation is true, which means our initial assumptions are consistent. 

We can now solve for P:

P = 100 - 10
P = 90

Therefore, Peter's age is 90.

"To determine the average total distance spat, we first need to calculate the total distance for each contestant. Zoey's distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds she spits (40) by the distance per seed (10 feet), resulting in 400 feet. Similarly, Sydney's distance is calculated by multiplying the number of seeds she spits (35) by the distance per seed (12 feet), resulting in 420 feet. 

The total distance spat is then the sum of these two distances: 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet.

Finally, to find the average distance, we divide the total distance by the number of contestants, which is 2.  This gives us an average distance of 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

"Fern's decision hinges on a comparison of the production output and revenue generated by each machine.  

Let's break down the analysis:

* **Widgeteer 3000:** Produces 60 widgets per hour, operating for 24 hours a day for 30 days, resulting in a daily production of 60 * 24 * 30 = $7200.
* **WidgetMaster 9000:** Produces 45 widgets per hour, operating for 24 hours a day for 30 days, resulting in a daily production of 45 * 24 * 30 = $32400.

The WidgetMaster 9000 generates a significantly higher daily production, leading to a higher potential revenue. 

**Therefore, Fern would experience a net loss of $25200 if she chooses the WidgetMaster 9000.**

"Let's break down the cost analysis.  

The hotel offers two pricing options: a standard 12-hour stay for ₱1000 and a 24-hour stay for ₱1600.  

Cameron's stay begins at 5 pm and ends at 10 am the next day, a total of 12 hours.  

Since he chooses to add ₱70 for each additional hour, we need to determine the cost of the additional hours. 

The cost of the additional hours is ₱70/hour * 2 hours = ₱140.

The total cost of Cameron's stay is ₱1000 (standard rate) + ₱140 (additional hours) = ₱1140.

Therefore, Cameron would save ₱1600 - ₱1140 = ₱460.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Sheep Hay:** Each sheep requires 7 pounds of hay (twice the goat's need minus 3 pounds).
* **Total Sheep Hay:**  We have 12 sheep, so their total hay requirement is 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds.
* **Goat Hay:**  We have 15 goats, and each needs 5 pounds of hay. Their total hay requirement is 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds.
* **Total Hay:**  The total hay needed is the sum of the sheep and goat hay: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = 159 pounds.


Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay.

"Let's break down the problem. James initially purchases 10 CDs at a cost of $15 each, totaling $150.  He receives a 40% discount, reducing the price to $90.  He then sells 5 of the CDs for $40 each, generating $200 in revenue.  

To determine his net loss, we need to consider the total cost of the CDs he kept.  The cost of the CDs he kept is $90.  

Therefore, James' net loss is $150 - $90 = -$60. 


**Answer:** James was out $60. 
"
"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate the revenue generated from each type of root crop and then sum the amounts. 

* **Yams:** Jen has 6 yams, each selling for $1.50.  Therefore, her revenue from yams is 6 * $1.50 = $9.00.
* **Sweet Potatoes:** She has 10 sweet potatoes, each selling for $2.00. Her revenue from sweet potatoes is 10 * $2.00 = $20.00.
* **Carrots:** Jen has 4 carrots, each selling for $1.25. Her revenue from carrots is 4 * $1.25 = $5.00.

Finally, adding the revenue from each type of root crop, we get $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00. 


Therefore, Jen will earn $34.00 from the sale of her root crops.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Distance:** James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 20 miles * 0.60 = 12 miles.
* **Swimming Time:**  He swims at a rate of 2 miles per hour, so the time taken is 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours.
* **Rest Time:**  He rests for half the swimming time, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.
* **Remaining Distance:**  The remaining distance is 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles.
* **Final Speed:**  He swims at half the speed for the remaining distance, so his speed is 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour.
* **Time for Remaining Distance:**  The time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours.
* **Total Time:**  The total time taken is the sum of the swimming, rest, and remaining time: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.


Therefore, it took James **17 hours** to cross the lake.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had last Friday.  We know Sam had 70 loaves.  

To find the number of loaves the bakery has, we can set up an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the number of loaves the bakery has.
* We know the bakery has 40 less than seven times Sam's loaves, so:  x = 7 * 70 - 40

Simplifying the equation:
* x = 490 - 40
* x = 450

Therefore, the bakery has **450** loaves of bread.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Deanna is 26 years old.
* Marcus is half of Leo's age, meaning Marcus's age is equal to 1/2 of Leo's age.
* We are also given that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.

Therefore, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between their ages:

* Let Leo's age be represented by the variable 'L'.
* Marcus's age is then L/2.

We can now use the given information to form an equation:

* L/2 = 26 - 5 

Solving for L:

* L/2 = 21
* L = 21 * 2
* L = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  

We are given that the team scored a total of 45 points, with each player contributing equally.  Let's represent the points scored by each player with the following variables:

*  Let D represent Dinar's score.
*  Let A represent Azibo's score.
*  Let B represent Bahati's score.

We are given the following relationships:

*  B = A + 20 
*  B = D + 10
*  A + D + B = 45

From the first two equations, we can substitute to eliminate B:

*  D + 10 = A + 20
*  A = D - 10

Now, substitute this value of A into the third equation:

*  (D - 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplify and solve for D:

*  3D + 10 = 45
*  3D = 35
*  D = 11.67 (approximately)

Finally, substitute the value of D back into the equation for A:

*  A = D - 10
*  A = 11.67 - 10
*  A = 1.67 (approximately)

Therefore, Azibo scored approximately 1.67 points.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Jen's total expenses for supplies are $400.  The cost of travel is 50% more than the supplies, meaning it's 1.50 times the cost of the supplies.  

To find the cost of travel, we can set up an equation:

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the travel.
* The cost of travel is 1.50 times the cost of supplies, so it's 1.50x.
* The total cost of supplies and travel is $400, so we have the equation: 400 = x + 1.50x

Solving for 'x', we get:

* Combine like terms: 400 = 2.50x
* Divide both sides by 2.50: x = 160

"Let's analyze the given information to determine the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.

We are given that Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have a total of 339 Pokemon.  We can represent the number of Pokemon each person has caught with the following variables:

*  Let A represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
*  Let S represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
*  Let W represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following relationships:

*  A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
*  S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch)
*  A + S + W = 339 (Total Pokemon caught)

To solve for Stan's catch (S), we can use a combination of substitution and algebraic manipulation. 

**Step 1: Substitute to eliminate variables**

We can substitute the first equation (A = S + 5) into the third equation:

(S + 5) + S + W = 339

**Step 2: Simplify and solve for W**

Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339

We can substitute the second equation (S = 4W - 13) into this equation:

2(4W - 13) + W = 339

Simplify: 8W - 26 + W = 339

Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339

Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365

Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56.  We'll round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon.

**Step 3: Solve for S**

Now that we know W = 41, we can substitute it back into the second equation:

S = 4(41) - 13

Simplify: S = 164 - 13

Therefore: S = 151

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Let's break down the problem.  The key is to understand the relationship between the number of episodes and the total time.  We are given that there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode.  This means the number of episodes is equal to the number of minutes divided by 20. 

Therefore, the total viewing time is simply the number of episodes multiplied by the length of each episode. 

**Answer:** 20 minutes

"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to consider the bird's movements as a series of segments. 

First, the bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, covering a distance of 300 miles.  Next, she turns north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, covering a distance of 36 miles.  Finally, she flies south again for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, covering a distance of 110 miles.

To find the total distance, we sum the distances traveled in each segment: 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles. 

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Nani's age:**  Nani is 8 years old.
* **Brother's age:**  Nani's brother is twice her age, so he is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.
* **Sister's age:**  Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, meaning she is 8 - (8 * 0.25) = 6 years old.

Finally, the total age of the family is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.

"To determine the total time required to string all the racquets, we need to consider the time spent on each type of stringing. 

* **Synthetic gut:** 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
* **Polyester:** 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
* **Hybrid:** 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Adding these times together gives us a total of 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes. 

Therefore, it will take Andy **227 minutes** to string all the racquets.

"Let's break down the cost of John's phone purchases.  

* **Phones for John and his kids:**  The initial two phones cost $600 each, totaling $600 * 2 = $1200.
* **Phones for the kids:**  The remaining phones are half-price, so each of the subsequent phones costs $600 / 2 = $300.  The total cost for the kids' phones is $300 * (number of kids - 2) = $300 * (2 - 2) = $0.
* **Phones for the wife:** The wife's phone costs $600.
* **Total cost:** The total cost of the phones is $1200 + $600 + $600 = $2400.

"Let's break down the problem.  India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.  This translates to the following equation:

* Let 'x' represent the number of states in the USA.
* India has 'x + 4' states.

We know that the total number of states in both countries is the sum of the states in each country.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) = Total States

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4 = Total States

To find the total number of states, we need to find the value of 'x'.  Since the USA has 50 states, we can substitute that into the equation:

2 * 50 + 4 = Total States

100 + 4 = Total States

104 = Total States

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries is 104.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the cost of Pat's flower bed project. 

First, we need to convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches.  Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, the length is 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches.

Next, we need to determine the spacing between plants.  The spacing is 1.5 feet, meaning each plant is separated by 1.5 feet.

To calculate the total number of plants Pat can fit, we divide the total length of the bed in inches by the spacing between plants: 1332 inches / 1.5 feet/plant = 888 plants.

Finally, we need to determine the total cost of the plants.  Since each plant costs $6, the total cost is 888 plants * $6/plant = $5226.

"The cost of petunias is $3.00 per plant, and sweet potato vines are $2.50 each.  To find the total cost for all 5 baskets, we need to consider the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines for each basket and then multiply that by the total number of baskets. 

The cost of petunias per basket is $9.00 (3 petunias * $3.00/petunia). The cost of sweet potato vines per basket is $5.00 (2 vines * $2.50/vine).  Therefore, the total cost per basket is $14.00.  

Finally, the total cost for all 5 baskets is $70.00.

"To determine the number of roses they can plant, we need to consider the total weight of the soil and the weight of the plants.  

First, we need to determine the total weight of the carnations and sunflowers.  The carnations require 1.5 pounds per plant, and they have 10 plants, so they require 10 * 1.5 = 15 pounds.  The sunflowers require 3 pounds per plant, and they have 4 plants, so they require 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.  

The total weight of the plants is 15 + 12 = 27 pounds.  

Finally, we need to determine how much soil is left.  They have 30 pounds of soil and 27 pounds of plants, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.  

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 pounds / 1 pound/rose = 3 roses.

"To determine the total time required, we need to consider the time spent on both peeling and cooking. 

* **Peeling:**  Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.
* **Cooking:**  Emily can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To cook 90 shrimp, it will take 90 / 30 = 3 minutes.

Therefore, the total time required is 15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Understanding the Relationship:** The problem presents a scenario where the comet's orbital period is a constant, and we need to determine Bill's age at the first sighting. 

* **Key Information:**
    * The comet's orbital period is 75 years.
    * Bill's father saw the comet at age 30.
    * Bill saw the comet at age 90.

* **Solving for Bill's Age at First Sighting:**
    * Bill's age at the second sighting is 90 years.
    * The time between the two sightings is 90 - 30 = 60 years.
    * Since the comet orbits every 75 years, we can determine the time elapsed since the first sighting. 
    * Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he first saw the comet.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

* **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
    *  Let 'y' represent the number of flights to France.

* **Establish Relationships:**
    * The first plane flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
    * The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between flights to France and Germany.
    * The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, making 22 trips.

* **Formulate Equations:**
    * We know the other plane makes 22 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes. Therefore, we can write the equation: 22 = (1/2) * x
    * We also know that the first plane makes (3/4)x flights to Greece, and the remaining (1/4)x flights are split between France and Germany. 

* **Solve for x:**
    *  Solving the equation 22 = (1/2) * x, we get x = 44.

**Therefore, the first plane makes 44 flights in a day.** 



"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Tobias' howl:**  Each howl lasts 20 seconds.
* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote's howl is twice as long as Tobias's, so it lasts 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous's howl is equal to the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

To find the total howl time, we simply add the durations of each wolf's howl: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Finally, convert the total howl time to minutes: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem systematically. 

* **Define variables:**
    * Let  'x' represent Wilfred's age.
    * We know the average age of the group is 5 years.
    * We know Helene is twice the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10 years.
    * We know Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.

* **Formulate the equation:**
    * The total age of the children is 20 years.  
    * This can be expressed as: 3 + 4 + 10 + x = 20

* **Solve for x:**
    * Combining like terms: 17 + x = 20
    * Subtracting 17 from both sides: x = 3

**Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old.**

"Let's break down this problem to understand the relationship between the slices and the total watermelon.  

We are given that each adult receives a slice that is twice the size of a child's slice.  This means the adult's slice is represented by 2x, where x represents the size of a child's slice.  

The total number of slices is 6, representing the combination of 2 adults and 4 children.  

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult receives, we need to consider the proportion of the total slices that each adult gets.  

**The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is calculated as:**

(2x / 6) * 100%

**Simplifying this expression, we get:**

(x/3) * 100%


**Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (x/3) * 100%.**

"The Smith family needs to determine the cost of filling their swimming pool.  

First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool.  The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth.  In this case, the dimensions are 14 feet by 25 feet by 4 feet.  Therefore, the volume is:

* Volume = 14 feet * 25 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.  One cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons.  Therefore, the volume in gallons is:

* Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10392 gallons.

Finally, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so the total cost is:

* Cost = 10392 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $1039.20.

* **Trey's laps:** Trey runs 4 more laps than Bethany, so he runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps per hour.
* **Shaelyn's laps:** Shaelyn runs half the number of laps as Trey, meaning she runs 14 / 2 = 7 laps per hour.
* **Quinn's laps:** Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so he runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps per hour.
* **Difference:** To find the difference between Bethany and Quinn's laps, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps: 10 - 5 = 5.


**Answer:** Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**Day 1:**

* Wanda fills 1/4 * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.
* Ms. B pumps 3/4 * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.
* Total pumped on day 1: 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

**Day 2:**

* Wanda pumps 2/3 * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.
* Ms. B pumps 1/3 * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.
* Total pumped on day 2: 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

**Total pumped in two days:** 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons

**Gallons remaining:** 18000 - 12000 = **6000 gallons**


**Answer:** 6000

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.  

We are given that the power bank's capacity is decreasing at a rate of 9% per hour for the first 5 hours and then 7% per hour for the next 3 hours.  We need to determine the initial charge of the power bank.

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Initial Charge:**  We're given that the power bank was fully charged initially. Let's represent the initial charge as 'x'.
* **Loss Rate:** The power bank loses 9% of its charge per hour for the first 5 hours.
* **Loss Rate:** The power bank loses 7% of its charge per hour for the next 3 hours.

**Solving the Problem:**

1. **First 5 Hours:** The power bank loses 9% of its charge per hour for 5 hours, so it loses 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge. 
2. **Remaining Charge:** The remaining charge after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%.
3. **Next 3 Hours:** The power bank loses 7% of its charge per hour for the next 3 hours, so it loses 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge.
4. **Remaining Charge:** The remaining charge after 8 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%.

**Final Calculation:**

We are given that the power bank has 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours.  We can use this information to solve for the initial charge.

"To determine the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save for a down payment, we need to consider her weekly earnings and the required savings. 

First, we need to calculate her total weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from wages and an additional $15 per hour from tips, resulting in a total of $25 per week.

Next, we need to determine her weekly savings.  She aims to save 20% of the car's cost, which is $10,000.  Therefore, her weekly savings are $10,000 * 0.20 = $2,000.

Finally, we can calculate the number of weeks she needs to work.  She needs to save $2,000 per week, and she earns $25 per week.  Therefore, she will need to work $2,000 / $25 = 80 weeks.


**Answer:** Janet will need to work for **80** weeks.

"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we need to consider the total cost of his current purchases and the remaining funds. 

First, we calculate the cost of the already purchased fruits: 3 peaches at $0.50 each, 4 pears at $0.50 each, 2 kiwis at $1.00 each, and 5 apples at $0.75 each. This totals $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Next, we subtract this cost from Jamaar's initial $10.00 to find his remaining funds: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75.

Finally, we divide the remaining funds by the price of a plum ($0.25) to determine the number of plums he can purchase: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3.

Therefore, Jamaar can purchase **3** plums.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.  

Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.  

The price of each large stuffed animal is 3 times the price of a small stuffed animal, which costs $4. Therefore, each large stuffed animal sells for 3 * $4 = $12.

The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.  The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.

The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120. Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.  Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.

Therefore, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.

"To determine the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes, we first need to consider the individual mining rates and then aggregate the output. 

* **Individual Mining Rate:** Each dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds per day (1.5 times the output of a dwarf with an iron pickaxe).
* **Total Daily Output:**  With 40 dwarves, the total daily output is 18 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 720 pounds.
* **Total Monthly Output:** Over a 30-day month, the total output is 720 pounds/day * 30 days = 21,600 pounds.


Therefore, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine **21,600** pounds of ore in a month.

"Let's analyze the situation.  Jim's income increases by a factor of three after completing his degree, which means his annual earnings are now $75,000.  

To determine the time it takes to recoup the loan payments and lost income, we need to consider the following:

* **Loan payments:** Jim incurs $50,000 in annual loan payments.
* **Lost income:**  He loses $25,000 per year in income while in school.
* **Total to recoup:**  He needs to earn $200,000 (loan payments) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.

To calculate the time required to earn this amount, we can use the following formula:

Time = Total to recoup / Annual earnings

Time = $300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years.

"To determine the fabric requirements, we first need to consider the dimensions of the fabric pieces relative to the bed.  The fabric pieces are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, which measures 6 feet by 8 feet.  

The area of the bed is calculated as 6 feet * 8 feet = 48 square feet.  

The fabric pieces are 8 feet by 10 feet, so their area is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Therefore, Jim needs to purchase two fabric pieces, each with an area of 80 square feet.  The total area of fabric required is 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Monday's delivery:**  The post office delivered 425 letters on Monday.
* **Tuesday's delivery:**  They delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's delivery, which is (1/5) * 425 = 85 letters.  Therefore, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday.
* **Wednesday's delivery:**  They delivered 5 more than twice the number delivered on Tuesday, which is 2 * 102 = 204 letters.  So, they delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters on Wednesday.
* **Total delivery:**  The total number of letters delivered is 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"To determine the total cost of Molly's catering, we need to calculate the cost of each dish separately and then sum the costs. 

* **Chicken Salad:** 10 individuals choose the chicken salad, and each person pays $6.50, resulting in a total cost of 10 * $6.50 = $65.00.
* **Pasta Salad:** 6 individuals choose the pasta salad, and each person pays $6, resulting in a total cost of 6 * $6 = $36.00.

Finally, we sum the costs of both dishes: $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00. 

Therefore, the total cost of the catering is $101.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let  'x' represent the amount the first person received.
    * The second person received x + $80.
    * The third person received 2(x + $80).

* **Formulate the equation:** The total amount divided by the number of people equals the share of each person:
    * (x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)) / 3 = $1920

* **Solve for x:**
    * Simplify the equation: (4x + $160) / 3 = $1920
    * Multiply both sides by 3: 4x + $160 = $5760
    * Subtract $160 from both sides: 4x = $5600
    * Divide both sides by 4: x = $1400

* **Determine the first person's share:** The first person received $1400.

"The total work time is determined by the total number of days worked and the work rate per day.  We are given that the team worked for 3/8th of a day each day for 3 weeks, which is equivalent to 63/8 days.  To convert this to hours, we multiply by 24 hours per day.  This gives us 189 hours.  Finally, we divide the total work time by the number of painters to find the work rate per painter, which is 47.25 hours.

"Let's analyze the problem systematically.  

Let 'x' represent the number of balls retrieved in the second set.  We are given that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than the second, meaning the first set had x + 4 balls.  Furthermore, the third set had half the number of balls retrieved in the second set, meaning the third set had x/2 balls.  The total number of balls retrieved across all three sets is 19.

We can express this mathematically as: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combining like terms, we get: (5/2)x + 4 = 19

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have: (5/2)x = 15

Multiplying both sides by 2/5, we find: x = 6.

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.  

The first set had x + 4 balls, so Rory retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

"The car's value depreciates exponentially.  We can model this with the formula:

**V(t) = V₀(1 - r)^t**

Where:

* V(t) is the value of the car at time t
* V₀ is the initial value of the car ($20,000)
* r is the depreciation rate (0.21 or 21%)
* t is the time elapsed in years (in this case, 2010 - 2007 = 3 years)

Plugging in the values:

V(3) = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3 
V(3) = 20000(0.79)^3
V(3) ≈ $9875

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 is approximately **$9875**.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Betsy and Donovan worked together to prepare a meal, and the total time taken was 98 minutes.  We are also told that Betsy's portion of the meal took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's portion.  

Let's denote Donovan's portion of the meal as 'x' minutes.  This means Betsy's portion took 'x + 18' minutes.  The total time for the meal is the sum of the times taken by both individuals.  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's portion of the meal took 40 minutes.  Betsy's portion took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The total cost of the party is $125 (base fee) + (41 guests * $6/guest) = $125 + $246 = $371.

"If each spring produces a new jellyfish every second, then in 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish would be the product of the number of jellyfish produced per second and the number of seconds in 4 hours.  

To calculate this, we need to consider the following:

* **Jellyfish per second:**  Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, the rate of jellyfish production is constant.
* **Time:** The time period is 4 hours, which is equal to 4 * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds.

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish produced is: 
(Jellyfish per second) * (Time in seconds) = (Jellyfish per second) * 14400 seconds.

"Jenny's savings can be determined by comparing the cost of buying bananas individually to the cost of buying them in bunches.  

**Cost of individual bananas:** 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

**Cost of buying bananas in bunches:** 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

The difference in cost is $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.  Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations.  

*  Let 'x' represent the length of fencing Sam has.
*  Harry has 'x + 60' feet of fencing.
*  The total length of fencing is 100 feet:  x + (x + 60) = 100

Solving for 'x', we get:
* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet of fencing.  

To find the amount left for Sam, we subtract Harry's fencing from the total: 100 - 80 = 20 feet.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Trekking Bikes:**  We know that half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so we have 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes sold.
* **BMX Bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, which is 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
* **MTB Bikes:**  The remaining bikes were MTB bikes, so we have 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes sold.
* **Revenue Calculation:**
    * MTB Revenue: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
    * BMX Revenue: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
    * Trekking Revenue: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

* **Total Revenue:**  The total revenue Marcel earned is $52,500 + $11,250 + $6,750 = $70,500. 


Therefore, Marcel earned $70,500 from selling bicycles during that month.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Class Time:** John has 2 extra classes, each 40 minutes long, totaling 80 minutes per day.  He attends these classes 5 days a week, so his total class time is 80 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 400 minutes/week.

* **Extra Learning:** John dedicates 1/16 of his weekly learning time to extra activities on Saturday and Sunday.  This translates to 480 minutes/week * (1/16) = 30 minutes/week.

* **Total Learning Time:**  The total time spent on learning is 400 minutes/week + 30 minutes/week = 430 minutes/week.

* **Conversion to Hours:**  430 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 7.17 hours/week. 


**Therefore, John spends approximately 7.17 hours per week learning.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Second child's height:** The second child's height is 2 inches greater than the first child's height, which is 6 feet.  This translates to 6 feet + 2 inches = 6 feet 2 inches.
* **Third child's height:** The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall.  Therefore, the third child is 6 feet 2 inches - 5 inches = 6 feet 7 inches tall.
* **Fourth child's height:** The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall.  This means the fourth child is 6 feet 7 inches + 3 inches = 6 feet 10 inches tall.
* **Conversion to inches:**  The fourth child's height is 6 feet 10 inches = 72 inches + 10 inches = 82 inches.

"Let's break down this problem logically.  We know the Allosaurus consumed the final 270 kilograms of meat.  This implies that the T-Rex consumed half of the remaining meat after the velociraptors had their share.  

To find the original amount of meat, we need to consider the following:

* **T-Rex's Consumption:** The Allosaurus consumed the remaining meat, which was half of what the T-Rex had eaten. 
* **Velociraptors' Consumption:** The velociraptors consumed half of the remaining meat after the T-Rex had eaten.

Therefore, we can deduce that the T-Rex ate half of the original amount of meat. 


**Answer:** 135 kilograms.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first need to calculate the total area of the walls.  The room has two pairs of walls, each with a length of 10 feet and a width of 8 feet.  Therefore, the area of the north and south walls is 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.  Similarly, the area of the east and west walls is 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.  The total area of the walls is 80 square feet + 40 square feet = 120 square feet.

Next, we need to determine the number of gallons of paint required to cover this area.  Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet.  Therefore, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon: 120 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 6 gallons.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the paint.  Each gallon of paint costs $12.  Therefore, the total cost is 6 gallons * $12/gallon = $72.

"The key to solving this problem is understanding that the trains are moving in opposite directions, meaning their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.  

Let's denote the speed of the faster train as 'x' and the speed of the slower train as 'y'.  We know that the faster train travels at 'x' miles per hour and the slower train travels at 'y' miles per hour.  

The distance traveled by the faster train in 3 hours is 3x miles.  The distance traveled by the slower train in 3 hours is 3y miles.  

The total distance between the trains after 3 hours is the sum of the distances traveled by each train.  

Therefore, the total distance is 3x + 3y.  

We are given that the faster train travels at 60 miles per hour and the slower train travels at half that speed, so we can substitute these values into the equation above.  

The total distance is 3(60) + 3(30) = 180 + 90 = 270 miles. 


**Answer:** 270 miles

"To determine the total number of people inside the church, we need to consider the number of individuals transported by buses and cars.  

* **Buses:** Each bus carries 35 passengers, and there are 12 buses, so the total number of passengers from buses is 12 * 35 = 420.
* **Cars:** Each car carries 3 passengers, and there are 20 cars, so the total number of passengers from cars is 20 * 3 = 60.
* **Total:**  The total number of people inside the church is 420 + 60 = 480. 


Therefore, there were **480** people inside the church.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total distance:** The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles.
* **Amber's distance:** Amber ran 8 miles.
* **Micah's distance:** Micah ran 3.5 times Amber's distance, meaning he ran 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.
* **Combined distance of Amber and Micah:**  Together, they ran 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.
* **Ahito's distance:**  To find Ahito's distance, we subtract the combined distance of Amber and Micah from the total distance: 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.


**Answer:** Ahito ran 16 miles.

"Let's analyze Sheila's credit card transaction.  

First, we need to consider the initial charge of $85.00.  Subsequently, she returns an item for a credit of $15.00.  This leaves a balance of $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

Next, we need to account for the sale on the frying pan.  The discount is calculated as 20% of $20.00, which is $4.00.  The sale price of the frying pan is then $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

Finally, we need to consider the discount on the towels.  The discount is calculated as 10% of $30.00, which is $3.00.  The final price of the towels is then $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

The total cost of the new purchases is $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.  

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Large jellyfish:** We know that a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, and 6 jellyfish changed color. This means that 6 represents 1/3 of the total number of large jellyfish.
* **Total large jellyfish:**  Let 'x' represent the total number of large jellyfish.  We can set up an equation: (1/3) * x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 18.
* **Total jellyfish:** Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and there are 18 large jellyfish, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 18 * 5 = 90.

"Let's break down this problem to understand the financial implications of Lauren's retirement savings plan. 

First, we need to determine the total amount Lauren needs to accumulate for her retirement.  We know she's saving 20% of her annual income, and she's aiming for a 20-year retirement.  

To calculate the total savings needed, we can use the following formula:

**Total Savings = Annual Savings * Number of Years**

In this case, her annual savings are $60,000 (after accounting for living expenses), and she's saving for 20 years.  Therefore, the total savings needed is:

**Total Savings = $60,000 * 20 = $1,200,000**

Now, we need to determine how many years Lauren needs to work to accumulate this amount.  

**Answer:**  Lauren needs to work for 20 years to reach her savings goal.

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we can utilize the concept of proportions.  

Since 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the total number of students in the school.
*  We know 40/100 = 240/x 

Cross-multiplying, we get: 40x = 240 * 100
Simplifying, we have: 40x = 24000
Solving for x, we find: x = 24000 / 40 = 600 students.

The total number of students is 600.  Therefore, the number of girls is: 600 - 240 = 360.

"To determine the amount of apples James has left, we first need to calculate the total amount of apples Peter and Paul take.  

* Peter's share is 1/4 of the total, which is (1/4) * 12 kg = 3 kg.
* Paul's share is 1/3 of the total, which is (1/3) * 12 kg = 4 kg.

Therefore, together they take 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg of apples.

Finally, we subtract this amount from the initial total to find James' share: 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.

**Answer:** 5 kg

"To determine the time required for the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we can utilize the concept of a constant rate of blinking. 

The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, which means it blinks at a rate of 255 blinks per 5 minutes.  

To find the time required to blink 459 times, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the time in minutes.
*  We know the rate of blinking is constant: 255 blinks / 5 minutes = x blinks / x minutes

Solving for x:

*  255 / 5 = x / x
*  51 = 1
*  Therefore, x = 51 minutes. 


**Answer:** The light will take **51 minutes** to blink 459 times.

* **Goldfish:** Tate starts with 3 male and 5 female goldfish, totaling 8 goldfish. He then purchases 2 male and 3 female goldfish, bringing the total to 13 goldfish.

The difference in the number of female fishes and male fishes is 14 female guppies - 14 male guppies = 0.  The difference in the number of female goldfish and male goldfish is 13 female goldfish - 13 male goldfish = 0.

"The problem presents a classic work-rate scenario.  We can solve this by considering the total production of the first four workers and then calculating the production of the fifth worker. 

* The first two workers produce a combined 12 toys per hour. 
* The total production of the first four workers is 120 toys.
* The remaining 20 toys needed to complete the order are not produced by the first four workers. 
* Therefore, the fifth worker must produce 260 toys - 140 toys = 120 toys.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.  We are also told that Elijah has two dogs, one that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog and another that is half the weight of Kory's dog. 

To find the total weight of both dogs, we need to calculate the weight of each of Elijah's dogs and then add them together.

* **First dog:**  One-fourth the weight of Kory's dog is (1/4) * 60 pounds = 15 pounds.
* **Second dog:** Half the weight of Kory's dog is (1/2) * 60 pounds = 30 pounds.

Finally, the total weight of both dogs is 15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.  We are given a series of transactions involving stickers, and we need to determine the initial number of stickers Seth had. 

* **Kris's stickers:** Kris received 7 stickers from Rob, and kept 9, meaning he had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers.
* **Luis's stickers:**  Luis used half of Seth's stickers, and Kris had 16 stickers, so Seth had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.
* **Seth's starting stickers:**  We know that Seth gave Luis half his stickers, so he had 32 / 2 = 16 stickers.


Therefore, Seth had **16** stickers in the beginning.

"To determine the number of days it takes Alfie to fly half the circumference of the Earth, we need to consider the following:

* **Circumference:** The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 kilometers.
* **Alfie's daily distance:** Alfie flies 400 kilometers per day.

To find the number of days to cover half the circumference, we can calculate:

* **Half the circumference:** 40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers
* **Days to cover half the circumference:** 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie **50 days** to fly half the circumference of the Earth.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago.  This means we can set up an equation:

* Let Vince's current age be represented by the variable 'v'.
* Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.
* We know Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age two years ago, so we can write the equation: 14 = 2v

Solving for 'v' (Vince's current age):

* 14 = 2v
* v = 14 / 2
* v = 7

Therefore, Vince is currently 7 years old.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.  

We are given that a total of 56 eggs were painted by four individuals.  We can represent the number of eggs painted by each person with the following variables:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of eggs painted by Sarah.
*  Let 'z' represent the number of eggs painted by Camden.

We are given the following information:

*  Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so x + x = 2x
*  Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This translates to y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12.
*  The total number of eggs painted is 2x + (2y + 12) = 56.

We can now solve for the unknowns.

**Solving for y:**

From the second equation, we can simplify:
* 2y + 12 = 30
* 2y = 18
* y = 9

**Solving for x:**

We know that x + x = 2x, and we also know that y = 9.  Substituting y = 9 into the equation, we get:
* x + x = 2x
* 2x = 2x
* 2x = 2x

**Solving for z:**

We know that Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so z = y + 12.  Substituting y = 9, we get:
* z = 9 + 12
* z = 21

**Finding the Difference:**

Finally, we can find the difference between Camden's and Arnold's eggs:
* z - x = 21 - 11 = 10

**Answer:**  Camden painted 10 more eggs than Arnold.

"The total weight of the crayons and boxes is determined by the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes.  

* **Crayons:** 200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces
* **Boxes:** 25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

The total weight is 200 ounces + 200 ounces = 400 ounces. 

Finally, convert the total weight from ounces to pounds: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds. 


**Answer:** 25 pounds

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Log Yield:** John's tree yields 64 feet of usable logs, representing 80% of the total tree's length.
* **Log Quantity:**  He cuts the logs into 4-foot pieces, resulting in 64 feet / 4 feet/log = 16 logs.
* **Plank Production:** Each log yields 5 planks, so he produces 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks.
* **Revenue:** He sells each plank for $1.2, and he has 80 planks, so his total earnings are 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96.00.


Therefore, John makes $96.00 from selling the planks.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Valerie's income:**  We know Valerie earns $5000 per month.
* **Brother's income:**  Her brother earns twice Valerie's income, so he earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.
* **Combined income:** Their combined monthly income is $5000 + $10000 = $15000.
* **Mother's income:** The mother's income is double their combined income, meaning she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.
* **Total income:**  The total amount of money they have together is $15000 + $30000 = $45000.


Therefore, the total amount of money they have together is $45000.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 

* **Beach walking:** Grandma walks 2 miles at a speed of 3 miles per day / 2 miles = 1.5 miles per hour.
* **Sidewalk walking:** She walks 1 mile at twice the speed of the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is 1.5 miles per hour * 2 = 3 miles per hour.
* **Total time:**  The total time for the entire walk is 3 miles + 1 mile = 4 miles.
* **Time per mile:**  The time to walk 4 miles is 4 miles / 3 miles per hour = 1.33 hours.
* **Total time:**  The total time for the entire walk is 1.33 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 80 minutes.

"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to consider the consumption pattern over the two 30-day periods. 

First, we calculate the total eggs consumed in the first 30 days: 3 eggs/day * 30 days = 90 eggs.

Then, we calculate the total eggs consumed in the second 30 days: 5 eggs/day * 30 days = 150 eggs.

Finally, we sum the total eggs consumed: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find the number of dozens needed for 60 days, we divide the total eggs consumed by the number of eggs per dozen: 240 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 20 dozens.

Therefore, Chester will need **20** dozens of eggs for 60 days.

"To determine the number of days Lauren needs to complete the project, we can analyze the number of scenes she can produce per day and the total number of scenes required. 

* **Large scenes:** 45 scenes / 5 scenes/day = 9 days
* **Medium scenes:** 36 scenes / 6 scenes/day = 6 days
* **Small scenes:** 49 scenes / 7 scenes/day = 7 days

The total number of days required to complete the project is the sum of the days needed for each size: 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days.

"To determine Sid's average speed, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken.  

First, we calculate the average speed for the first leg of the trip, which is 55 miles per hour.  

Next, we calculate the average speed for the second leg of the trip, which is 46.67 miles per hour. 

Finally, we can calculate the average speed for the entire journey by considering the total distance and total time. 

The average speed is calculated as:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

Average Speed = (110 miles + 140 miles) / (2 hours + 3 hours)

Average Speed = 250 miles / 5 hours

Average Speed = 50 miles per hour.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.  

* **Define variables:** Let's use the variables C, J, and C to represent the number of seashells Carlos, Jim, and Carrey collected, respectively.

* **Set up equations:** We know the following:
    * J = C + 5 (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
    * C = 2J (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)

* **Solve for C:**  Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
    * C = 2(C + 5)
    * C = 2C + 10
    * -C = 10
    * C = -10. This result is not possible as we cannot have a negative number of seashells. 

* **Re-evaluate the problem:** There seems to be an error in the given information. It's impossible for Carlos to have collected 22 seashells if Jim collected 27.

"To determine the number of additional bottles Hortex needs to produce, we first need to understand the relationship between the daily energy demand and the number of bottles produced. 

Each bottle of Hortex carrot juice provides 20% of a person's daily energy requirement.  We need to calculate the total energy requirement for 2300 people. 

* **Total energy demand:** 2300 people * 0.20 (energy per person) = 460 units of energy.

To satisfy this demand, Hortex needs to produce enough bottles to provide 460 units of energy. 

* **Bottles needed:** 460 units of energy / 0.20 (energy per bottle) = 2300 bottles.

Since Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles, they need to produce 2300 - 4200 = -1900 more bottles.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Apartment Complexes:** John collects from three apartment complexes.
* **Complex 1 & 2:** Each has 200 apartments.
* **Complex 3:**  This complex is 60% larger than the combined number of apartments in complexes 1 and 2.  
* **Collection Frequency:** John collects garbage 3 times per week from each complex.
* **Payment:** He earns $0.40 per apartment collected.

**Calculating Total Apartments:**

* Complex 1 & 2: 200 apartments * 2 complexes = 400 apartments
* Complex 3: 400 apartments * 0.60 = 240 apartments
* Total Apartments: 400 apartments + 240 apartments = 640 apartments

**Calculating Weekly Earnings:**

* Weekly earnings = (Total apartments collected) * (Price per apartment)
* Weekly earnings = 640 apartments * $0.40/apartment = $256.00


**Therefore, John makes $256.00 per week.**

"Let's break down the avocado tree's fruit production over its lifespan. 

* **Year 1-5:** The tree produces 50 fruits per year for 5 years, resulting in a total of 50 * 5 = 250 fruits.
* **Year 6:** The tree's production increases to 3 times the initial amount, so it produces 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
* **Year 7:** The production increases again, this time by 7 times the initial amount, resulting in 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.
* **Year 8:** The production is 200 less than the 10-year-old tree, meaning it produces 350 - 200 = 150 fruits.
* **Year 9:** The tree does not produce any fruit.
* **Year 10:** The tree produces 20 times the initial amount, resulting in 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.

Adding up the total fruit production over the 10 years, we get 250 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = **2250 fruits**.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  

* **Define variables:** Let  'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.  Since the blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, we can represent its length as 'y - 7'.  The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so its length is '4(y - 7)'.

* **Formulate the equation:** The total length of the three ropes is 37 cm, so we can write the equation: y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

* **Solve the equation:**
    1. Combine like terms: 6y - 28 = 37
    2. Add 28 to both sides: 6y = 65
    3. Divide both sides by 6: y = 10.83 (approximately)

* **Determine the length of the red rope:**  The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so we can substitute the value of 'y' to find its length: 4(10.83 - 7) = 4 * 3.83 = 15.32 (approximately)

**Answer:** The length of the red rope is approximately 15.32 cm.

* **Rissa's remaining amount:**  After giving away $3, Rissa has $15 - $3 = $12 left.
* **Ronnie's initial amount:**  Ronnie had $5.
* **Ronnie's contribution:**  Ronnie also gave away $3.
* **Ronnie's remaining amount:**  After giving away $3, Ronnie has $5 - $3 = $2 left.


Therefore, Ronnie has $2 left.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.  The total amount of paint is 12 pints.  We are given that half the mural is yellow, which means the yellow paint represents 6 pints.  Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can find the amount of each color by dividing the total amount of paint by 4.  This gives us 12 pints / 4 = 3 pints per color.  Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 3 pints.

"The total area of the house can be determined by considering the area of the bedrooms and the living room, and then adding the area of the remaining space.  

* **Bedrooms:** Each bedroom has an area of 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.  Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet.
* **Living Room:** The living room is 5 times larger than a bedroom, so its area is 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.
* **Remaining Space:** The remaining space in the house is 1000 square feet.
* **Total Area:** The total area of the house is the sum of the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining space: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Let's break down the problem. Alice's cloud count follows a geometric sequence.  

* **Monday:** 3 puffs
* **Tuesday:** 3 * 2 = 6 puffs
* **Wednesday:** 6 * 2 = 12 puffs
* **Thursday:** 12 * 2 = 24 puffs
* **Friday:** 24 * 2 = 48 puffs

The sum of this geometric sequence is found using the formula:

S = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Where:
* S = the sum of the sequence
* a = the first term (3 puffs)
* r = the common ratio (2)
* n = the number of terms (5)

Plugging in the values:

S = 3 (1 - 2^5) / (1 - 2)
S = 3 (1 - 32) / (-1)
S = 3 (-31) / (-1)
S = 93

Therefore, Alice will have counted a total of 93 puffs across all five days.

"The teacher's chalk usage pattern is a classic example of a fractional representation of a continuous process.  We can model this with a simple equation:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of days the teacher can use the chalk.**
* **The teacher uses 20% of the chalk per day, so the amount of chalk used in 'x' days is 0.20x.**
* **The teacher uses 45% of the chalk on Monday, which is 0.45x.**
* **We know that the teacher uses 2.25 times the amount of chalk on Monday compared to his usual usage, so we can set up the equation:** 0.45x = 2.25 * 0.20x
* **Solving for x, we get:** 0.45x = 0.45x
* **This equation is true for any value of x, meaning the teacher can use the chalk indefinitely.**


**Answer:** The teacher can use the chalk indefinitely.

"Let's break down the problem.  Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of masks Mike bought.  

*  Let's represent Mike's masks as 'm'.
*  Thrice the number of masks Mike bought is 3m.
*  Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of masks Mike bought, so he bought 3m + 2 masks.

Therefore, Johnny bought 3m + 2 masks.  We know that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice the number of masks Mike bought, so we can set up an equation:

3m + 2 = 17

Now, solve for 'm':

* 3m = 15
* m = 5

Since Mike bought 5 masks, Johnny bought 3 * 5 + 2 = 17 masks.


**Answer:** Johnny bought 17 face masks.

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth fixed, we first need to calculate the total number of teeth that the dentist worked on. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more, resulting in a total of 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.  

The percentage of James' teeth fixed is then calculated as the number of teeth fixed (11) divided by the total number of teeth (30), multiplied by 100%. This gives us (11/30) * 100% = 36.67%. 

Therefore, the dentist fixed 36.67% of James' teeth.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let Colin's current age be represented by 'C' and Wendy's current age by 'W'.  We are given two key pieces of information:

* **Statement 1:**  W = 5(C + 7)  
* **Statement 2:** C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25)

**Solving for 'C'**

We can solve for 'C' by substituting the value of 'W' from Statement 1 into Statement 2:

1. **Substitute:**  C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)
2. **Simplify:** C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
3. **Continue simplifying:** C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
4. **Distribute:** C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
5. **Isolate 'C':** (2/3)C = 5
6. **Solve for 'C':** C = 25/2

**Answer:** Colin is currently 12.5 years old.

"To determine the number of books Bob can buy per school, we need to consider the total budget and the cost per book.  

We know Bob has $27,000 to distribute among three schools.  This means each school receives $27,000 / 3 = $9,000.

Each school can purchase 100 books for $500.  Therefore, the number of books a school can purchase is $500 / $9,000 = 0.56 books per $100.

To find the number of books per school, we multiply the number of books per $100 by the total budget per school: 0.56 books per $100 * $9,000 = 504 books.


**Answer:** Bob can buy 504 books per school.

"To determine the time it takes Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds and melts snowballs. 

First, we need to determine the net change in his snowball count per minute.  He builds 1/3 snowball per minute, and melts 2/15 snowballs per minute.  

To find the net change, we subtract the melting rate from the building rate: 1/3 - 2/15 = 1/15 snowball per minute.

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to reach 60 snowballs.  We can do this by using the following equation:

Time = (Total Snowballs) / (Net Change per Minute)

Time = 60 / (1/15) = 900 minutes. 



**Answer:** 900 minutes

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that John's age 20 years ago was 8 years old, and we need to find Jim's age 20 years ago.  

Since John was twice as old as Jim, we can set up an equation:

* John's age 20 years ago = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

We know John's age 20 years ago was 8, so we can substitute that into the equation:

* 8 = 2 * Jim's age 20 years ago

To find Jim's age 20 years ago, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

* 8 / 2 = Jim's age 20 years ago

Therefore, Jim's age 20 years ago was 4. 



**Answer:** Jim was 4 years old.

**Therefore, the total number of individuals who entered the restaurant is 470.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Red pens:** Alain's mom purchased 5 packs of red pens.
* **Black pens:**  The number of black pens is double the number of red pens, so Alain's mom bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.
* **Total pens:**  The total number of pens is the sum of the red and black pens: 5 * 5 + 10 * 5 = 25 + 50 = 75 pens.

Therefore, Alain has 75 pens. 


**Answer:** 75

"Let's break down the problem. John purchases 10 bottles of scotch at a cost of $600.  To determine the cost of his cognac purchase, we need to consider the price per bottle and the quantity. 

First, we need to determine the price per bottle of cognac.  We know that cognac costs 50% more than scotch, meaning it costs 1.50 times the price of a scotch bottle.  

Next, we need to determine the number of cognac bottles John purchases.  He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

Finally, we can calculate the total cost of the cognac.  The total cost is 20 bottles * $15/bottle = $300.

Therefore, the total cost of John's purchase is $600 (scotch) + $300 (cognac) = $900.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Day 1:** Mr. Julius plants 20 White Oak trees and twice that number of Lodgepole Pine, resulting in a total of 20 + (20 * 2) = 60 trees.
* **Day 2:** He plants 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on day 1. This means he plants 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees and 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees, totaling 30 + 10 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.
* **Total Trees:**  The total number of trees planted in two days is 60 + 40 = 100 trees.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Stock:** Fred begins with 24 gallons of root beer.

2. **Children's Consumption:** His children consume 4 gallons, leaving 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

3. **Barbie's Spill:** Barbie spills 7 gallons, reducing the remaining stock to 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

4. **Ronnie's Consumption:** Ronnie takes 5 gallons, leaving 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

5. **Party Consumption:**  With 3 people attending the party, each person receives 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons of root beer.


**Answer:** 2.67 gallons

"Let's express this problem algebraically.  We are given the statement: ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40.""  This translates to the equation:

4 * x + 8 = 40

Where 'x' represents the unknown number of coffee mugs.  

Solving for 'x', we can follow these steps:

1. **Simplify:** 4x + 8 = 40
2. **Isolate the x term:** Subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 32
3. **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 4: x = 8

Therefore, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Red Stripe Fish:**  We know one-third of the fish have red stripes, so we can calculate this as (1/3) * 66 fish = 22 fish.
* **Remaining Fish:**  The remaining fish are those that don't have red stripes, which is 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish.
* **Blue Stripe Fish:**  5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so we can calculate this as (5/11) * 44 fish = 20 fish.
* **Total:**  To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of red stripe fish and the number of blue stripe fish: 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish.

"The height of the roof is determined by the height of the second floor minus the height of the first floor.  

The height of the first floor is three times the height of Mattison, who is 60 inches tall.  Therefore, the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches high.

The second floor is seven times the height of Mattison, who is 60 inches tall.  Therefore, the second floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches high.

The height of the roof is the difference between the second floor and the first floor.  Therefore, the roof is 420 - 180 = 240 inches high.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Step 1: Calculate the shells found by Alphas.**  We know Alphas found 40% of the total shells, which is 700 * 0.40 = 280 shells.

* **Step 2: Calculate the shells remaining after Alphas's contribution.**  We subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total number of shells: 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

* **Step 3: Calculate the shells found by The Finders.** The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 420 * 0.60 = 252 shells.

* **Step 4: Calculate the shells found by Gogetters.**  The remaining shells are 420 - 252 = 168 shells.  Therefore, Gogetters found 168 shells. 


**Answer:** Team Gogetters found 168 shells.

"To determine the required daily exercise for the last dog, we can utilize the concept of average.  The total distance the three dogs need to walk is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.  Since the average distance per dog is 3 miles, we can calculate the distance the last dog needs to walk by subtracting the total distance needed by the other dogs from the total distance: 8 - 3 = 5 miles.

"John's mortgage loan is calculated as 40% of his home's value, which is $250,000. This results in a loan of $100,000.  He then utilizes 60% of this loan to settle his existing debts.  Subtracting the amount used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount, we find that John has $40,000 remaining. 


**Answer:** $40,000

"Deandre's earnings can be calculated by first determining the total weight of the tunas he caught.  The total weight is 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.  Next, we can calculate his earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram, which is $0.50.  Therefore, Deandre will earn 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00. 


**Answer:** $64.00

"Trinity's profit is calculated as follows:

* **Selling Price:** She sells the magazines at 11/8 of the original price, which is equivalent to (11/8) * $72 = $99.
* **Profit:** The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. Therefore, her profit is $99 - $72 = $27.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the total water removal.

* **Low setting:** The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day. Over 3 days, it removes 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.
* **Medium setting:** The medium setting removes twice the amount of the low setting, so it removes 1 liter/day * 2 = 2 liters/day. Over 3 days, it removes 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.
* **High setting:** The high setting removes twice the amount of the medium setting, so it removes 2 liters/day * 2 = 4 liters/day. Over 5 days, it removes 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Finally, we sum the water removed from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = **30 liters**. 


Therefore, the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier is 30 liters.

"Let's break down the problem. Jolene and her friends started with 300 balloons across 10 packs.  After the fight, 12 balloons remained.  To find the total number of balloons thrown, we need to consider the initial number and the remaining balloons.  

The total number of balloons thrown is the initial number minus the remaining balloons.  

Therefore, the total number of balloons thrown is 300 - 12 = 288. 


**Answer:** 288

"To determine the total volume of medicine in 8 doses, we need to consider the dosage of each component.  

* The first medicine requires 14 mL.
* The second medicine requires 3 times that amount, so it requires 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.
* The total volume per dose is the sum of the two components: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.
* To find the total volume for 8 doses, we multiply the dose volume by the number of doses: 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.


Therefore, the total volume of medicine in 8 doses is **448 mL**.

"The capacity of John's classes is determined by the number of students each class can hold, which is 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class.  Therefore, each of John's classes has a capacity of 15 students.  The combined capacity of both schools is the sum of the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes.  The total capacity is 120 students + 30 students = 150 students.

"Let's break down the problem to determine the error in Tim's estimation.

**1. Volume of the Jar:**

* The jar is a square with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.  
* The volume of a rectangular prism is calculated as length * width * height.
* Therefore, the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.

**2. Volume of Jelly Beans:**

* The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning that 80% of the space within the jar is actually occupied by jelly beans.
* The volume of jelly beans is calculated as the volume of the jar multiplied by the packing efficiency.
* Volume of jelly beans = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

**3. Number of Jelly Beans:**

* The number of jelly beans is determined by dividing the volume of jelly beans by the volume per jelly bean.
* The volume per jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.
* Number of jelly beans = 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

**4. Error in Estimation:**

* The difference between Tim's estimated number of jelly beans (2880) and the actual number (900) is 2880 - 900 = 1980. 

**Answer:** Tim's estimate was 1980 jelly beans off.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Passengers:** The bus starts with 20 passengers.

2. **First Stop:** 40 passengers enter the bus. The total number of passengers after the first stop is 20 + 40 = 60.

3. **Second Stop:**  3/4 of the passengers from the first stop (60) enter the bus, resulting in 60 * (3/4) = 45 passengers. The total number of passengers after the second stop is 60 + 45 = 105.

4. **Third Stop:** The bus's capacity is doubled, meaning the number of passengers increases to 105 * 2 = 210.

5. **Remaining Passengers:**  To find the number of passengers needed to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract the current number of passengers from the bus's capacity: 210 - 180 = 30.

"The total number of students participating in the escape room is 40.  Since each group consists of 8 students, there are 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.  Each group has a 45-minute time limit.  Therefore, the total time required for all groups to complete the escape room is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes. 


**Answer:** 225 minutes

"To determine the total cost, we need to consider the cost of the tables and the roof frames separately.  

* **Tables:** John manufactured 4 tables at a price of $20 each, resulting in a cost of 4 * $20 = $80.
* **Roof Frames:** He also manufactured 2 roof frames at a price of $10 each, resulting in a cost of 2 * $10 = $20.

Therefore, the total cost for Ali is $80 + $20 = $100. 


**Answer:** $100

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, and we need to find the length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.  

Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.  The longer piece is then 4x.  We can set up an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get:

5x = 40

Dividing both sides by 5, we find:

x = 8

Therefore, the shorter piece is 8 feet long.  The longer piece is 4 times that length, so it is 4 * 8 = 32 feet long. 


**Answer: 32**

"To determine the amount of seasoning needed, we first need to determine the total amount of beef required.  We know that Aiden produces 16 meatballs per pound of beef.  Therefore, to make 80 meatballs, he needs to use 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of beef.  

Next, we need to calculate the amount of seasoning needed.  Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of beef, he will need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning. 


**Answer:** 10

"Luke needs to purchase fabric for five windows, each measuring 35 inches wide.  The total width of the windows is 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.  To ensure adequate coverage, Luke should purchase fabric that is twice the total window width, which is 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches.  Therefore, he should buy 350 inches of fabric.

"The cost of the call can be broken down as follows:

* The initial 16 minutes cost $0.25 per minute, resulting in a cost of 16 * $0.25 = $4.00.
* The remaining 20 minutes cost $0.20 per minute, resulting in a cost of 20 * $0.20 = $4.00.
* The total cost is the sum of these two components, giving us $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00. 


Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00. 
"
"Let's break down the problem.  The rainfall on Tuesday is determined by the following:

* Monday's rainfall: 2 inches
* Tuesday's rainfall is 1 inch more than twice Monday's rainfall.

Therefore, Tuesday's rainfall is 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 inches. 

**Answer:** 5 inches

"Let's analyze the problem. We are given that Carly makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes she makes in terms of brownies.  This translates to the following equation:

*  b = 3c - 2

We also know that the total number of treats for the class is 10.  Since each person receives 2 treats, we can express this as:

* 5 * 2 = 10

To find the number of cupcakes, we need to find the value of 'c' that satisfies the equation:

* b + c = 10

Substituting the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* (3c - 2) + c = 10

Simplifying and solving for 'c':

* 4c - 2 = 10
* 4c = 12
* c = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes. 


**Answer:** 3

"Karen's total cost will be the price of the manicure and pedicure after the discount, plus the cost of the nail art.  

The discount on the manicure and pedicure is calculated as follows: $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) * 0.20 (20%) = $35 + $8 = $43.  

The cost of nail art is $3 per nail, and Karen has 10 nails, so the total cost of nail art is $3 * 10 = $30.

Therefore, the total cost for Karen is $43 (discounted price) + $30 (nail art) = $73.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total issues from the 12-issue magazines:** 3 magazines * 12 issues/magazine = 36 issues
* **Total issues from the 6-issue magazine:** 1 magazine * 6 issues/magazine = 6 issues
* **Total issues from the 4-issue magazine:** 1 magazine * 24 issues/magazine = 24 issues
* **Total issues received:** 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 issues per year.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  We are given that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.  We are also given that Samantha has 27 paintings.  

Let's denote Kim's number of paintings as 'x'.  We can express Shelley's number of paintings as 'x + 8', and Samantha's number of paintings as 'x - 4'.  

We can now set up an equation based on the given information:

x - 4 = 27

Solving for x, we get:

x = 31

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

Therefore, the mean score for Sally's math quizzes is:

**Mean = (50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60) / 9 = 63.33**

"Let's break down the problem. Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  We are told this represents 3/4 of her novels this year.  To find the total number of novels she wrote this year, we can set up a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of novels Regina wrote this year.

The proportion is: 9/1 = 3/4 * x

Solving for x:

* Multiply both sides by 4/3: (9/1) * (4/3) = x
* Simplify: 12 = x

Therefore, Regina wrote **12** novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas covered by Michael, we first need to calculate the total distance traveled in kilometers.  

Since Michael travels at a constant speed of 50 km/hr for 3 days, we can calculate the total distance traveled as follows:

* **Daily distance:** 50 km/hr * 24 hr = 1200 km
* **Total distance:** 1200 km/day * 3 days = 3600 km

Now, we can express the percentage of the distance covered as a fraction of the total distance:

* **Percentage:** (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100% = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Initial grapes:** Madeline starts with 6 grapes.
* **Brother's contribution:** Her brother uses 5 times the number Madeline ate, so he uses 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
* **Total used:** Together, they use 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
* **Remaining grapes:**  The problem states they have 0 grapes left after the juice and pies. 
* **Pies:** The mother uses 0 grapes for the pies.

"Bud's weekly macaroni and cheese expenditure can be broken down as follows:

* **Pasta:** $1.00 per box
* **Cheddar Cheese:** $3.00
* **Gruyere Cheese:** $3.00 * 2 = $6.00
* **Total Cheese Cost:** $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00

To calculate his annual expenditure, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year:

* **Annual Cheese Cost:** $9.00/week * 52 weeks/year = $468.00

Therefore, Bud spends $468.00 annually on making macaroni and cheese.

"To determine the number of bookcases required, we need to consider the capacity of each shelf and the total number of books Elly possesses. 

* **Bottom shelf:** Holds twice the capacity of a middle shelf, meaning it can accommodate 20 books.
* **Top shelf:** Holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, with a capacity of 15 books.
* **Middle shelves:**  Each middle shelf holds 10 books.

The total capacity of all shelves is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

To determine the number of bookcases needed, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of each shelf: 110 books / 55 books/case = 2 bookcases.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Red hats:**  We know Skyler has 100 hats and half are red, so there are 100 / 2 = 50 red hats.
* **Remaining hats:**  This leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats that are not red.
* **Blue hats:**  3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, which is (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.
* **White hats:**  The remaining hats are the ones that are white, so there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.

**Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.**

"The cost per stick of jerky is determined by dividing the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks.  

The original price of the bag is $18.00, and the bag contains 30 sticks.  Therefore, the cost per stick is $18.00 / 30 sticks = $0.60 per stick.

To express this cost in cents, we multiply by 100: $0.60 * 100 cents/dollar = 60 cents. 


**Answer:** 60 cents

"To determine the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test, we need to consider the total number of questions and the percentage of correct answers required for passing. 

First, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to answer correctly to pass.  Since she needs to achieve a 70% success rate on both tests, we can express this as a proportion:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test.

*  The total number of questions she needs to answer correctly is 70% of 70 + 70% of 40 = 0.70 * 70 + 0.70 * 40 = 49 + 28 = 77 questions.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes, and these are composed of strawberry and blueberry cubes.  We are told that the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  

Let's represent the number of strawberry cubes with the variable 'x'.  The number of blueberry cubes can then be represented as 5x - 4.  The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, so we can set up an equation:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combining like terms, we get:

6x - 4 = 116

Adding 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Dividing both sides by 6:

x = 20

Therefore, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is then:

5 * 20 - 4 = 96

**Answer: 96**

"To calculate the total points scored, we need to consider the number of games played and the points scored per game.  

* **Games played:** Ara played 40 games per year for four years.
* **Points per game:** She scored 21 points per game.

Therefore, the total points scored is:

Total points = (Games played per year) * (Points per game) * (Number of years)

Total points = (40 games/year * 21 points/game * 4 years) = 3360 points

"Let's break down the problem:

* Brendan begins with 10 marbles.
* He drops half, leaving him with 10 / 2 = 5 marbles.
* He finds 3 more, increasing his total to 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
* Finally, he removes one marble, leaving him with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, Brendan ends up with **7** marbles.

"To determine the number of calls Jason needs to make, we need to consider the conversion rate from calls to customers and the conversion rate from customers to sales. 

Let's break down the problem:

* **Conversion Rate:** Jason gets one customer for every 25 calls. This means he needs to make 15 cars / 1 customer/25 calls = 375 calls to convert 15 customers. 

* **Sales Conversion:** For every 2 customers who visit the dealership, one customer buys a car.  

Therefore, Jason needs to make 15 cars / 2 customers/car = 7.5 customers. 

To find the total number of calls, we need to consider the conversion rate from calls to customers and the conversion rate from customers to sales. 

**Answer:** Jason needs to make 188 calls.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Flashlights:**  The family has a total of 4 flashlights.
* **Candles:**  
    *  Half the rooms (4 rooms / 2 = 2 rooms) have 4 small candles each, totaling 2 rooms * 4 candles/room = 8 small candles.
    * The other half (4 rooms / 2 = 2 rooms) have 5 medium candles each, totaling 2 rooms * 5 candles/room = 10 medium candles.
    * Total candles: 8 small candles + 10 medium candles = 18 candles.
* **Total:** The family has 4 flashlights + 18 candles = 22 items in total.

Therefore, the family is using 22 items when the lights go out.

"Tim handles 6 hours of phone calls per day, each call taking 15 minutes to resolve.  To determine the total number of calls he addresses over a 5-day work week, we first need to calculate his daily call volume.  

Since he works 6 hours, and each call takes 15 minutes, he makes 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour / 15 minutes/call = 240 calls per day.

Over a 5-day work week, he handles 240 calls/day * 5 days/week = 1200 calls.

* **Quarter-cup plants:** 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants
* **Total water needed:** 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day.

"Let's break down the problem.  We are given that the cost of the main phone is twice the cost of each additional phone.  We are also given that the total cost of the plan is $20.  

To find the cost of the additional phones, we can use the information that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.  Therefore, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10.

The total cost of the additional phones is then 4 * $10 = $40.

Finally, the total cost of the plan is $20 + $40 = $60.

"To determine the number of days Jade needs to upload her photos, we can calculate the total number of photos she uploads per day and then divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per batch. 

She uploads 7 photos per batch and uploads 6 batches per day, so she uploads 7 * 6 = 42 photos per day. 

To find the number of days to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day: 210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days. 


Therefore, Jade will need **5 days** to upload all her photos.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Day 1:**  Conor observes 50 people.
* **Day 2:** The number of people increases by 20 from Day 1, resulting in 50 + 20 = 70 people.
* **Day 3:** The number of people triples from Day 2, reaching 70 * 2 = 140 people.
* **Total for the first three days:** 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.
* **Remaining days:** Conor observes an average of 60 people per day for the remaining 5 days.
* **Total for the remaining days:** 60 people/day * 5 days = 300 people.
* **Total for the week:** 260 + 300 = 560 people.


Therefore, Conor saw a total of 560 people at the beach that week. 


**Answer:** 560

"Let's break down the popcorn problem step-by-step.

* **Initial Popping:** The initial 30 seconds see 20 kernels pop.
* **Increased Popping:** The next 30 seconds see three times the initial rate, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop.
* **Further Increase:** The next 30 seconds see four times the initial rate, resulting in 60 * 4 = 240 kernels popping.
* **Final Popping:** The final 30 seconds see half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so 240 / 2 = 120 kernels pop.
* **Residual Popping:**  The kernels left over from the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat, with 120 kernels / 4 = 30 kernels popping.
* **Total Popping:** The total number of kernels popped is 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 + 30 = 440 kernels.


Therefore, Garrett has 440 kernels to eat.

"To determine the total dog food consumption for the Kennel's dogs, we need to consider the daily food intake of each breed and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. 

* **German Shepherds:** 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg/day
* **Bulldogs:** 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg/day
* **Total weekly consumption:** 15 kg/day * 7 days/week = 105 kg
 
Therefore, the Kennel will need 105 kg of dog food in a week. 


**Answer:** 105

"The total number of legs on the farm is determined by the sum of the legs from all the animals.  

* **2-legged animals:** 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs
* **4-legged animals:** 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs
* **Total legs:** 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

Therefore, the total number of animal legs on the farm is 80.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the tower has a total of 32 blocks.  We are given that there are 4 blue blocks, and twice as many yellow blocks, which means there are 8 yellow blocks.  Therefore, the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 + 8 = 12.  We can then find the number of red blocks by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks: 32 - 12 = 20. 

**Answer:** 20

"Let's break down the problem. Elvis's journey consists of two segments: a westward movement of 5 hours at a speed of 18 mph, followed by an eastward journey of 8 hours at the same speed.  

To determine the final distance from his house, we need to consider the total distance traveled.  

* **Distance West:** 
   * Distance = Speed x Time
   * Distance West = 18 mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

* **Distance East:**
   * Distance East = 18 mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

* **Total Distance:**
   * Total Distance = Distance West + Distance East = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Therefore, Elvis is **234 miles** from his house.

"The boat's value depreciates by a cumulative percentage each year.  

* **Year 1:**  A 30% depreciation results in a value of $6300.
* **Year 2:** Another 30% depreciation leads to a value of $4410.
* **Year 3:** A 20% depreciation leaves the boat at $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"To determine the number of pink candies, we first need to calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies.  We know there are 54 red candies, and twice that amount of orange candies, so there are 108 orange candies.  Furthermore, half the number of red candies is 27 yellow candies.  Therefore, the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  Subtracting this total from the total number of candies in the bag, we find the number of pink candies: 232 - 189 = 43. 


**Answer:** 43

"Let's break down the cost of Helen's trip.  

* **Hotel Cost:**  The hotel cost $80 per night for three nights, so the total hotel cost is $80 * 3 = $240.
* **Bus Fare:** Each bus trip cost 10% of the hotel cost, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8.  Over seven trips, the total bus fare is $8 * 7 = $56.
* **Total Cost:** The total cost of the trip is the sum of the hotel and bus costs: $240 + $56 = $296. 


Therefore, Helen paid $296 for her trip.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Dallas has 21 marbles remaining after dropping 4. 
* This means he had 25 marbles initially.
* To find the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we can subtract the number of marbles Dallas had initially from the total number of marbles Mazie had: 52 - 25 = 27.

Therefore, Mazie gave Darla **27** marbles. 
"
"The total cost can be determined by adding the cost of the adult tickets, the child ticket, and the popcorn. 

* Adult ticket cost: 1 adult * $12/ticket = $12
* Child ticket cost: 1 child * $8/ticket = $8
* Popcorn cost: 2 popcorns * $3/popcorn = $6

Therefore, the total cost is $12 + $8 + $6 = $26. 


**Answer:** $26

"The force required to move the car is determined by the weight of the vehicle and its contents.  

The total weight of the car and its occupants is 1600 pounds.  Since the force required is 1% of the total weight, the force needed is 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds. 


 
"
"To determine the total length of crepe paper James needs, we first need to understand the concept of perimeter. The perimeter of a rectangle is the total length of all its sides added together.  

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the following formula:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, James's backyard fence is a rectangle with a length of 20 feet and a width of 15 feet.  

Therefore, the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet.

**Answer:** James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.

"To determine the total cost of Avery's place settings, we need to consider the cost of each component: dinner plates, bowls, and salad plates. 

* **Dinner Plates:**  The cost per dinner plate is $6.00.  
* **Bowls:** The cost per bowl is $5.00.
* **Salad Plates:** The cost per salad plate is $4.00.

We need to calculate the total cost for each component and then sum the costs. 

**Total Cost:**

* Dinner Plates: 12 people * 3 place settings/person = 36 place settings * $6.00/place setting = $216.00
* Bowls: 12 people * 3 place settings/person = 36 place settings * $5.00/place setting = $180.00
* Salad Plates: 12 people * 3 place settings/person = 36 place settings * $4.00/place setting = $144.00

**Total Cost:** $216.00 + $180.00 + $144.00 = $540.00

"To determine the cost of the hot dogs, we first need to calculate the total number of hot dogs required. John is hosting 20 guests and each guest consumes 2 hot dogs, resulting in a total of 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  

Subtracting the 4 leftover hot dogs, we have 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs to purchase.  

Finally, we need to determine the cost per pack. A pack contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2.  Therefore, the total cost is 36 / 6 = 6 packs, and the total cost is 6 * $2 = $12.

"Let's break down Frances' earnings:

* **Cupcakes:** She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, resulting in a revenue of 20 * $2 = $40.
* **Cookies:** She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, generating $40 in revenue.
* **Trays:** She purchases 5 trays at $4 each, incurring a cost of 5 * $4 = $20.
* **Total Revenue:** Her total earnings are $40 + $40 + $20 = $100.

Therefore, Frances has $100 left.

* **Second Street:**  Each child joins another, so the number increases by 1.
* **Third Street:** Each child joins another 2, so the number increases by 2.
* **Final:** The original 5 children leave, so the number decreases by 5.

Therefore, the final number of children is 3. 


**Answer:** 3

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'b' represent the age of the older brother.
    * Let 's' represent the age of each of the three sisters.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know b = 2s (the older brother is twice the age of the younger brother).
    * We also know s = 16 (all sisters are the same age).

* **Solve for the age of the older brother:**
    * Substitute the value of 's' into the first equation: b = 2 * 16 = 32

* **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**
    * Total age = b + 3s = 32 + 3 * 16 = 32 + 48 = 80

**Therefore, the total age of all siblings is 80 years.**

"Let's break down the time commitment:

* **Meditation:** Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice daily, totaling 30 minutes per day.  Over a week, this translates to 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes.
* **Yoga:**  She practices yoga for 1 hour per day, five days a week, equating to 1 hour/day * 5 days/week = 5 hours.
* **Total Weekly Time:**  Combining the meditation and yoga, Charisma dedicates 150 minutes + 5 hours = 150 minutes + 300 minutes = 450 minutes per week.
* **Total Time over 4 Weeks:**  Over four weeks, her total time commitment is 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes.


**Answer:** 1800 minutes

"The quilt's area is calculated by summing the areas of each shirt type.  

* Small shirts: 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet
* Medium shirts: 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet
* Large shirts: 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet

Adding these areas gives us a total of 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet. 


**Answer:** 101 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Small Sunflower:** A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is equivalent to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.
* **Large Sunflower:** The large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower, meaning it has 36 * 1.50 = 54 seeds.
* **Total Seeds:**  Therefore, the total number of seeds is 36 + 54 = 90. 


**Answer:** 90 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* George owns 18 pens.
* Timothy has three times the number of pens George has, meaning Timothy owns 3 * 18 = 54 pens.
* Sarah has half the number of pens Timothy owns, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens. 


**Answer:** 27 
"
"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Anne's height:** We know Anne is twice the height of Albert, who is 36 inches tall. Therefore, Anne's height is 2 * 36 = 72 inches.
* **Jackie's height after summer:**  Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so she is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, who is 72 inches tall. This means Jackie is 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall.
* **Jackie's height before summer:**  To find Jackie's height before summer, we subtract the 3 inches she gained during the summer from her current height: 70 inches - 3 inches = 67 inches.

**Answer:** 67 inches

"The company's daily production of 5000 bars translates to a weekly revenue of $70,000.  To determine the revenue over two weeks, we simply multiply the weekly revenue by the number of weeks: $70,000 * 2 = $140,000. 

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 in revenue over two weeks.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Calculate Ryan's total earnings:** Ryan earns $6 per week for his chores, and he completes chores for 3 weeks, so his total earnings are $6 * 3 = $18.

2. **Calculate the cost of the ice cream:**  He spends $1.25 per ice cream cone and buys it for 3 friends, so the total cost is $1.25 * 3 = $3.75.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream and chores:**  The total cost of the ice cream and chores is $3.75 + $18 = $21.75.

4. **Calculate the number of movie tickets:**  The movie tickets cost $6.50 each, and Ryan has $21.75, so he can buy $21.75 / $6.50 = 3.33 tickets. 

Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy **3** movie tickets.

"To determine the total expenditure, we must first calculate the individual costs of each purchase. Ellen's purchases total $100 (leggings) + $5 (photo frame) = $105. Lani's purchases consist of $30 (sunglasses) + 2 * $100 (bathrobes) = $30 + $200 = $230.  Finally, we sum these individual costs to obtain the total expenditure: $105 + $230 = $335.

"Josh's weekly earnings can be calculated by considering the number of days he's open and the number of cars he services per day.  

* **Cars serviced per week:**  He services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week.
* **Total earnings:**  His earnings are $4/car * 15 cars/week = $60/week. 

Therefore, Josh's earnings over two weeks would be $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

"Let's break down the cookie scenario.  

Randy begins with 18 cookies: 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar.  He consumes 9 cookies in total, leaving him with 18 - 9 = 9 cookies.  He then eats 2 oatmeal cookies, leaving him with 9 - 2 = 7 cookies.  He then gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, leaving him with 7 - 2 = 5 cookies.  Finally, he bakes 4 of each flavor, resulting in 5 + 4 + 4 = 13 cookies. 

Therefore, Randy has 13 cookies. 


**Answer:** 13

"Matthew's earnings would be determined by the price he sets for each half of his collection.  

* **Half the collection:**  He sells half of his 12 toy soldiers for $5 per toy, earning 6 toys * $5/toy = $30.
* **The other half:** He sells the remaining half of his collection for $7 per toy, earning 6 toys * $7/toy = $42.
* **Total earnings:**  The total earnings would be $30 + $42 = $72.

"To determine the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill the holes, we need to consider the net change in the number of holes each day.  

First, we need to calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during the vacation: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Next, we need to calculate the number of holes filled each day: 9 holes/day.

Finally, we need to calculate the number of holes dug each night: 6 holes/night * 14 days = 84 holes.

The total number of holes filled is 126 holes.

To determine the number of weeks to fill the holes, we divide the total number of holes filled by the number of holes dug each day: 126 holes / 84 holes/week = 1.5 weeks.


**Answer:** 1.5 weeks

"The average enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students, while Butler High School enrolls 3/4 of that amount, which is 3000 students.  The difference in enrollment is 4000 - 3000 = 1000 students. 

Therefore, the answer is **1000**.

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to isolate the quantity of chocolate chip cookies.  We can do this by subtracting the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.  

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies is: 7995 - 2595 - 3075 = 2225.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.  

We are given the following information:

* **Test tubes:** Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, and Igor gathered half that amount, meaning he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.
* **Petri dishes:** Igor gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
* **Total items:** The total number of items Igor placed on the bench is 29.

We can express this information mathematically as: 8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + beakers = 29.

To find the number of beakers, we need to solve for 'b' in the equation: 8 + 16 + b = 29.

Simplifying the equation: 24 + b = 29.

Subtracting 24 from both sides: b = 5.

Therefore, Igor lost 5 beakers.

"The caretaker needs to purchase 606 feet of line.  

**Answer:** 606 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Reservations:** Tom's restaurant receives 6 reservations per night.
* **Cost per night:**  They spend $10 on meals and $5 on wine, totaling $15 per night.
* **Weekly earnings:**  They operate for 2 days a week, so their total weekly earnings are $30 per night * 2 nights = $60.

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $60 per week.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **James's age:** We know James is twice Dora's age, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years.  Therefore, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.  James is twice her age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's age:**  We know James was born when John was 19.  Therefore, John is currently 19 + 32 = 51 years old.
* **The youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son was born when John was 32.  In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

"The problem presents a classic scenario where the time spent on a task is irrelevant to the number of oranges peeled.  The key is to recognize that the rate of peeling is independent of the number of oranges in the basket.  Therefore, the number of oranges peeled by each individual is directly proportional to the time spent peeling.

"To determine the number of slices each person receives, we first need to calculate the total number of slices.  Since each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 7 pizzas, the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56.  

Next, we need to determine the number of slices each person will receive.  There are 4 people in total, including Henry.  Therefore, each person will receive 56 / 4 = 14 slices. 


**Answer:** 14
