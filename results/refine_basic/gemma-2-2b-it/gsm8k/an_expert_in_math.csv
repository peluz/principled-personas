"Josh's profit is negative, meaning he incurred a loss.  Here's why:

* **Initial Investment:** Josh spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, totaling $130,000.
* **Value Increase:** The house's value increased by 150%, meaning it's now worth $120,000 more than its original price.
* **Profit Calculation:**  To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the increased value: $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.


**Therefore, Josh made a loss of $10,000.**

"To find the total feed needed for the final meal, we need to consider the total feed given in the morning and afternoon.  The total amount of feed given is 40 cups.  Since each chicken needs 3 cups per day, we can calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal by dividing the total feed by the number of chickens.  This gives us 40 cups / 20 chickens = 2 cups per chicken.  Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 2 cups in the final meal.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.**

* **Green House:** She sold 1/3 of her total, leaving (2/3)x.
* **Red House:** She sold 2 more than the green house, so she sold (5/3)x.
* **Orange House:** She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, meaning she sold (1/2) * (2/3)x.

* **Total Sold:**  The total number of vacuum cleaners sold is the sum of the sales from each house: (1/3)x + (5/3)x + (1/2) * (2/3)x = 5/2x

* **Remaining:**  We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so (2/3)x + (5/3)x + (1/2) * (2/3)x = 5/2x

* **Solving for x:**  Simplifying the equation, we get (2/3)x + (5/3)x + (1/3)x = 5/2x. Combining like terms, we get (10/3)x = 5/2x.  Solving for x, we get x = 5/2 * 3/10 = 3/2.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the book was discounted by 25%, meaning the sale price is 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).  

We can set up an equation to solve for the original price:

* Let 'x' represent the original price.
* The sale price is 0.75x (75% of the original price).

We know the sale price is $19.50, so:

* 0.75x = $19.50

Now, solve for x:

* x = $19.50 / 0.75
* x = $26.00

**Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.**

"Let's break down this problem using a ratio to find Allen's age in the future.

**Understanding the Ratio:**

The ratio 7:11 represents the ages of Darrell and Allen. This means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years.

**Setting up the Equation:**

* Let Darrell's current age be represented by 7x.
* Let Allen's current age be represented by 11x.
* Their total age is 162, so we have the equation: 7x + 11x = 162

**Solving for x:**

* Combine like terms: 18x = 162
* Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

**Calculating Allen's Age in 10 Years:**

* Allen's current age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99
* In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

To find the number of gold coins, we can use the following steps:

1. **Define variables:** Let 'x' represent the number of silver coins.
2. **Represent the number of gold coins:** Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is represented by 'x + 30'.
3. **Set up an equation:** The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, so we have the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110
4. **Solve for x:** Combine like terms: 2x + 30 = 110
   * Subtract 30 from both sides: 2x = 80
   * Divide both sides by 2: x = 40
5. **Calculate the number of gold coins:**  Gold coins = x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70

**Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.**

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

* **Dana's running speed:**  We know Dana runs four times faster than she walks.  Let's represent her walking speed as 'w'.  Therefore, her running speed is 4w.
* **Dana's skipping speed:**  She skips at half the speed of her run, so her skipping speed is 4w / 2 = 2w.
* **Distance covered in 6 hours:**  We need to find the total distance Dana covers in 6 hours.  
    *  Running time: 2 hours
    *  Walking time: 4 hours
    *  We know Dana spends 1/3 of her time running and 2/3 of her time walking.

**Let's calculate the distance covered in each mode of transport:**

* **Running:** Distance = Speed * Time = 4w * 2 hours = 8w miles
* **Walking:** Distance = Speed * Time = w * 4 hours = 4w miles

**Total Distance:**  The total distance Dana covers is the sum of the distances she covers while running and walking. 

**Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is:**

8w + 4w = 12w miles. 

**To find the exact answer, we need to know Dana's walking speed (w).** 

**We know Dana skips at 3 miles per hour.  Let's use this information to find her walking speed.**

* **Dana's skipping speed:** 3 miles/hour
* **Dana's walking speed:** 3 miles/hour * 2 = 6 miles/hour

**Now we can calculate the total distance:**

12w = 12 * 6 = 72 miles.

* **Remaining calories:** You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. This means you have 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories left.
* **Grams of chips:**  We need to figure out how many grams of chips you can eat given your remaining calories.  Since each serving has 250 calories, we can calculate how many servings you can have with your remaining calories. 200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings.  Since each serving is 250 grams, you can eat 0.8 servings * 250 grams/serving = 200 grams.

"Let's break down the problem:

* We know Marilyn sold 10 times the number of copies Harald sold.
* Their combined sales total 88,000 copies.

This means we can set up an equation:

*  x (Harald's sales) + 10x (Marilyn's sales) = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're given information about Adrien and Lylah's salaries over time.  We need to find their combined salary four years later.

**Key Information:**

* Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.
* Adrien's salary increased by 40% in the four years.

**Solution:**

1. **Adrien's initial salary:** We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.

2. **Adrien's current salary:**  Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his current salary is $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.

3. **Lylah's initial salary:** Since Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's, we can set up an equation: 
   * Adrien's salary = Lylah's salary * 1.30
   * $40,000 = Lylah's salary * 1.30

4. **Lylah's initial salary:**  Solving for Lylah's initial salary, we get:
   * Lylah's salary = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,77 (approximately)

5. **Lylah's current salary:**  Lylah's salary increased by 40% in the four years, so her current salary is $30,77 * 1.40 = $4300 (approximately).

6. **Total salary:**  Adrien's current salary + Lylah's current salary = $56,000 + $4300 = $60,300

**Answer:** The total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later was $60,300.

"Let's break down the problem.  

The key is to understand the pattern of the less well-rounded team's times.  Each runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.  

* **First runner:** 60 seconds
* **Second runner:** 60 + 3 = 63 seconds
* **Third runner:** 63 + 3 = 66 seconds
* **Fourth runner:** 66 + 3 = 69 seconds

To find the total time for the less well-rounded team, we simply add up their individual times: 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds.

Now, we need to find the time for the faster team.  Since each member of the faster team runs a 55-second leg, we multiply that by the number of runners: 55 seconds * 4 runners = 220 seconds.

The difference in time is the faster team's time minus the less well-rounded team's time: 220 - 258 = -38 seconds. 

The faster team wins by **38 seconds**.

We know that the total cost of buying the bags plus the transportation cost must equal the total revenue minus the profit.  

**Setting up the equation:**

22x = 30x - 400

**Solving for x:**

* Subtract 22x from both sides: 0 = 8x - 400
* Add 400 to both sides: 400 = 8x

"The cost of 8 pens is determined by the cost of one pen and the number of pens.  Since a pen costs the same as a pencil and eraser combined, we can find the cost of one pen by finding the combined cost of a pencil and eraser and then dividing by 2.  The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30, so the combined cost of a pencil and eraser is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.  The cost of one pen is $1.50.  Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $1.50 * 8 = $12.00.

"Let's break down this problem to find the number of red chickens Jerry has. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're given information about the number of red and white chickens Jerry has, the number of eggs they produce each day, and the total number of eggs he collects. We need to use this information to find the number of red chickens.

**Setting up the Equations:**

Let's use variables to represent the number of red and white chickens:

*  Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
*  Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

We can express the following relationships from the given information:

*  The total number of chickens is r + w.
*  The red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, and Jerry collects 42 eggs in total.

**Solving for 'r':**

We can use these equations to solve for 'r'. 

1. **Equation 1:** 3r + 5w = 42 
2. **Equation 2:** r = w + 2

**Solving for 'w'**

We can substitute the value of 'r' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

* 3(w + 2) + 5w = 42
* 3w + 6 + 5w = 42
* 8w + 6 = 42
* 8w = 36
* w = 4.5

**Finding 'r'**

Since we can't have half a chicken, there's likely an error in the problem statement. It's impossible to have a number of chickens that results in a fractional number of eggs. 



**Final Answer:** There is no solution to this problem as it is currently written.

"To determine the time Gary spends walking, we need to consider the perimeter of the park.  The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles.  Therefore:

Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 2 * 7.5 miles = 15 miles

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is 15 miles and the speed is 3 miles per hour.  Therefore:

Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem describes a scenario where two pools are emptying at a constant rate. We need to find the amount of water in the small pool at a specific point in time.

**Setting up the Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the initial amount of water in the small pool.
* Since the big pool had twice the water of the small pool 4 minutes ago, it had 2x gallons.

**Analyzing the Changes**

* Both pools lose 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, resulting in a total loss of 16 gallons.

**Formulating the Equation**

* The problem states that the big pool now has four times the water of the small pool. This translates to: 8x = 4(x - 16)

**Solving for x**

* Simplify the equation: 8x = 4x - 64
* Solve for x: 4x = -64
* Divide both sides by 4: x = -16

**Addressing the Issue**

* We arrive at a negative value for x. This indicates that the problem is inconsistent. It's impossible for the water levels to change in this way. 


**Conclusion**

The problem as stated is not logically sound. There is no solution that satisfies the given conditions.

We know she'll pay $165 per month for 12 months.  To find her remaining balance, we need to consider the total amount she'll pay.

* **Total payment:** $165/month * 12 months = $1980

* **Total amount to be repaid:** $1980 + $200 (the extra amount) = $2180

* **Remaining balance:** $2000 (original loan) + $2180 (total repayment) - $1980 (total paid) = $2080

* **Large holes:**  He takes 10 minutes per large hole to dig 15 large holes, so the total time is 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Finally, we add the time spent on each type of hole: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

To convert this to hours, we divide by 60 minutes per hour: 240 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig all the holes.

"Let's solve this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let Ruby's current age be represented by 'R'.
*  Let Sam's current age be represented by 'S'.

We are given the following information:

*  R = 6S  (Ruby is 6 times older than Sam)
*  R + 9 = 3(S + 9) (In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam)

Now, we can set up a system of equations:

1.  R = 6S 
2.  R + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Let's substitute the first equation into the second equation:

* 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

Simplify and solve for S:

* 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
* 3S = 18
* S = 6

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find the answer, we need to consider the relationship between the number of cobras and mambas and the total number of spots.  

Let's break it down:

* **Cobras:** Each cobra has 70 spots.
* **Mambas:** Each mamba has 35 spots.
* **Total Spots:**  The total number of spots is the sum of spots on all cobras and mambas.

We can calculate the total number of spots by multiplying the number of cobras by the number of spots per cobra and the number of mambas by the number of spots per mamba.

* **Total Spots:** 40 cobras * 70 spots/cobra + 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots

Finally, to find half the total number of spots, we divide the total number of spots by 2.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know the car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour and covers 480 miles.  We need to find the time it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance.

The key here is understanding that the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.  This means the car in the slow lane travels at 30 miles per hour.

We can use the formula: distance = speed * time.  

Let 't' represent the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles.

"Let's break down this problem using a systematic approach. 

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have a farmer with a total of 60 animals, and we need to determine the total number of legs they have.  We know the number of chickens is twice the number of cows.

**Setting up the Equations:**

Let:
*  'c' represent the number of chickens.
*  'w' represent the number of cows.

We can express the given information as two equations:

1.  c + w = 60 (The total number of animals)
2.  c = 2w (The number of chickens is twice the number of cows)

**Solving for the Variables:**

* **Substitute:**  Since we know c = 2w, we can substitute this into the first equation: 2w + w = 60
* **Simplify:** Combine the 'w' terms: 3w = 60
* **Solve for 'w':** Divide both sides by 3: w = 20
* **Substitute to find 'c':**  Now that we know w = 20, we can plug it back into the equation c = 2w: c = 2 * 20 = 40

**Calculating the Total Legs:**

* **Chickens:** Each chicken has 2 legs, so we have 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs.
* **Cows:** Each cow has 4 legs, so we have 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs.
* **Total Legs:**  The total number of legs is 80 legs (chickens) + 80 legs (cows) = 160 legs.


**Answer:** The animals have a total of 160 legs.

* **Go-karts:** Each go-kart ride costs $10.
* **Total Budget:** Morgan has $90 to spend.

To find out how many friends she can invite, we need to consider the cost of the activities and the total budget.

**Let's use a variable to represent the number of friends:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of friends.

**Setting up the equation:**

The total cost of mini-golf is 5x. The total cost of go-karts is 10 * x.  The total cost of the activities is 5x + 10x = 15x.

The total budget is $90, so: 15x = $90

**Solving for x:**

To find the number of friends, we need to solve the equation:

15x = $90
x = $90 / 15
x = 6

**Answer:** Morgan can invite **6** friends.

"Marisa's daily savings are calculated as follows:

* **Daily cost of lollipops:** 4 lollipops * $0.25/lollipop = $1.00
* **Daily change:** $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00
* **Total savings over 5 days:** $4.00/day * 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts **$20.00** in her piggy bank.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

The train makes a series of trips between three cities, each trip covering a specific distance. We need to determine the number of days it takes for the train to complete a full service cycle.

**Key Information:**

* **Trip Distance:** The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than the combined distance from the second to the third city to the first city.
* **Service Interval:** The train requires service every 18,000 miles.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the distance from the third city to the first city:**
   * The second city to the third city is 100 miles.
   * The third city to the first city is 50 miles less than that, so it's 100 - 50 = 50 miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance of the trip:**
   * The total distance for one trip is 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in a day:**
   * The train travels 225 miles per trip * 3 trips = 675 miles in a day.

4. **Calculate the number of days between services:**
   * The train needs service every 18,000 miles.
   * The total distance traveled in a day is 675 miles.
   * The number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles/day = 26.67 days.

5. **Round to the nearest whole number:**
   * The train needs service every 26.67 days, which rounds to **27 days**.


**Answer:** 27 days

"Let's break down the problem to find the total travel time.

* **Trip to friend's house:**  We know the distance is 200 miles and the speed is 70 mph.  Therefore, the time taken is 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours.

* **Detour:** The detour adds 10 miles to the trip, and the speed remains 70 mph.  The time taken for the detour is 10 miles / 70 mph = 0.14 hours.

* **Return trip:** The return trip is 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph.  The time taken is 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours.

* **Total time:**  To find the total time, we add the time for each leg of the journey: 2.86 hours + 0.14 hours + 3 hours = 6.00 hours.


**Therefore, the total time for the trip is 6.00 hours.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Mask Refusal:**  We know 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
* **Shoplifting:**  The number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 4 times the number of mask refusals, minus 5.  This means 4 * 3 - 5 = 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
* **Physical Violence:** Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. This means 3 * 7 = 21 people were kicked out for physical violence.
* **Total:** To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number of people kicked out for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out. 

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 3 - 7 - 21 = 10.

"Let's solve this problem using a simple algebraic approach. 

Let 'x' represent the original amount of land Mr. Ruther had.  We know that he sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares.  This can be represented as an equation:

(3/5)x = 12.8

To find the original amount of land, we need to isolate 'x'.  Here's how:

1. **Multiply both sides by 5/3:** 
   (5/3) * (3/5)x = 12.8 * (5/3)

2. **Simplify:** x = 21.33 hectares (approximately)

**Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had approximately 21.33 hectares of land.**

"Let's break down the problem.  We know Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.  This tells us that Rose bought 4 times the amount of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.  

To find out how many onions Sophia bought, we can use the information that Rose bought 12 onions.  Since Rose bought 4 times the amount Sophia bought, we can divide the number of onions Rose bought by 4 to find the number of onions Sophia bought. 

12 / 4 = 3.  This means Sophia bought 3 onions.

Now, we can find out how many potatoes Sophia bought.  We know Rose bought 4 potatoes and Sophia bought 3 onions.  We can subtract the number of onions Sophia bought from the number of potatoes Rose bought to find the number of potatoes Sophia bought. 

4 - 3 = 1.  This means Sophia bought 1 potato.

Finally, to find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add the number of onions and potatoes she bought.

"Let Shiloh's nephew's current age be represented by the variable 'n'.  

In seven years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.  We know that in seven years, Shiloh will be three times his nephew's age.  This can be represented as an equation:

3n = 51

To find the nephew's current age, we need to solve for 'n'.  Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:

n = 51 / 3 
n = 17

Therefore, Shiloh's nephew is currently **17 years old**.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'A' represent Anna's goals.
    * Let 'M' represent Mark's goals.
    * Let 'R' represent Richie's goals.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * R = M + 20  (Richie scored 20 more than Mark)
    * R = A + 45  (Richie scored 45 more than Anna)

* **Use the given information to solve for the variables:**
    * Since R = M + 20 and R = A + 45, we can set the two equations equal to each other: M + 20 = A + 45
    * Solve for A: A = M + 25 
    * Substitute this value of A back into the equation R = A + 45: R = (M + 25) + 45
    * Simplify: R = M + 70
    * We know R = 80, so: 80 = M + 70
    * Solve for M: M = 10

* **Calculate the total goals:**
    * A = M + 25 = 10 + 25 = 35
    * R = M + 70 = 10 + 70 = 80
    * Total goals = A + M + R = 35 + 10 + 80 = 125

"Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.  He spends $5 on wooden action figures for the first three days, and then $2 on plastic action figures for the remaining days.  

To find the total number of action figures he has at the end of the week, we need to consider the number of wooden figures and the number of plastic figures. 

* **Wooden figures:**  He spends $5/figure * number of figures = total cost for wooden figures.
* **Total cost for wooden figures:** $5/figure * number of figures
* **Money left:** $70 - (total cost for wooden figures)
* **Plastic figures:** Peter spends $2/figure * number of figures = total cost for plastic figures.
* **Total cost for plastic figures:** $2/figure * number of figures
* **Total cost for the week:** $5/figure * number of figures + $2/figure * number of figures
* **Total cost for the week:** $7/figure * number of figures
* **Total number of figures:** $70 / $5 = 14 wooden figures
* **Total number of figures:** $70 / $2 = 35 plastic figures
* **Total number of figures:** 14 + 35 = 49 figures

"Let's break down the food truck's profit calculation. 

* **Cost per sandwich:**  The cost of the bread is $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches. Therefore, the cost per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.  
* **Cost of cheese and condiments:** The truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments for every 10 sandwiches. This means the cost per sandwich for these ingredients is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.
* **Total revenue:** The food truck sells each sandwich for $7.00.  They sell 10 sandwiches, so their total revenue is $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.
* **Total cost:** The total cost of the sandwiches is $0.30 per sandwich * 10 sandwiches = $3.00.

"To determine the correct temperature for Maggie's oven, we need to account for the discrepancy between the set temperature and the actual temperature. 

The oven is 18 degrees hotter than the set temperature, so we need to adjust the target temperature to account for this. 

Let's break it down:

* **Percentage difference:** The oven is 18 degrees hotter than the set temperature.
* **Target temperature:** The recipe calls for 520 degrees.

To find the adjusted temperature, we can use the following formula:

Adjusted Temperature = Target Temperature * (1 + Percentage Difference / 100)

Plugging in the values:

Adjusted Temperature = 520 degrees * (1 + 18 / 100) 
Adjusted Temperature = 520 degrees * 1.18
Adjusted Temperature = 599.6 degrees

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to **599.6 degrees** to ensure the recipe is cooked correctly.

"Let's break down this problem strategically.  

We're given that the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.  Let's use variables to represent the number of each color:

*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  Since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, we can represent the number of red jelly beans as 0.99b.
*  Similarly, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, meaning the number of green jelly beans is 1.01b.

Now, we can set up an equation:

b + 0.99b + 1.01b = 4500

Combining like terms, we get: 2.99b = 4500

To solve for 'b', divide both sides by 2.99:

b = 1500

Now, we can find the difference in green and red jelly beans:

* Green jelly beans: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515
* Red jelly beans: 0.99 * 1500 = 1495

Therefore, the jar contains 15 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To determine the number of hours George needs to work, we need to calculate the total cost of the dental work and then divide that by his hourly wage. 

The total cost of the two implants is $2000 * 2 = $4000.  Since one implant requires an additional $500 for a crown, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500.

George needs to raise $4500 - $600 = $3900.  

To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs to raise by his hourly wage: $3900 / $15 per hour = 260 hours.

"Let's analyze the given information.  We know that the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 degrees.  

Let 'x' represent the measure of the smallest angle.  The other two angles can be expressed as 2x and 3x respectively.  

Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180

Solving for x, we find:

x = 180 / 6 = 30 degrees

The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so it measures:

3 * 30 = 90 degrees

"Ashley's internet connection speed is 20,000 kilobits per second. To convert this to megabits per hour, we need to consider the conversion factor: 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb). 

Therefore, her internet speed is 20,000 kb/second * 1000 kb/Mb = 20,000,000 kb/second. 

To convert this to megabits per hour, we need to multiply by 60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour: 20,000,000 kb/second * 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 7,200,000,000 kb/hour.

Finally, we can express this in megabits per hour: 7,200,000,000 kb/hour / 1000 = **7,200 Mb/hour**.

"Let's analyze the situation. James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, meaning his total revenue is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.  The company paid $75,000 for these cars, representing 30% of the total cost.  

To calculate James's profit, we subtract the company's acquisition cost from the total revenue: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.  

Finally, James earns a 10% commission on this profit.  Therefore, his commission is 0.10 * $175,000 = $17,500.

"To determine the time it takes Tom to catch up to Bob, we need to consider the relative speed at which Tom is closing the distance between them. 

The relative speed is the difference between Tom's speed and Bob's speed: 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

Therefore, Tom will catch up to Bob in the time it takes to travel the distance between them at this relative speed.  

The distance is 75 miles.  

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 mph = 5 hours.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Soil Digging Rate:** Bill digs 4 feet per hour through soil.
* **Clay Digging Rate:** He digs half as fast through clay, meaning he digs 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet per hour through clay.

**Total Digging:**

* **Soil Digging Time:**  We need to find the time it takes to dig 24 feet of soil.  
   * Time = Distance / Rate
   * Time (soil) = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

* **Clay Digging Time:** We need to find the time it takes to dig 8 feet of clay.
   * Time (clay) = Distance / Rate
   * Time (clay) = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

**Total Time:** To find the total time, add the time for soil and clay.
   * Total Time = Time (soil) + Time (clay) = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

**Answer:** It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

*  Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
*  Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:** 4s + 2g = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)
* **Equation 2:** s + g = 20 (The total number of heads is 20)

To solve for 's', we can use a method called substitution.  

1. **Solve Equation 2 for 'g':**  g = 20 - s
2. **Substitute this value of 'g' into Equation 1:** 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
3. **Simplify and solve for 's':** 4s + 40 - 2s = 70  =>  2s = 30  =>  s = 15

**Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.**

"The cat's speed is 15 feet per second.  To find the turtle's speed, we need to consider the relationship between the cat's speed and the turtle's speed.  The turtle's speed is 1/5th of the cat's speed.  Therefore, the turtle's speed is 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second.  

To find the distance the turtle crawls in 40 seconds, we use the formula: distance = speed * time.  The turtle's speed is 3 feet/second and it crawls for 40 seconds, so the distance is 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.

"Let's break down this problem to find the difference in scores.  

**Understanding the Scoring System**

* **Enemies:**  Each enemy jumped on earns 10 points.
* **Berries:** Each berry collected earns 5 points.
* **Time:**  Each second remaining on the timer earns 30 points.

**Setting up the Variables**

Let's use variables to represent the unknown values:

*  Let 'E' represent the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
*  Let 'B' represent the number of berries Emma collects.
*  Let 'T' represent the time Ava takes to finish the level.

**Formulating the Equations**

We know the following:

* Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: E = B + 8
* Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: B = E - 3
* Ava finishes 4 seconds slower: T = T' + 4 

**Solving for the Scores**

We need to calculate the points for each player based on the information provided. 

* **Ava's Score:** 
    * Enemies: 10 * (E)
    * Berries: 5 * (B)
    * Time: 30 * (T - 4)
* **Emma's Score:**
    * Enemies: 10 * (B)

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.  We're given that Tanya makes a salt scrub in a 10-ounce jar, and we need to figure out how much oil she uses. 

Here's how we can approach this:

* **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount of zest.
    * Let 'y' represent the amount of salt.
    * Let 'z' represent the amount of sugar.
    * Let 'o' represent the amount of oil.

* **Formulate Equations:**
    * We know Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, so x = fragrance.
    * We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.
    * We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2y.
    * We know she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so y = z.
    * We know the total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces.

* **Solve for the Amount of Oil (o):**
    * Since y = z, we can substitute z for y in the equation for oil: o = 2z
    * Since y = 2x, we can substitute 2x for y in the equation for oil: o = 2(2x) = 4x
    * Since x = zest, we can substitute x for zest in the equation for oil: o = 4x
    * We know x = zest, so o = 4z.

* **Find the Amount of Oil (o):**

"Let's break down this problem using a system of equations. 

Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.  Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplify the equation:
7x + 12 = 341

Solve for x:
7x = 329
x = 47

Now, we can find Becca's cards:
Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so Becca has (3 * 47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

**Answer:** Becca has 153 cards.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find the total number of eggs Cindy has.

* **Blue eggs:**  We know Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she has 5 green eggs. Therefore, she has 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.
* **Pink eggs:** She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
* **Yellow eggs:**  Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, meaning she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
* **Total eggs:**  To find the total, we add the number of each color of egg: 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

Therefore, Cindy has a total of 27 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Shipping Cost:** The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile.  
   * Weight: 4 pounds
   * Cost per pound: $0.35
   * Total shipping cost: 4 * $0.35 = $1.40
   
2. **Mileage Cost:** The book needs to be returned 20 miles away.
   * Distance: 20 miles
   * Cost per mile: $0.08
   * Total mileage cost: 20 * $0.08 = $1.60

3. **Total Cost:**  We need to add the shipping and mileage costs to find the total cost of the return.
   * Total cost: $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

4. **Refund Amount:** Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price.
   * Purchase price: $32
   * Refund percentage: 75%
   * Refund amount: $32 * 0.75 = $24.00

5. **Final Cost:**  We subtract the refund amount from the total cost to find the amount Milly will lose.
   * Total cost: $3.00
   * Refund amount: $24.00
   * Loss: $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00


**Answer:** Milly will lose $21.00.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Week 1:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
* **Week 2:** He produces half of Week 1's output, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
* **Week 3:** He produces three times the output of Week 1, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.
* **Total for the first three weeks:** 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.
* **Week 4:** To find the output for week 4, we subtract the total from the first three weeks from his total monthly production: 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

**Answer:** Boris produces 14,000 bars in the fourth week.

"Let's break down the cost of Angela's installation:

* **Mirrors:** Angela has 6 mirrors, and the installation cost is $15.00 per mirror, so she'll pay 6 * $15.00 = $90.00 for the mirrors.
* **Chandeliers:** Angela has 2 chandeliers, and the installation cost is $15.00 per chandelier, so she'll pay 2 * $15.00 = $30.00 for the chandeliers.
* **Pictures:** Angela has 20 pictures, and the installation cost is $15.00 per picture, so she'll pay 20 * $15.00 = $300.00 for the pictures.
* **Total cost:** The total cost for the installation is $129.00 (base price) + $90.00 (mirrors) + $30.00 (chandeliers) + $300.00 (pictures) = $529.00

* **Kagiyami's lifting ability:** Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 inches.  Therefore, Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting ability:** Naruto can lift 10 times higher than Kagiyami, who can lift 48 inches.  So Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.
* **Naruto's lifting height in feet:**  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Naruto can lift 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.

"
"Let's break down this problem using a simple approach. 

The key is to recognize that the time it takes to travel a distance is directly proportional to the speed.  

* **Kangaroos:**  They travel 18 hours at a speed of 'x'.
* **Turtles:**  They travel the same distance, but at half the speed of a kangaroo, which is 'x/2'.

To find the time it takes for the turtles, we can use the following:

* **Time = Distance / Speed**

Since the distance is the same for both, we can set up a proportion:

* **Time (kangaroos) / Time (turtles) = Distance (kangaroos) / Distance (turtles)**

Let's plug in the values we know:

* 18 hours / Time (turtles) = x / (x/2)

Simplifying the equation:

* 18 hours / Time (turtles) = 2

Solving for Time (turtles):

* Time (turtles) = 18 hours / 2 = 9 hours

**Therefore, it will take the turtles 9 hours to travel the same distance.**

"Brenda's investment will grow to $975 after 3 years.  Here's how to calculate that:

* **Simple Interest Formula:**  A = P(1 + r*t) 
   * A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
   * P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
   * r = the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
   * t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for in years

* **Applying the Formula:**
   * P = $300
   * r = 3/4 = 0.75 (as a decimal)
   * t = 3 years

* **Calculation:** A = 300 (1 + 0.75 * 3) = 300 (1 + 2.25) = 300 * 3.25 = $975

* **Large masks:** Each large mask requires 2.25 yards of material. We need to calculate the total yards needed for 8 large masks: 2.25 yards/mask * 8 masks = 18 yards.
* **Total material:** To find the total material needed, we add the material required for small masks and large masks: 40 yards + 18 yards = 58 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 58 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

"Let's break down this problem systematically.

We know that the team scored a total of 45 points.  Each of the three players contributed equally, so we can represent their scores as follows:

*  Let Dinar's score be represented by ""D""
*  Let Azibo's score be represented by ""A""
*  Let Bahati's score be represented by ""B""

We are given the following information:

* B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
* B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
* A + D + B = 45 (The total points)

**Solving for A:**

From the first two equations, we can express B in terms of A and D:

* B = A + 20
* B = D + 10

Since both equations equal B, we can set them equal to each other:

* A + 20 = D + 10

Solving for A:

* A = D + 10

**Substituting into the total points equation:**

Now we can substitute this value of A back into the total points equation:

* (D + 10) + D + (D + 20) = 45

Simplifying and solving for D:

* 3D + 30 = 45
* 3D = 15
* D = 5

**Finding Azibo's score (A):**

Now that we know D, we can find A:

* A = D + 10
* A = 5 + 10
* A = 15

**Therefore, Azibo scored 15 points.**

* **Step 2: Calculate the total number of beds occupied in two weeks.**  The hospital admits 50 patients per day, so in two weeks (14 days), they admit 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

* **Step 3: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds.**  The hospital has 1000 beds and 700 patients are admitted, so there are 1000 - 700 = 300 unoccupied beds.

* **Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after two weeks.**  The hospital has 300 unoccupied beds.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Aliya's age:** We know Aliya is 3 years old.
* **Shawna's age:** Shawna is three times Aliya's age, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.
* **Father's age:** Shawna's father is five times Shawna's age, meaning he is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.

"Let's break down the problem. Kelly is saying Courtney's number is inflated by 20%.  To find the actual number of attendees, we need to figure out how many people were there if the number Courtney reported was incorrect.

Here's how to do that:

* **Represent the overstatement:**  Let's say the actual number of attendees is represented by 'x'.  
* **Set up an equation:**  We know Courtney's reported number (48) is 120% of the actual number (x).  This can be represented as: 48 = 1.20x
* **Solve for x:** Divide both sides by 1.20: x = 48 / 1.20 = 40

**Answer:** 40 people attended the concert.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.**
* **Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, so Jason carried 2x balls.**
* **Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so Jordan carried 4x balls.**

**The total number of balls carried is the sum of the balls each person carried:**

x + 2x + 4x = 7

**Combining like terms:**

7x = 7

**Solving for x:**

x = 1

**Therefore, Jeffrey carried 1 ball.**

**To find the total number of balls brought to practice, we need to consider the number of balls each person carried:**

* Jeffrey: 1 ball
* Jason: 2 * 1 = 2 balls
* Jordan: 4 * 1 = 4 balls

**Total balls brought to practice: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total holes dug:** The pirates dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.
* **Holes after filling in two:** They filled in 2 holes, leaving 31 - 2 = 29 holes.
* **Holes on the fourth day:**  The island had 4 times the number of holes at the end of the first day, meaning they dug 29 * 4 = 116 holes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of corn chips each of the two people get.**
* **The third person gets 15 more than the two, so they get x + 15.**
* **The total number of corn chips is the sum of the chips each person gets.**

We know that the total number of corn chips is 265.  We can set up an equation:

2x + (x + 15) = 265

Now, solve for x:

3x + 15 = 265
3x = 250
x = 83.33

Since we can't have a fraction of a chip, we need to adjust our thinking.  Let's assume the number of chips each person gets is a whole number. 

* **The number of chips each person gets is 83.** 

Let's check our answer:

* **The total number of chips is 83 + 83 + 15 = 181.** 

This is not the correct answer.  We need to adjust our thinking.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of the travel.**  We know the travel cost is 50% more than the supplies, which means it's 1.50x.
* **The total cost of supplies and travel is $400.**  This means we can set up an equation: 400 = x + 1.50x
* **Solve for x:** Combining like terms, we get 400 = 2.50x.  Dividing both sides by 2.50, we find x = 160.

"Let's break down this problem using a systematic approach. 

**Let's use variables:**

*  Let 'A' represent the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
*  Let 'W' represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

**Formulate equations based on the given information:**

* We know that Alex has 5 more Pokemon than Stan:  A = S + 5
* Stan has 13 fewer Pokemon than 4 times Adelwolfe's catch: S = 4W - 13
*  The total number of Pokemon caught is 339: A + S + W = 339

**Solve for Stan's catch (S):**

1. **Substitute:**  Since we know A = S + 5, we can substitute this into the third equation: (S + 5) + S + W = 339
2. **Simplify:** Combine like terms: 2S + W = 339
3. **Substitute again:**  We also know S = 4W - 13. Substitute this into the equation above: 2(4W - 13) + W = 339
4. **Solve for W:** Simplify the equation: 8W - 26 + W = 339. Combine like terms: 9W - 26 = 339. Add 26 to both sides: 9W = 365. Divide both sides by 9: W = 40.56. Round this to 41 since we can't have a fraction of a Pokemon.
5. **Find S:** Now that we know W = 41, substitute it back into the equation S = 4W - 13: S = 4(41) - 13. Simplify: S = 164 - 13. Therefore, S = 151.

**Answer:** Stan has caught 151 Pokemon.

"Sunny's earnings can be calculated by considering the sales of gingerbread and apple pie on each day and then summing the earnings from both days. 

Let's break it down:

* **Saturday:** Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
* **Sunday:** Sunny sold 5 more gingerbread boxes than on Saturday, totaling 10 + 5 = 15 boxes. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday.
* **Total Earnings:** To find the total earnings, we need to calculate the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie on each day and then add them together. 

**Total Earnings:**

* Saturday: (10 gingerbread boxes * $6/box) + (6 apple pie boxes * $15/box) = $60 + $90 = $150
* Sunday: (15 gingerbread boxes * $6/box) + (15 apple pie boxes * $15/box) = $90 + $225 = $315
* Total Earnings: $150 + $315 = $465


Therefore, Sunny earned $465 for two days.

* **Combined cooling:** The total cooling effect is 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.
* **Temperature change:** The room was 2 degrees warmer without the air conditioner, so the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature.


**Answer:** 18 degrees.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' be the number of years Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.**

* **We know the comet orbits every 75 years.** This means the time between Bill's first and second sighting is 75 years.

* **Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.**  This means Bill was 30 - x years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

* **Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age when he saw the comet for the first time.** This means Bill was 3 * (30 - x) years old when he saw the comet a second time.

* **We know Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time.**

**Now we can set up an equation:**

3 * (30 - x) = 90

**Solve for x:**

* 90 - 3x = 90
* -3x = 0
* x = 0

**Therefore, Bill was 0 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.**

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **First plane's flights:**  We know the first plane makes 'x' number of flights in a day.
* **Greece flights:**  It flies to Greece for (3/4)x flights.
* **France and Germany flights:** The remaining (1/4)x flights are split equally between France and Germany.
* **Poland flights:** The other plane flies to Poland, and its 44 trips represent half the number of flights the first plane makes, so it makes 44 / 2 = 22 trips.

**To find the number of flights to France, we need to find the value of 'x'.**

* **The other plane's trips are half the first plane's trips:** 22 = (1/2) * x
* **Solving for x:** x = 22 * 2 = 44

**Therefore, the first plane makes 44 flights in a day.**

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Tobias' howl:**  Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
* **Chikote's howl:** Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias, so she howls for 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.
* **Combined howl time:**  Together, Tobias and Chikote howl for 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.
* **Igneous's howl:** Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined, so he howls for 60 seconds.
* **Total howl time:** The total time for all three wolves is 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.
* **Convert to minutes:**  There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the total howl time is 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Average Age:** The average age of the group is the sum of their ages divided by the number of children.  We know the total age is 20 and there are 4 children. Therefore, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years.

* **Helene's Age:** Helene is twice the average age, so she is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

* **Combined Age of Akbar and Alessandro:**  Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, so their combined age is 3 + 4 = 7 years.

* **Wilfred's Age:**  To find Wilfred's age, we subtract Helene's age and the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age: 20 - 10 - 7 = 3 years.

"Let's break down this problem.  We want to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, given that each adult receives a slice twice the size of a kid's slice. 

* **Let's represent the size of a kid's slice with the variable 'x'.**  
* **The adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's, so it's 2x.**
* **The total number of slices is 6 (2 adults + 4 kids).**

To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to consider the size of the adult's slice relative to the total slices. 

**The percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is:**

**(2x / 6) * 100%**

**Simplifying this, we get:**

**(x/3) * 100%**


**Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets is (x/3) * 100%.**

"The dance studio's monthly earnings can be calculated by considering the cost per session and the number of sessions held per week. 

First, we need to determine the cost per session:

* The studio charges a fixed fee of $25 for the rental.
* Additionally, there's a cost of $1.50 per student per session.
* Since they have 10 students, the cost per session is $25 + ($1.50/student * 10 students) = $25 + $15 = $40.

Next, we need to calculate the number of sessions per month:

* The studio rents the studio 3 days a week.
* Therefore, they hold 3 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions/month.

Finally, we can calculate the total earnings:

* The studio earns $40 per session and holds 12 sessions per month.
* Their total earnings are $40/session * 12 sessions/month = $480.

"The Smith family needs to determine the cost of filling their pool.  

First, we need to find the volume of the pool.  The volume is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and depth of the pool.  

* Length = 25 feet
* Width = 14 feet
* Depth = 4 feet

Therefore, the volume is: 25 feet * 14 feet * 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert cubic feet to gallons.  One cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons.  

* Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot = 10392 gallons.

Finally, we can calculate the cost of filling the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon.

* Cost = 10392 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $1039.20

**Answer:** $1039.20

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to find the initial charge of the power bank. We know the power bank lost a percentage of its charge over time.  

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Charge:**  Let's assume the power bank started with a full charge of 100%.

2. **First 5 Hours:** The power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour for 5 hours, meaning it lost 9 * 5 = 45% of its charge.  The remaining charge after 5 hours is 100% - 45% = 55%.

3. **Next 3 Hours:** The power bank lost 7% of its charge each hour for 3 hours, meaning it lost 7 * 3 = 21% of its charge. The remaining charge after 3 hours is 55% - 21% = 34%.

4. **Final Charge:** The power bank had 28% of its charge remaining after 8 hours. 

**Therefore, the power bank had 75% of its charge when Maria went out to the park.**

"To determine the number of plums Jamaar can purchase, we need to consider the total cost of the fruits he already bought and the remaining funds. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

The total cost of these fruits is $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

Now, we need to find out how much money Jamaar has left:

$10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Finally, we can determine how many plums he can buy:

$0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.**
* **Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x small stuffed animals.**
* **The price of large stuffed animals is 3 times the price of small stuffed animals, so each large stuffed animal costs 3 * $4 = $12.**
* **The total earnings from large stuffed animals is 12 * x.**
* **The total earnings from small stuffed animals is 4 * 2x = 8x.**
* **The total earnings from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so 12x + 8x = $120**
* **Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120**

"Let's analyze the situation.  

Jim's college degree increases his annual income from $25,000 to $75,000.  This means his total income during the four years of college is $75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000.  

He has $200,000 in student loan payments over four years.  

To calculate the total amount of money he needs to earn, we need to consider the lost income from not working during his four years of college.  This is $100,000.

Therefore, he needs to earn a total of $300,000 (college income) + $100,000 (lost income) = $400,000.

To figure out how long it takes to earn this amount, we divide the total amount needed by his annual income: $400,000 / $75,000 = 5.33 years.

"To determine the fabric needed, we first need to find the dimensions of the fabric pieces.  Since the fabric is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we can calculate the dimensions as follows:

* **Length:** The bed is 6 feet long, and the fabric is 2 feet longer, so the fabric is 6 + 2 = 8 feet long.
* **Width:** The bed is 8 feet wide, and the fabric is 2 feet wider, so the fabric is 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.

Now, to find the total area of fabric needed, we multiply the length and width of each piece:

* **Area of one piece:** 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area needed is:

* **Total area:** 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.


Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.

"Let's analyze the problem systematically.  

Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.  

* The first set had 4 more balls than the second set, so the first set had x + 4 balls.
* The third set had half the number of balls as the second set, meaning it had x/2 balls.
* The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls from all three sets: x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Now, let's solve for 'x':

1. Combine like terms: (5/2)x + 4 = 19
2. Subtract 4 from both sides: (5/2)x = 15
3. Multiply both sides by 2/5: x = 6

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set.

Since the first set had 4 more balls than the second set, Rory retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.

"Let's break down the cost of Kayla's party. 

First, we need to determine the total number of guests. Kayla has 25 classmates, plus 7 from her dance class, and 13 family members, totaling 45 guests.  

Next, we need to consider the number of additional guests.  We subtract the 4 people who can't attend from the total number of guests: 45 guests - 4 guests = 41 guests.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the additional guests.  The cost is $6 per additional guest, so we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per guest: 41 guests * $6/guest = $246.

The total cost of the party is the base fee of $125 plus the cost of the additional guests: $125 + $246 = $371.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know that Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence.  We also know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we need to figure out how much fence Sam has.  Let's represent Sam's fence length with the variable 'x'.  Since Harry has 60 feet more than Sam, we can represent his fence length as 'x + 60'.

The total length of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:

x + (x + 60) = 100

Now, let's solve for 'x':

* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 20

This means Sam has 20 feet of fence.  

To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract Harry's fence length from the total fence length:

100 - 20 = 80

Therefore, Sam has 20 feet left over.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find Marcel's earnings.

* **Trekking Bikes:**  We know 1/2 of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so there were 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes sold.
* **BMX Bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, meaning 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes were sold.
* **MTB Bikes:**  The remaining bikes were MTB bikes, so there were 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes sold.
* **Revenue Calculation:**
    * MTB Revenue: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500
    * BMX Revenue: 45 bikes * ($500 / 2) = $11,250
    * Trekking Revenue: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $6,750

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Second child's height:**  The second child is 2 inches taller than the first, who is 6 feet tall.  This means the second child is 6 feet + 2 inches = 6 feet 2 inches tall.
* **Third child's height:** The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, who is 6 feet 2 inches tall.  Therefore, the third child is 6 feet 2 inches - 5 inches = 6 feet 7 inches tall.
* **Fourth child's height:** The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall.  This means the fourth child is 6 feet 7 inches + 3 inches = 6 feet 10 inches tall.

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total area of the walls and then determine the number of gallons of paint required. 

The room has four walls, and we need to consider the area of each wall. The north and south walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, and the east and west walls are 5 feet by 8 feet. 

The total area of the walls is the sum of the areas of the four walls. 

* North and South: 10 ft * 8 ft = 80 square feet
* East and West: 5 ft * 8 ft = 40 square feet
* Total Area: 80 sq ft + 40 sq ft = 120 square feet

To determine the number of gallons of paint needed, we divide the total area of the walls by the coverage area of one gallon of paint. 

* Gallons needed: 120 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 6 gallons

The cost of the paint is calculated by multiplying the number of gallons needed by the price per gallon. 

* Cost: 6 gallons * $12/gallon = $72

Therefore, it will cost $72 to paint the room.

"To determine the number of girls in the school, we can use the concept of proportions.  

Since 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can set up a proportion:

*  40/100 = 240/x  (where x is the total number of students)

Cross-multiplying, we get: 40 * x = 240 * 100

Simplifying, we have: 40x = 24000

Solving for x, we find: x = 24000 / 40 = 600 students.

Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 600.  To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total: 600 - 240 = 360 girls.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Arnold and Madeline paint.
* Let 'y' represent the number of eggs Sarah paints.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

* We know that Arnold and Madeline paint the same number of eggs, so: x + x = 2x
* We also know that Camden and Sarah paint a total of 30 eggs: y + (y + 12) = 2y + 12
* Finally, the total number of eggs painted is 56: 2x + (2y + 12) = 56

**3. Solve for 'y':**

* Simplify the second equation: 2y + 12 = 56 - 2x
* Isolate 'y': 2y = 44 - 2x
* Solve for 'y': y = 22 - x

**4. Solve for 'x':**

* We know that Arnold and Madeline paint the same number of eggs, so we can substitute the value of 'y' from step 3 into the first equation: x + x = 2x
* Simplify: 2x = 2x
* Solve for 'x': x = 11

**5. Solve for 'Camden's' eggs:**

*  Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted y + 12 = 22 - x + 12
*  Substitute the value of 'x' we found: 22 - 11 + 12 = 23

**6. Find the Difference:**

*  Camden painted 23 eggs and Arnold painted 11 eggs.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let's use variables:**
    * Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
    * Let 'J' represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
    * Let 'K' represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

* **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * J = C + 5  (Jim collected 5 more than Carlos)
    * C = 2K (Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey)
    * J + C + K = 60 (They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally)

* **Solve for the variables:**
    * Substitute the first two equations into the third equation: (C + 5) + 2K + K = 60
    * Simplify: C + 3K + 5 = 60
    * Substitute C = 2K into the equation: 2K + 3K + 5 = 60
    * Combine like terms: 5K + 5 = 60
    * Subtract 5 from both sides: 5K = 55
    * Divide both sides by 5: K = 11 
    * Substitute K = 11 into the equation C = 2K: C = 2 * 11 = 22
    * Substitute C = 22 and J = C + 5 into the equation J = C + 5: J = 22 + 5 = 27

* **Find the number of seashells each person gets:**
    * Each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding the Problem:**

We're given two pieces of information about the ages of Wendy and Colin:

* **Wendy's age in relation to Colin's future age:**  Wendy's age is five times Colin's age in seven years.
* **Colin's age in 25 years:** Colin's age in 25 years will be one-third of Wendy's current age.

**Setting up the Equations:**

Let's use variables to represent their ages:

*  Let Colin's current age be represented by ""C""
*  Let Wendy's current age be represented by ""W""

We can translate the given information into equations:

*  W = 5(C + 7)  (Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age in seven years)
*  C + 25 = (1/3)(W + 25) (Colin's age in 25 years in terms of Wendy's current age)

**Solving for Colin's Age:**

Now we have two equations, and we can solve for our two unknowns:

1. **Substitute:**  Since we know W = 5(C + 7), substitute this into the second equation:
   C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7) + 25)

2. **Simplify and Solve:**
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 35 + 25)
   * C + 25 = (1/3)(5C + 60)
   * C + 25 = (5/3)C + 20
   * C + 5 = (5/3)C
   * (2/3)C = 5
   * C = 25/2

3. **The Answer:**
   Colin is currently 25/2 years old, which simplifies to 12.5 years old.


**Therefore, Colin is 12.5 years old.**

* **Ronnie's consumption:** 5 gallons are consumed.

To find the final amount, we need to calculate the total amount consumed: 4 + 7 + 5 = 16 gallons.

The remaining amount is: 24 - 16 = 8 gallons.

Finally, to determine the amount per person, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people: 8 / 3 = 2.67 gallons.


**Answer:** 2.67 gallons

"Let's solve this problem algebraically.  

We're given the equation:  ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40.""  

This translates to the equation: 4x + 8 = 40

To solve for 'x', we need to isolate it.  

1. **Subtract 8 from both sides:** 4x = 32

2. **Divide both sides by 4:** x = 8

Therefore, there are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Red Stripes:**  We know one-third of the fish have red stripes, so we can calculate that as (1/3) * 66 fish = 22 fish.
* **Remaining Fish:**  The remaining fish are those that don't have red stripes.  We find this by subtracting the number of red-striped fish from the total: 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish.
* **Blue Stripes:**  5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.  This is (5/11) * 44 fish = 20 fish.
* **Total:**  To find the total number of fish with red and blue stripes, we add the number of red-striped and blue-striped fish: 22 fish + 20 fish = 42 fish.


**Answer:** 42

"The height of the roof is determined by the height of the second floor minus the height of the first floor.  

The second floor is 7 times the height of Mattison, who is 60 inches tall.  Therefore, the second floor is 7 * 60 = 420 inches high.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is three times the height of Mattison, who is 60 inches tall.  Therefore, the first floor is 3 * 60 = 180 inches high.

The height of the roof is then 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

"Deandre will earn $64.00 after selling all the tunas. 

Here's how we can determine that:

* **Total weight:** Deandre caught 3 tunas, with a total weight of 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.
* **Earnings per kilogram:** Each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.
* **Total earnings:**  To find the total earnings, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram: 128 kg * $0.50/kg = $64.00

"To find Trinity's profit, we need to determine the selling price of the magazines and then calculate the difference between that price and the cost price. 

The selling price is 11/8 of the cost price, which is $72.  

To find the selling price, we can set up a proportion:

11/8 = Selling Price / $72

Solving for the selling price, we get:

Selling Price = (11/8) * $72 = $99

The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

Profit = $99 - $72 = $27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is **$27**.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Low setting:** The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day at the low setting. Over 3 days, it removes 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.
* **Medium setting:** The medium setting removes twice the amount of water as the low setting, so it removes 1 liter/day * 2 = 2 liters/day. Over 3 days, it removes 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.
* **High setting:** The high setting removes twice the amount of water as the medium setting, so it removes 2 liters/day * 2 = 4 liters/day. Over 5 days, it removes 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Finally, we add the amounts from each setting: 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 30 liters.


Therefore, the total amount of water removed is **30 liters**.

**1.  Volume of the Jar:**

* The jar is a square with sides of 6 inches.  
* The volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height.
* Volume = 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

**2.  Volume of the Jelly Beans:**

* The packing efficiency is 80%, meaning the jelly beans are packed in a way that uses 80% of the space.
* The volume of the jelly beans is 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches.

**3.  Number of Jelly Beans:**

* We know the volume of the jelly beans is 432 cubic inches.
* The volume of a jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.
* The number of jelly beans is 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

"The total number of students is 40.  Since each group has 8 students, there are 40 students / 8 students/group = 5 groups.  Each group needs 45 minutes, so the total time is 5 groups * 45 minutes/group = 225 minutes. 

**Answer:** 225 minutes

"Ali must pay John $100. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Tables:** John made 4 tables at $20 each, totaling 4 * $20 = $80.
* **Roof Frames:** John made 2 roof frames at $10 each, totaling 2 * $10 = $20.
* **Total Cost:** The total cost is $80 + $20 = $100.

"Let's break down the problem.  We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, and we need to find the length of the longer piece.  

* **Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.**
* **The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4x.**
* **The total length of the board is the sum of the two pieces: x + 4x = 40 feet**
* **Combining like terms: 5x = 40 feet**
* **Solving for x: x = 8 feet**
* **The longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, so it's 4 * 8 = 32 feet.**

**Answer: 32**

"To find the amount of seasoning needed, we need to determine the total tablespoons required for 5 pounds of beef.  Since he uses 2 tablespoons per pound, we can calculate this as follows:

* **Total tablespoons =  Beef amount * Seasoning per pound**
* **Total tablespoons = 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons**

Therefore, Aiden will need **10 tablespoons** of seasoning.

"Luke needs to buy fabric for 5 windows, each 35 inches wide.  He wants to buy twice the total width of the windows, so he needs to calculate the total width of the windows first.  The total width of the windows is 5 windows * 35 inches/window = 175 inches.  To find the total fabric needed, we multiply the total window width by 2: 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches.  Therefore, Luke needs to buy 350 inches of fabric. 


**Answer:** 350 inches

"The cost of the call is determined by the time spent on the call.  We can break it down as follows:

* **First 16 minutes:**  $0.25/minute * 16 minutes = $4.00
* **Remaining 20 minutes:** $0.20/minute * 20 minutes = $4.00
* **Total cost:** $4.00 + $4.00 = $8.00

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is $8.00. 


"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Monday's rainfall:** 2 inches
* **Tuesday's rainfall:**  The rainfall on Tuesday is 1 inch more than twice Monday's rainfall.  

To find the rainfall on Tuesday, we need to calculate:

* Twice Monday's rainfall: 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches
* One more than twice: 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches

Therefore, there will be **5 inches** of rain on Tuesday.

"Let's solve this problem systematically.

Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.  Let 'b' represent the number of brownies she made. We know the following:

*  **b = 3c - 2**  This equation tells us the number of brownies is three times the number of cupcakes minus 2.
*  **Each person gets 2 treats.**  This means the total number of treats is 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats.

We can set up an equation to represent the total number of treats:

* **b + c = 10**

Now, substitute the expression for 'b' from the first equation:

* **(3c - 2) + c = 10**

Simplify and solve for 'c':

* **4c - 2 = 10**
* **4c = 12**
* **c = 3**

Therefore, Carly made **3** cupcakes. 


"
"Let's break down the cost:

* **Manicure and pedicure discount:** $35 (manicure) + $40 (pedicure) * 0.20 (20%) = $35 + $8 = $43
* **Nail art cost:** $3/nail * 10 nails = $30
* **Total cost:** $43 (discounted price) + $30 (nail art) = $73

Therefore, Karen would pay $73 in total. 


"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Total issues from the 3 magazines:** 3 magazines * 12 issues/magazine = 36 issues
* **Total issues from the 1 magazine:** 1 magazine * 6 issues/magazine = 6 issues
* **Total issues from the 4-issue magazine:** 1 magazine * 24 issues/magazine = 24 issues
* **Total issues:** 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues

Therefore, Susan receives a total of 66 issues per year. 


**Answer:** 66 
"
"Let's break down the problem systematically.

We know Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and Shelley has 8 more than Kim.  This translates to the following equations:

*  Let 'x' represent the number of paintings Kim has.
*  Shelley has x + 8 paintings.
*  Samantha has (x + 8) - 12 paintings.

We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings.  Therefore:

(x + 8) - 12 = 27

Simplifying the equation:

x - 4 = 27

Solving for x:

x = 31

**Answer: Kim has 31 paintings.** 
"
"The toy's price follows a pattern of increase, then decrease.  Let's break it down:

* **November:** $40
* **December:**  An 80% increase from November's price results in a new price of $40 + (80/100)*$40 = $72
* **January:** A 50% decrease from the December price yields a final price of $72 - (50/100)*$72 = $36

Therefore, the price of the toy after the January discount is **$36**.

"The mean score is calculated by summing all the scores and then dividing by the total number of scores.  

Therefore, the mean score for Sally's math quizzes is 63.33. 
 
**Answer:** 63.33 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* Eve started with 20 pomelos.
* She has 1/4 of her original amount left, meaning she has 20 pomelos / 4 = 5 pomelos remaining.
* To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the remaining pomelos from the original amount: 20 pomelos - 5 pomelos = 15 pomelos.

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. 


**Answer:** 15

"Let's break down the problem:

Regina wrote 9 novels last year.  We know that this represents 3/4 of the novels she has written this year.  To find the total number of novels she has written this year, we need to figure out what number, when multiplied by 3/4, equals 9. 

To do this, we can set up a proportion:

*  (3/4) * x = 9

Now, solve for x:

*  x = 9 / (3/4)
*  x = 9 * (4/3)
*  x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written **12** novels this year.

"To determine the percentage of the distance covered, we need to find the ratio of the distance Michael has traveled to the total distance between Alaska and Texas. 

The total distance is 6000 km. Michael travels 3600 km in 3 days. 

Therefore, the percentage of the distance covered is:

(3600 km / 6000 km) * 100% = 60% 


**Answer:** 60%

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Madeline's grapes:** Madeline started with 6 grapes.
* **Brother's grapes:** Her brother used 5 times the number Madeline ate, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
* **Total grapes used:** Together, they used 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
* **Grapes for pies:** The mother used 0 grapes for the pies.

**Therefore, there were 0 grapes left after the juice and pies were made.**

"To determine Bud's annual macaroni and cheese expense, we need to consider the cost of the pasta and the cheese. 

* **Pasta cost:**  The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
* **Cheese cost:**  He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for gruyere, so the gruyere cost is $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.
* **Total cheese cost:** The total cost of cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00.
* **Yearly cost:** Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so in a year he makes 52 weeks * $9.00/week = $468.00.

Therefore, Bud spends $468.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

"To determine the number of bookcases needed, we need to consider the capacity of each shelf and the total number of books Elly has. 

* **Bottom shelf:** Holds twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it holds 20 books.
* **Top shelf:** Holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it holds 15 books.
* **Middle shelves:**  Hold 20 books each.
* **Total capacity:** 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.
* **Bookcases needed:**  Divide the total number of books by the capacity of each shelf: 110 books / 55 books/case = 2 bookcases.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Let 'x' represent the number of strawberry cubes.
* Blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4: 5x - 4
* Total ice cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116

We can solve for 'x' by combining like terms:

* 6x - 4 = 116

"Let's break down the problem:

* Phineas needs to travel 200 yards, and half of that is on land and half in water.
* He hops at 20 yards per minute and swims at 10 yards per minute.

To find the total time, we need to consider the time spent on each leg of the journey.

* **Land Travel:**  He hops 100 yards, so the time taken is 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.
* **Swimming:** He swims the remaining 100 yards, so the time taken is 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Finally, the total time is the sum of these two times: 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the cost of each additional phone.** 
* **The main phone costs twice the price of an additional phone, so its cost is 2x.**
* **The total cost of the plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the additional phones.**

We know the total cost of the plan is $20.  We can set up an equation:

2x + 4x = $20

Combining like terms:

6x = $20

Solving for x:

x = $20 / 6

x = $3.33 (approximately)

Now, let's find the cost of the main phone:

Main phone cost = 2 * x = 2 * $3.33 = $6.66

Finally, the total cost of the plan is:

Total cost = Main phone cost + cost of additional phones = $6.66 + 4 * $3.33 = $6.66 + $13.32 = $20

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Day 1:** 50 people
* **Day 2:** 50 + 20 = 70 people
* **Day 3:** 70 * 2 = 140 people
* **Total for the first three days:** 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people
* **People seen the rest of the week:** 60 people/day * 5 days = 300 people
* **Total for the week:** 260 + 300 = 560 people

**Answer:** 560 
"
"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

* **Initial Popping:** 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds.
* **Next 30 Seconds:** The popping rate triples, so 20 * 3 = 60 kernels pop in the next 30 seconds.
* **Next 30 Seconds:** The rate quadruples, resulting in 60 * 4 = 240 kernels popping.
* **Final 30 Seconds:** The rate halves, so 240 / 2 = 120 kernels pop in the final 30 seconds.
* **Total Popping:**  The total number of kernels popped is 20 + 60 + 240 + 120 = 440 kernels.
* **Residual Heat:**  A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds, or 120 / 4 = 30 kernels, pop from residual heat.

**Therefore, Garrett has 440 kernels to eat.**

"To determine the total dog food needed, we need to consider the daily consumption of each breed and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. 

* **German Shepherds:** 3 dogs * 5 kg/dog = 15 kg
* **Bulldogs:** 2 dogs * 3 kg/dog = 6 kg
* **Total weekly consumption:** 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

Therefore, they will need 21 kilograms of dog food in a week.

"The total number of legs on the farm is the sum of the legs from the 2-legged and 4-legged animals.  

* 2-legged animals have 2 legs each, so there are 10 * 2 = 20 legs.
* 4-legged animals have 4 legs each, so there are 15 * 4 = 60 legs.
* The total number of legs is 20 + 60 = 80. 


**Answer:** 80

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Let 'x' represent the number of red blocks.**

* **Blue and yellow blocks:** The tower has 4 blue blocks, and twice as many yellow blocks, so there are 4 + 2 * 4 = 12 blue and yellow blocks.

* **Total blocks:** The total number of blocks is 4 + 8 + x = 32.

* **Solve for x:**  Combining like terms, we get 12 + x = 32.  Subtracting 12 from both sides, we find x = 20.

"Let's break down the problem.  Elvis's journey can be visualized as two legs of a trip.  

* **Leg 1:**  He travels 90 miles west at a speed of 18 mph.
* **Leg 2:** He travels 144 miles east at a speed of 18 mph.

To find the total distance, we simply add the distances of both legs. 

The total distance traveled is 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles. 

Therefore, Elvis is **234 miles** from his house.

"The boat's value depreciates by a consistent percentage each year.  Let's break down the depreciation for each year:

* **Year 1:**  The boat depreciates 30% of its initial value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.  
   * The value after depreciation is $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

* **Year 2:**  The boat depreciates another 30% of its value from the previous year, which is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.
   * The value after depreciation is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:** The boat depreciates 20% of its value from the previous year, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.
   * The value after depreciation is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Therefore, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Red candies:** 54
* **Orange candies:** Twice the number of red candies is 54 * 2 = 108
* **Yellow candies:** Half the number of red candies is 54 / 2 = 27
* **Total red, orange, and yellow candies:** 54 + 108 + 27 = 189
* **Pink candies:**  The total number of candies is 232, and we have 189 red, orange, and yellow candies, so the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43

"Let's break down the cost of Helen's trip. 

* **Hotel cost:**  The hotel cost $80 per night for 3 nights, so the total hotel cost is $80 * 3 = $240.
* **Bus cost:** Each bus trip cost 10% of the hotel cost, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8.  Over 7 trips, the total bus cost is $8 * 7 = $56.
* **Total cost:** The total cost of the trip is the sum of the hotel and bus costs: $240 + $56 = $296.

Therefore, Helen paid $296 for her trip.

"The force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight.  

To calculate this, we need to find 1% of the total weight.  

* **Total weight:** 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (75 pounds * 2) = 1600 pounds
* **Force:** 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds

**Therefore, John needs to exert a force of 16 pounds to move the car.**

"To determine the total length of crepe paper James needs, we need to find the perimeter of his rectangular fence.  

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

In this case, the length is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet.  

Therefore:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 35 feet = 70 feet

James needs to buy **70 feet** of crepe paper.

"Let's break down the cost of Avery's place settings:

* **Dinner Plates:** 12 guests * 3 place settings/guest = 36 place settings
* **Cost of Dinner Plates:** 36 place settings * $6.00/place setting = $216.00
* **Bowls:** 12 guests * 3 place settings/guest = 36 place settings
* **Cost of Bowls:** 36 place settings * $5.00/place setting = $180.00
* **Salad Plates:** 12 guests * 3 place settings/guest = 36 place settings
* **Cost of Salad Plates:** 36 place settings * $4.00/place setting = $144.00
* **Total Cost:** $216.00 + $180.00 + $144.00 = $540.00

Therefore, Avery will spend $540.00 on place settings.

"Let's break down the problem:

* Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.
* Anna took 2 hours longer than half of Steve's time.

To find how long Anna took, we need to calculate half of Steve's time and then add 2 hours to that.

* Half of Steve's time: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours
* Anna's time: 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

Therefore, it took Anna **7 hours** to finish the puzzle.

"To determine the cost of the hot dogs, we need to consider the total number of hot dogs needed and the price per pack. 

* **Total hot dogs needed:** John needs 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.
* **Hot dogs purchased:** He has 4 leftover hot dogs, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.
* **Packs needed:**  He needs to buy 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs.
* **Total cost:**  6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs.

"To determine the total value of James' change, we need to consider the value of each coin type:

* **Quarters:**  A quarter is worth 25 cents.
* **Nickels:**  A nickel is worth 5 cents.
* **Dimes:** A dime is worth 10 cents.

Let's calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them together:

* 25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (two nickels) + 70 cents (seven dimes) = 105 cents

Therefore, James has a total of 105 cents.

* **The three sisters are all 16 years old.** 
* **The total age of all siblings is the sum of the ages of all individuals.**

Therefore, the total age of all siblings is: x + (x/2) + 3 * 16 = 60

**Solving for x:**

1. Combine like terms: (3x/2) + 48 = 60
2. Subtract 48 from both sides: (3x/2) = 12
3. Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 24
4. Divide both sides by 3: x = 8

**The older brother is 8 years old.**

**The total age of all siblings is:** 8 + (8/2) + 3 * 16 = 60 


**Answer:** 60

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Meditation:** Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day, totaling 15 minutes/day * 2 days/day = 30 minutes per day.
* **Weekly Meditation:** Over 5 days, she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes per week.
* **Yoga:** She practices yoga for 1 hour per day, which is 60 minutes. Over 5 days, she practices for 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes per week.
* **Total Weekly Time:**  Her total weekly time is 150 minutes (meditation) + 300 minutes (yoga) = 450 minutes.
* **Total Time in 4 Weeks:** Over 4 weeks, she spends 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1800 minutes.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Small Sunflower:** A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.
* **Large Sunflower:** The large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower, meaning it has 36 * 1.50 = 54 seeds.
* **Total Seeds:**  To find the total number of seeds, we add the number of seeds in both sunflowers: 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.


**Answer:** 90

"Let's break down the problem:

* George owns 18 pens.
* Timothy has three times the number of pens George has, so Timothy owns 3 * 18 = 54 pens.
* Sarah has half the number of pens Timothy has, meaning she owns 54 / 2 = 27 pens.

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens. 


**Answer:** 27

"Let's break down the problem:

* **Anne's height:** We know Anne is twice the height of Albert, who is 36 inches tall. Therefore, Anne is 2 * 36 = 72 inches tall.
* **Jackie's height after summer:**  Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so she is now 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall.
* **Jackie's height before summer:** To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to subtract the 3 inches she gained during the summer.  This means she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall.

"Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Ryan's total allowance:**  Ryan earns $6 per week for chores, and he completes chores for 3 weeks, so his total allowance is $6 * 3 = $18.

2. **Calculate the cost of the ice cream:**  He buys ice cream for 3 friends at $1.25 per person, so the total cost is 3 * $1.25 = $3.75.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream and chores:**  The total cost of the ice cream and chores is $3.75 + $18 = $21.75.

4. **Calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy:**  The movie tickets cost $6.50 each, and Ryan has $21.75, so he can buy $21.75 / $6.50 = 3.3 tickets.

5. **Round down to the nearest whole number:** Since Ryan can't buy a fraction of a ticket, he can buy **3** movie tickets.

"Let's break down the cost of the presents:

* Ellen's purchases: $100 (leggings) + $5 (photo frame) = $105
* Lani's purchases: $30 (sunglasses) + (2 * $100) (bathrobes) = $30 + $200 = $230
* Total spending: $105 + $230 = $335

Therefore, the total cost of the presents is $335.

"Let's break down the problem systematically.

* **Define variables:**
    * Let 't' represent the number of test tubes Igor actually gathered.
    * Let 'p' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered.

* **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
    * We know Igor gathered half the requested number of test tubes: t = 16 / 2 = 8
    * We know he gathered two more Petri dishes than requested: p = 14 + 2 = 16
    * We know the total number of items is 29: t + p + beakers = 29

* **Solve for the number of beakers:**
    * We know the total number of items is 29, and we know the number of test tubes and Petri dishes: 8 + 16 + beakers = 29
    * Simplify: 24 + beakers = 29
    * Subtract 24 from both sides: beakers = 5

* **Answer:** Igor lost 5 beakers. 


**Therefore, Igor lost 5 beakers.**

"The caretaker needs to buy 606 feet of line.  

**Answer:** 606 
"
"Let's break down the problem:

* **Reservations:** Tom's restaurant receives 6 reservations per night.
* **Cost per night:**  They spend $10 on meals and $5 on wine, totaling $15 per night.
* **Weekly earnings:**  They operate 2 days a week, so their total earnings are $30 per week.

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes $60 per week.

"Let's break down the problem:

* **James's age:**  We know James is twice Dora's age, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years.  Therefore, Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. James is twice her age, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* **John's age:**  We know James was born when John was 19.  Therefore, John is currently 19 + 32 = 51 years old.
* **The youngest son's age in 3 years:** The youngest son was born when John was 32.  In 3 years, he will be 32 + 3 = 35 years old.

"The key here is to understand that the problem is asking for the difference in oranges peeled, not the difference in time.  Since both Ana and Jane peel oranges at the same rate, they will have peeled the same number of oranges after an hour. 

**Answer:** 0 
"
"Let's break down the cost:

1. **Discount:** The radiator is discounted by 80%, meaning Mark pays 20% of the original price ($400 * 0.20 = $80).

2. **Price after discount:**  The discounted price is $400 - $80 = $320.

3. **Mechanic's labor:** The mechanic charges $50 per hour and works for 3 hours, so the labor cost is $50 * 3 = $150.

4. **Total cost:** The total cost is the sum of the discounted price and the labor cost: $320 + $150 = $470.

**Answer:** $470

"To find out how many slices each person gets, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. 

* Total slices: 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices
* People: Henry + 3 friends = 4 people
* Slices per person: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

Therefore, each person can have **14** slices.
