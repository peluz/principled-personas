"Okay, let's break this down!  We've got a bunch of clues about people, their houses, and their stuff.  We need to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

**Here's how I'd approach this:**

1. **Start with the most direct clues:**  These are the clues that give us the most information right away.  Let's see if we can figure out the order of the houses and the location of some people.

2. **Look for patterns:**  Sometimes, clues will give us hints about how people are related.  For example, if we know the person who likes red lives in the second house, we can use that to figure out where the person who likes green might be.

3. **Use elimination and deduction:**  As we fill in more information, we can eliminate possibilities for other houses.  This will help us narrow down the options.

**Let's start with the clues that give us the most information:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes red and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.

* **Clue 10:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 11:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
* **Clue 12:** The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 13:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating a banana.
* **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
* **Clue 15:** The tennis player lives in the fifth house.
* **Clue 16:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 17:** The basketball player does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the fourth house.

**Now let's use other clues to fill in the gaps:**

* **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
* **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.

**Analyzing the remaining possibilities:**

* **Clue 1:** We know there are two houses between the white person and the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker cannot be in the first, second, or fourth house. 
* **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green. 
* **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house. 
* **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house. 
* **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house. 

**The answer:**

Based on all the clues, the coffee drinker lives in **house 3**.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the cat lover lives!

* **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.

This tells us the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1, and the fish enthusiast is in house 2.

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
* **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.

We know the pizza person isn't in house 1, and we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.  

**Therefore, the cat lover must live in house 2.**

"Okay, let's break this down!  We have a bunch of clues about where people live and what they eat and what flowers they have in their homes.  

Here's what we know:

* **We need to figure out where the person who had stew lives.**

Let's start by looking for clues that give us direct information about the location of the stew person.  

* **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

This tells us that the stew person is next to the grilled cheese person.

* **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

This tells us that the pizza person is to the left of the grilled cheese person.

* **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

This tells us that the rose bouquet person is to the left of the grilled cheese person.

* **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.

This tells us that the orange person is to the left of the apple person.

* **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.

This tells us that the tulip person is not in the fifth house.

* **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.

This tells us that the daffodil person is not in the fifth house.

* **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

This tells us that the apple person is to the left of the mango person.

**Now, let's put it all together!**

The stew person is next to the grilled cheese person, and the pizza person is to the left of the grilled cheese person.  We also know that the rose bouquet person is to the left of the grilled cheese person.  

**Therefore, the stew person lives in house number 2.**

"Okay, let's break this down!

We know the cat lover lives in the first house.  That's our starting point.  

Clue 1 tells us the person with tulips lives to the left of the dog owner.  This helps us visualize the houses.

Clue 2 tells us the person with daffodils doesn't live in the second house.

Clue 3 tells us there's one house between the horse owner and the person with carnations.

Clue 4 tells us the person with lilies lives to the right of the horse owner.

Now, let's think about the possibilities.  We need to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives. 


**Answer:**  The fish enthusiast lives in **house 3**. 


 
"
"Let's break down the clues:

* **Clue 1:**  The person with the phone lives in the first house.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing boots does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The person with horses and the person with the radio live next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the person with the phone is in house 1.  Clue 2 tells us the person wearing boots isn't in house 2.  Clue 3 tells us the person with horses and the person with the radio live next to each other.

This means the person with horses and the person with the radio must be in the same house.  Since the person with the phone is in house 1, the person with the radio must be in house 2.  

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in **house 2**.

"Let's break down the clues:

* **Clue 1:**  The person who drives a truck doesn't live in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the third house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck doesn't live in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

We know the person who drives a truck isn't in the third house, and the person who owns an SUV isn't in the third house. This means the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV can't be in the same house. 

We also know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, the person who owns an SUV must live in house number 2. 


**Answer:** The person who owns an SUV lives in **(B) 2**. 
"
"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Clue 1:**  The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

This tells us the order of the houses is important.  

* **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The cricketer does not live in the third house.

We know the swimmer is in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti is to the left of the person who ate fried rice.  

So, the order must be:
1. Swimmer
2. Spaghetti
3. Fried Rice

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house **(B) 2**.

"Okay, let's break this down!

We know the soccer player lives in the third house.  That's a good starting point.  

Clue 5 tells us the person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.  That means they must live in one of the other two houses.

Clue 1 tells us the golfer is to the left of the basketball player.  

Clue 2 tells us the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Clue 4 tells us the person who ate grilled cheese is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's think about the possible positions of the people.  

**Answer:**  The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house **(B) 2**.

* If the person wearing loafers isn't in house 1, they must be in house 2.
* Since the mystery book reader isn't in house 2, they must be in house 1. 


So the answer is **house 2**. 


**Answer: (B)**

"Okay, let's break this down!  We have a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they have.  

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:**  The person wearing running shoes and the person with a gameboy live next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza is to the left of the person wearing sandals.
* **Clue 3:** The person wearing running shoes isn't in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The person with tulips is to the left of the pizza person.

(C) 2
(D) 1

"Let's break down the clues:

* **Clue 3:**  We know the person eating mangos lives in house 1.
* **Clue 1:** The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies.
* **Clue 2:** The saxophonist doesn't live in house 1.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person eating apples lives.

Since the person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies, the person with the lilies must live in house 2.

The saxophonist doesn't live in house 1, so the saxophonist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the person eating apples lives in **house 2**.

"Okay, let's break this down!

We have a few clues, and we need to figure out where the truck lives. 

* **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
* **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.

* **Clue 2** tells us the SUV is next to the lilies.

* **Clue 4** tells us the rose bouquet is not in the second house.

This means the SUV and the lilies are in the same house, and the sedan and rose bouquet are in the same house. 

The only way to fit all of this information is if the truck is in house **D**.

"Let's break down the clues to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

* **Clue 1:**  The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses. 
* **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses. 

**Here's how we can think about it:**

* **Clue 1** tells us that the person wearing sandals is to the left of the person who owns horses. 
* **Clue 2** tells us the person who ate spaghetti is to the right of the person who likes history books.

**So, the person who ate spaghetti is to the right of the person who likes history books.  The person wearing sandals is to the left of the person who owns horses.  This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in house number 2.**

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Let's break it down:

* **Clue 1:**  The person with a sedan lives to the left of the person with lilies.
* **Clue 2:** The flutist doesn't live in the first house.

From these clues, we can figure out the order of the houses.  

Since the person with a sedan lives to the left of the person with lilies, and the flutist doesn't live in the first house, the person with lilies must live in house number 2. 


**Answer:**  2 
"

2. **Think about the order:** We know the mystery book reader is somewhere between the swimmer and the person with the daffodils. 
3. **Look for patterns:** We know the fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the swimmer. 

**Let's try to fill in the rest of the grid:**

"Okay, let's break this down!  We've got a bunch of clues about people, their houses, and what they're doing.  We need to figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

**Here's how I'd approach it:**

1. **Start with the most direct clues:**  These are the clues that give us the most information.  Let's see if we can figure out some relationships.

2. **Look for patterns:**  Sometimes, clues can give us clues about other clues.  For example, if we know the person who eats apples lives in the third house, we can use that to figure out other things.

3. **Eliminate possibilities:**  As we solve clues, we can cross off houses that are no longer possible.

**Let's see if we can figure it out!** 


**Here's a possible way to approach the problem:**

* **Start with the most direct clues:**  We know the person eating apples lives in the third house. We also know the person eating kiwis doesn't live in the fourth house.

* **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
* **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 5:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.

"Let's break down the clues and figure out where the pianist lives!

* **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
* **Clue 3:** There's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
* **Clue 4:** There's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

**Thinking it through:**

Since the pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other, we know they are in the same house.  The flutist is to the right of the violinist, so the violinist is on the left.

Clue 3 tells us there's one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis. This means the person eating grapes is in house 1.

Clue 4 tells us there's one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis. This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

**Answer:** The pianist lives in house 2.

"Okay, let's break this down!  We've got a bunch of clues about where people live and what they like.  Here's how we can figure out where the pianist lives:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** There are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person eating apples.
* **Clue 2:** The baseball player does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
* **Clue 5:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the tennis player.
* **Clue 6:** There is one house between the percussionist and the person who likes green.
* **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
* **Clue 8:** There is one house between the person who likes blue and the person eating oranges.
* **Clue 9:** There is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker.
* **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
* **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

**2.  Use the clues to create a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the houses and their occupants.  You can use a simple grid to keep track of the information.

**3.  Deduce the positions:**

* **Start with the most direct clues:**  Use the clues to determine the positions of the people and their characteristics. 
* **Look for patterns:**  See if you can find any repeating information or relationships between the clues.
* **Eliminate possibilities:**  As you fill in the grid, eliminate possibilities based on the information you have.

**4.  Solve for the pianist's house:**

* **Continue to analyze the grid and use the clues to deduce the location of the pianist.**


Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the process of filling in the grid and solving for the pianist's house.

"Okay, let's break this down!  We've got a bunch of clues about people, their houses, and their preferences.  

Here's what we know:

* **House 1:** The person who owns a sedan lives here.
* **House 3:** The romance book lover lives here.
* **House 17:** The person who eats apples and the person who likes yellow live next to each other.

Let's see if we can figure out where the person who eats mangos lives. 


**Here's what we can do:**

* **Look for clues that connect houses:**  We need to find out if there are any houses that are directly next to each other. 
* **Look for clues that connect people:** We need to figure out who lives next to whom. 


Let me know if you want to try to figure out the answer together! 


**Answer:**  (E) 3

"Okay, let's break this down!  We've got a bunch of clues about where people live and what they like.  Here's how we can figure out where the saxophonist lives:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The cellist does not live in the fifth house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who likes red.
* **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the percussionist lives and where the violinist lives.
* **Clue 6:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
* **Clue 7:** The person who likes green lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 9:** The person who likes red does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 10:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
* **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 12:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.

**2.  Use the clues to create a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the houses and their occupants.  You can use a simple grid to keep track of the information.

**3.  Deduce the positions:**

* **Start with the most direct clues:**  Use the clues to determine the positions of the people and their instruments. 
* **Work your way through the grid:**  Use the clues to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options. 
* **Look for patterns:**  Pay attention to the relationships between the clues and the positions of the people.

**4.  Solve for the saxophonist:**

* **Continue to analyze the grid and use the clues to determine the final position of the saxophonist.**


Let me know if you want to try working through the grid together!

**2.  Use the clues to create a grid:**

It's helpful to write down the clues and then create a grid to organize the information.  

**3.  Start filling in the grid:**

* **Start with the most direct clues:**  Use the clues to fill in the houses and their corresponding characteristics. 

**4.  Work through the clues systematically:**

* **Look for patterns:**  See if you can find any patterns or relationships between the clues.
* **Eliminate possibilities:**  As you fill in the grid, eliminate possibilities based on the clues you've already used.
* **Be careful with multiple clues:**  Sometimes multiple clues can be used to narrow down possibilities.

**5.  Continue until you find the answer:**

* **The answer:**  Once you've filled in the grid and used all the clues, you should be able to determine the number of the house where the romance book lover lives.

"Let's break down the clues:

* **Clue 3:**  The person wearing boots lives in the first house.
* **Clue 1:** The person with lilies doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the second house.

* We also know that the person with high heels can't be in the second house (Clue 2).
* Finally, we know that the person with daffodils lives in the first house (Clue 4).

**Therefore, the person wearing boots lives in house 1.**

"Okay, let's break this down!  We've got a bunch of clues about people and their houses, drinks, food, and colors.  We need to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

**Here's how I'd approach it:**

1. **Start with the most direct clues:**  These are the clues that give us the most information.  Let's see if we can figure out some relationships.

2. **Make a grid:**  It's helpful to write down the houses and their characteristics in a grid.  This will help us keep track of everything.

3. **Look for patterns:**  We need to find any patterns or connections between the clues.  For example, if we know the tea drinker lives in the first house, we can use that to figure out where other people might live.

4. **Eliminate possibilities:**  As we fill in the grid, we can eliminate possibilities.  If we know that the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes red, we can eliminate houses where those two people might not be next to each other.

5. **Keep going:**  We need to keep working through the clues and filling in the grid.  It might take a little time, but we'll get there!

**Answer:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

"
"Let's break it down:

* **Clue 2 tells us the basketball player lives in the second house.**
* **Clue 3 tells us the violinist lives in the second house.**

This means the second house has both the violinist and the basketball player.

* **Clue 1 tells us the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.**

Since the violinist and basketball player are in the second house, and the cellist is to the right of the cricketer, the order must be:

The only remaining spot for the soccer player is the **1st house**.

"Let's break this down! 

We know a few things for sure:

* **The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.**
* **The flutist lives in the fourth house.**
* **The guitarist is not in the third house.**
* **The violinist is not in the third house.**
* **The dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other.**
* **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.**
* **The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live next to each other.**
* **The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.**

Let's use these clues to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives. 

**Here's how I'd approach it:**

1. **Start with the most direct clues:**  We know the coffee drinker and flutist live in the fourth house.
2. **Look for patterns:**  The dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. 
3. **Combine clues:**  We can deduce that the person who only drinks water lives in the house to the right of the tennis player. 

**The answer:**

The fish enthusiast lives in **(A) 4**.

"Okay, let's break this down!  We've got a bunch of clues about people and their houses, and we need to figure out where the person with the computer lives. 

Here's how I'd approach this:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 3:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
* **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 6:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 8:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 9:** The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the fifth house.

* **Clue 19:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
* **Clue 20:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the first house.

**2.  Start building a grid:**

I'd write this all down in a grid, like a big table.  It's easier to see the connections that way.

**3.  Analyze and Deduce:**

* **Focus on the most restrictive clues:**  I'd start with clues that limit the possibilities the most.
* **Look for patterns:**  See if I can find any repeating information or relationships between clues.
* **Eliminate possibilities:**  As I solve clues, I'd eliminate houses that are no longer possible.

**4.  Continue to analyze and deduce:**

* **Work systematically:**  Don't jump to conclusions.  Follow the logic of the clues and work through them one at a time.
* **Be patient:**  This type of puzzle can be challenging, so don't get discouraged if it takes some time.

**5.  Check your work:**

* **Make sure my answer fits all the clues.**

"Let's break down the clues and figure out where the person who eats apples lives!

**Here's what we know:**

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

**Let's use these clues to figure out the order of the houses:**

* We know the running shoes are in the first house, the carnations are in the first, the vase of tulips is in the second, and the tea drinker is in the third. 
* We also know the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live next to each other. 
* The person who likes kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes blue. 
* The person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who likes green. 
* The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.

**Now, let's use this information to figure out where the person who eats apples lives.** 


**Answer:**  The person who eats apples lives in **(B) 2**.

"Let's break this down!

* **Clue 1:**  The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
* **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

We know the mystery book reader is in house 1.  Since the mystery book reader lives to the left of the history book buff, the history book buff must be in house 2.  

The person with the computer lives to the right of the person with the phone.  

The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television, so the person with the television must be in house 3.

The science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3. 


**Answer: (B) 3**

"No, a person with St. Vitus's Dance would likely not win a ballet competition.  

Here's why:

* **St. Vitus's Dance** is a serious condition that causes involuntary, jerky movements. 
* Ballet requires a lot of control and precision with your body.  It's really hard to do the fancy moves and jumps that are part of ballet if you can't control your body.

"It's not impossible for pigs to use Pig Latin!  Pig Latin is just a fun way to change the order of words in a sentence.  So, while pigs don't speak English or any other language in the way humans do, they could certainly play with the rules of Pig Latin. 

**The answer is (A).**

"No, a Super Bowl crowd would not be too big for the 1936 Summer Olympics venue.  

The 1936 Olympics stadium in Berlin was pretty big, and it could hold a lot of people.  Super Bowl crowds are even bigger, but the stadium was still big enough to hold them. 

So the answer is **(A) No**.

"Yes, brown rockfish are found in the waters surrounding Saint Kitts and Nevis.

"If you're afraid of insects, growing seedless cucumbers might be a good choice! 

Here's why:

* **Traditional cucumbers** need bees or other insects to help them make seeds.  That means you might see a lot of bugs around your plants.
* **Seedless cucumbers** are made in a special way, so they don't need those bugs to make seeds. 

So, if you're worried about bugs, seedless cucumbers are a good option! 

**The answer is (A).**

"Waltz is generally considered less likely to cause injuries than slam dance.  

**So the answer is (A).** 

Here's why:

* **Waltz** is a slower, more graceful dance with a lot of controlled movements. It's usually done in a structured setting.
* **Slam dance** is a high-energy, fast-paced dance style that involves a lot of jumping, spinning, and complex footwork. It can be very physically demanding.

"No, a 1943-S penny would not be good for making silverware.  

Here's why:

* **Pennies are made of copper-nickel.**  That's not the same as the kind of metal used to make silverware. 
* **Silverware is made from silver or sterling silver.**  Those are much more valuable and durable metals. 


So, it wouldn't work! 

**The answer is (B).**

"It would be **really** difficult to snowboard on Venus.  

Here's why:

* **Super Hot:** Venus is super hot, like way hotter than anything we're used to. It's so hot that it would melt your snowboard!
* **Super Pressured:** The air on Venus is super thick and super heavy, like a giant pressure cooker. That would crush anything that tried to go snowboarding there.
* **Toxic Air:**  The air on Venus is made mostly of carbon dioxide, and it's also super acidic.  You couldn't breathe it, and it would probably make your snowboard melt!
* **No Snow:** Venus doesn't have snow like we do on Earth. It's mostly just hot, dry ground. 


So, no way would you be able to snowboard on Venus! 

**The answer is (B).**

"Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was a really important Frankish king, but he wasn't involved in the Battle of Tours.  The Battle of Tours happened in 732 AD, and Pepin died in 768 AD.  So, he couldn't have been there! 

The answer is **(B) No**.

"No, Hermes and Vulcan are not the same. 

Here's why:

* **Hermes** is a Greek god, known for being a messenger and a traveler. He's also associated with commerce and thieves. 
* **Vulcan** is a Roman god, and he's known for being the god of fire, metalworking, and volcanoes. 


So, they are different gods with different roles and powers. 


**Answer:**  (B) No 
"
"Okay, so, to answer your question, yes, Ariana Grande could be a relevant topic for a presentation about PTSD. 

Here's why:

* **She's talked about her struggles with anxiety and panic attacks.**  These are things that can be connected to PTSD. 
* **PTSD is a real thing that can happen to anyone.** It's not just something that happens to soldiers or people in really bad accidents. 
* **People who are famous can help people understand mental health better.**  Ariana talking about her own experiences could help people feel less alone and more willing to talk about their own problems.


So, yeah, it could be a good topic for a presentation. 


**So the answer is: (B) Yes** 
"
"Okay, so, Bear McCreary is a really famous composer, like, he's worked on big shows and stuff. Jack Black is a funny actor and musician, but he's not really known for composing music like that. So, I think it's pretty unlikely Jack Black would be competing with Bear McCreary for awards. 

The answer is **(B) Yes**.

"No, cucumbers aren't all the same texture.  There are different kinds of cucumbers, and they can vary in how crunchy or soft they are.

"
"Okay, so you're asking if the show ""Rich and Morty"" could be triggering for kids whose parents have struggled with alcohol.  

The answer is probably **yes**.  

Here's why:

* The show deals with a lot of stuff that can be tough to watch if you've been through something similar.  Like, it talks about addiction and how it affects families. 
*  It can be really hard to see someone you love struggling with something like that, and it can make you feel sad or even angry. 
*  It's important to remember that everyone is different, and some people might be more sensitive to these kinds of things than others.


So, if you're a kid whose parents have struggled with alcohol, it might be good to talk to a grown-up you trust if you see something on TV that makes you feel uncomfortable. 


**Would you like to know more about how to talk to a grown-up about something that's making you feel sad or worried?**

"Simon Cowell can't vote for the next Supreme Court judge.  The Supreme Court is made up of people chosen by the President and then confirmed by the Senate.  So, Simon Cowell wouldn't be able to vote for anyone.

* **The Senate votes on the picks:**  The Senate has to approve the President's choices.

**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so, is euphoria linked to drug addiction?  

The answer is **yes**.  

Drugs like cocaine, heroin, and meth make you feel really good, like you're on top of the world. That's because they make your brain release a lot of a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is what makes you feel happy and excited.  But, the more you use these drugs, your brain gets used to it, and you need more of the drug to get that same feeling.  That's how addiction starts.  And when you stop using the drug, you get really sick and feel bad. 


 
"
"The answer is **(A) No**. 

Here's why:

Apollo is a powerful figure from Greek mythology, but he's not a real person. He's a god, and gods don't really have the same kind of skills and training as people do.  D'Artagnan is a fictional character from a book, and he's a skilled swordsman.  So, in a fight, D'Artagnan would probably have a better chance of winning.

"The French Defense is a pretty good opening, but it's not designed to get you a checkmate in just four moves.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 

Here's why:

The French Defense is all about controlling the center of the board and getting your pieces moving. It's not about rushing to checkmate right away.  Four move checkmate is pretty rare in chess, and it's not something the French Defense is really good at. 


"
"No, week-old chlorine water is not safe to drink. 

Here's why:

* **Chlorine is a disinfectant:**  It's added to water to kill germs, making it safe to drink.
* **Chlorine can be harmful in high concentrations:**  While it helps keep water clean, too much chlorine can make it taste bad and even be bad for you.
* **Chlorine can react with other things:**  It can react with pipes and create chemicals that aren't good for you.

It's best to let your water sit for a while to let the chlorine go away before you drink it. 


**So the answer is NO.** 
"
"No, a dichromat would probably not be able to easily distinguish chlorine gas from neon gas.  Here's why:

* **Dichromats** have trouble seeing certain colors. 
* Chlorine gas and neon gas are colorless. 
*  They are also very different in how they smell and look. 


So, a dichromat would likely have trouble telling them apart just by looking at them. 


**Answer: (B)**

"You can definitely avoid internet trolls on Reddit!  

Here's how:

* **Report them:** If someone is being mean or annoying, you can report them to Reddit. 
* **Block them:** You can block people who keep bothering you.
* **Don't feed the trolls:**  Don't respond to them or engage with their negativity. 
* **Find good communities:**  Look for subreddits that are friendly and positive. 


So yeah, you can definitely avoid them! 
"
"Sea turtles are wild animals, so they don't experience ""quarantine"" in the same way humans do.  

**The answer is (A) No.** 

Sea turtles are facing many serious threats like pollution, habitat loss, and climate change.  They are not enjoying a ""quarantine"" in the way we think of it. 
"
"I think Jesus would probably understand the Easter Bunny.  

Here's why:

* **It's about hope and new beginnings:**  Easter is all about celebrating the resurrection of Jesus, which is a big deal for Christians. The Easter Bunny is a fun symbol of spring and new life, which is a good thing to celebrate. 
* **Jesus was all about love:** He would probably be happy that people are celebrating something that brings joy and happiness to others. 

So, I think Jesus would understand the Easter Bunny. 

**The answer is (A).**

"Hornets can actually be helpful for oceanographers! 

Here's why:

* **Roads and Buildings:**  He'd need roads and buildings that could handle his size!  We'd need to build things that are way bigger than anything we have now.
* **People and Space:**  He'd probably just walk right through everything!  It would be hard to plan for a city where a giant is walking around.
* **Getting Along:**  He's a big guy, and he's probably not very good at following rules.  He might not be a good fit for working with people.

So, no, Paul Bunyan wouldn't be a good urban planner.  

**The answer is (A).**

"Okay, so lactic acid is a bit of a mixed bag.  

It's a natural thing that happens when your muscles work hard.  Think of it like this: when you run really fast, your muscles need energy, and they make a little bit of lactic acid as a byproduct.  

Now, this isn't always bad.  Your body actually has ways to get rid of it.  But if you're doing a really intense workout, and you keep pushing yourself, that lactic acid can build up and make your muscles feel sore.  That's why you might feel tired after a tough workout.

"Here's the answer:

The story of Jesus is inspired by Egyptian mythology. 

**Here's why:**

* **Similarities in Archetypes:**  There are some similarities between the story of Jesus and Egyptian mythology, particularly in the figure of the ""messiah"" or ""savior."" 
* **The Egyptian God Horus:**  Horus, the Egyptian god of the sky and the sun, was often depicted as a young, powerful figure who rose to defeat evil and restore order. This resonates with the story of Jesus's birth, his ministry, and his eventual resurrection.

"The answer is **(A) Yes**. 

Here's why:

The Common Era (CE) is the time period we're currently living in, starting in 1 AD.  Methuselah is a figure from the Bible, and the Bible is a religious text.  So, while Methuselah's lifespan is a really long time, it's not something we can measure scientifically. But, if we're talking about the longest lifespan *ever* recorded, it's possible that Methuselah's lifespan would be a record in the Common Era.

Here's why:

* **Ribs:**  The ribs protect your heart and lungs, but they're not super strong.  A hard hit could crack them.

"Yes, Karl Marx definitely influenced the Communist Party of China.  

Think of it like this:  Mao Zedong, who was the leader of the CPC, was really inspired by Marx's ideas about how society works.  Marx talked about how people are divided into different classes, and how one class (the workers) should take over from the other (the owners of the factories and businesses).  Mao used these ideas to help explain why China needed to change from a system where the rich controlled everything to a system where everyone was equal. 

So, Marx's ideas were a big part of how the CPC became what it is today.

1. **Bob and Alice:**  Bob starts with a yellow ball, Alice starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Alice gets the yellow ball and Bob gets the orange ball.
2. **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with a white ball, Alice starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Eve gets the yellow ball.
3. **Bob and Dave:** Bob starts with a yellow ball, Dave starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Dave gets the yellow ball and Bob gets the blue ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with a blue ball, Alice starts with a white ball. They swap, so Alice gets the blue ball and Bob gets the white ball.
5. **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with a red ball, Bob starts with a white ball. They swap, so Bob gets the red ball and Claire gets the white ball.

Looking at the final swap, we see that Alice ends up with the blue ball. 


**The answer is (E).**

"Let's figure out what book Claire has at the end!

Here's how the trades go:

1. **Start:** Alice has Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob has The Odyssey, Claire has Ulysses, Dave has Catch-22, and Eve has Moby Dick.

2. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Catch-22 and Dave gets Moby Dick.

3. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets Moby Dick and Eve gets Catch-22.

4. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets Ulysses and Bob gets Catch-22.

5. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Catch-22 and Alice gets Moby Dick.

6. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Ulysses and Claire gets Moby Dick.

**So, Claire ends up with Moby Dick!** 


The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets a black ball and Dave gets a blue ball.
2. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire gets a blue ball and Eve gets a black ball.
3. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets a black ball and Eve gets a blue ball.
4. **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire gets a blue ball and Dave gets a black ball.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets a blue ball and Bob gets an orange ball.

Since Bob started with a blue ball, and Alice ends up with a blue ball, the answer is **(D)**. 



"
"Let's figure out what book Bob has at the end!

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:**  Alice has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Bob has *The Odyssey*, Claire has *Frankenstein*, Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and Eve has *Ulysses*.

2. **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they switch books. So now Alice has *Frankenstein* and Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

3. **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice now has *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Eve has *Ulysses*.

4. **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books, so Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

5. **Dave and Bob swap:**  Finally, they switch books, leaving Bob with *The Odyssey*.

**So, Bob ends up with The Odyssey.** 


**The answer is (B).**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Dave is in the center midfield, Bob is on the right midfield, Claire is on the right wing, Alice is on the bench, and Eve is on the left wing.

* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave moves to the right wing, and Bob moves to the center midfield.

* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice moves to the right wing, and Claire moves to the center midfield.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire moves to the left wing, and Eve moves to the right wing.

* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob moves to the center midfield, and Claire moves to the right wing.

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave moves to the left wing, and Eve moves to the center midfield.

**So, Dave is now playing left wing!** 


The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Claire switch positions first, so Eve becomes a left winger and Claire becomes the goalkeeper. Then Alice and Dave switch positions, so Alice becomes a left winger and Dave becomes a left midfielder.  

Next, Bob and Eve switch positions, so Bob becomes the goalkeeper and Eve becomes a left winger. Finally, Dave and Bob switch positions again, so Dave becomes a left midfielder and Bob becomes a left winger. 

Since Bob and Eve switched positions again, we know that Bob is now the left winger and Eve is the goalkeeper. 

Therefore, Claire is now playing left winger.

Now, look at the final gift.  Claire has the **black ball**. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Eve is a right winger, Claire is a striker, Dave is a left midfielder, Alice is a cheerleader, and Bob is a goalkeeper.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Eve becomes a striker, Claire becomes a right winger.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes a left midfielder, Dave becomes a striker.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes a left midfielder, Claire becomes a right winger.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes a right winger, Alice becomes a striker.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes a left midfielder, Dave becomes a goalkeeper.

**So, Eve ends up playing left midfielder.** 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Eve starts with a white ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a brown ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a blue ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Eve starts with a white ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a white ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball.

So, Dave ends up with the green ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Let's look at the trades:

1. **Dave and Alice switch positions:** Dave moves to the left midfield, and Alice moves to the bench.
2. **Eve and Bob switch positions:** Eve becomes the fullback, and Bob becomes the left winger.
3. **Claire and Dave switch positions:** Claire moves to the right midfield, and Dave moves to the left midfield.
4. **Alice and Eve switch positions:** Alice becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the left midfielder.
5. **Alice and Bob switch positions:** Alice becomes the fullback, and Bob becomes the left winger.

Since Eve is the only one who stays in the left midfield position, she is playing left midfielder at the end of the match. 


**The answer is (D).** 
"
"Let's figure out what book Eve has at the end!

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Start:** Eve has *The Odyssey*.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob and Alice now have each other's books.
3. **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire and Dave now have each other's books.
4. **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve and Dave now have each other's books.
5. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob and Dave now have each other's books.
6. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve and Bob now have each other's books.

Since Eve and Bob swapped books, Eve's book is now the one Bob had.

Eve ends up with the green ball. 

The answer is **(E).** 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Alice's ball.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Claire's ball.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
5. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Claire's ball.

Notice that the balls are swapped in a way that keeps the original order of the balls. 

**Therefore, Bob has the purple ball.** 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave gets a new ball, and Claire gets a new ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets a new ball, and Bob gets a new ball.
3. **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve gets a new ball, and Dave gets a new ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets a new ball, and Bob gets a new ball.
5. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave gets a new ball, and Eve gets a new ball.

Since we know that Dave and Eve swap balls, and Eve gets a new ball, we can conclude that Dave must have the orange ball. 

**Therefore, the answer is (E).**

"Let's figure out what book Claire has at the end!

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
2. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means they trade books.
3. **Bob and Claire swap:** They trade books again.
4. **Dave and Claire swap:** They trade books again.
5. **Claire and Bob swap:** They trade books one last time.
6. **Alice and Eve swap:** They trade books.

"Let's look at the trades:

1. Alice and Bob switch positions.
2. Dave and Bob switch positions.
3. Alice and Claire switch positions.
4. Bob and Claire switch positions.
5. Alice and Eve switch positions.

This means that Alice starts as a fullback, then moves to the right winger position, then to the center midfielder position, then to the right winger position again, and finally to the center midfielder position. 

So, the final position for Alice is the center midfielder. 


**Answer: (D)**

"Let's figure out what book Claire has at the end!

Here's how we can track the trades:

1. **Start:** Alice has The Pearl, Bob has Catch-22, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave has Lolita, and Eve has Ulysses.

2. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire now has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Alice has The Pearl.

3. **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave has Lolita, and Alice has The Pearl.

4. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve has Catch-22, and Bob has Ulysses.

5. **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave has Lolita, and Bob has Ulysses.

6. **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob has Ulysses, and Claire has Lolita.


**So, Claire ends up with Lolita!**

"Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve starts with a purple ball, and Dave starts with a yellow ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a green ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.

Since Dave and Claire swap balls, and Dave starts with a yellow ball, we can conclude that Dave ends up with the yellow ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the gift at the end:

* **Start:** We have Alice (yellow), Bob (red), Claire (green), Dave (orange), and Eve (black).
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This doesn't change the colors, just who has the gift.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes the ownership of the gifts.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes the ownership of the gifts again.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This changes the ownership of the gifts.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This changes the ownership of the gifts.

**The key is that the gifts are swapped, not necessarily the colors.** 

**Therefore, Eve ends up with the black ball.** 

**The answer is (A).**

"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Alice and Eve:**  Alice starts with yellow, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow and Alice gets the green.
* **Bob and Dave:**  Bob starts with orange, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Dave gets the orange and Bob gets the purple.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob gets the green from Eve, and Eve gets the orange from Bob.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with red, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the red and Claire gets the green.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets the orange from Bob, and Alice gets the purple from Dave.

So, Dave ends up with the green present. 

The answer is **(B)**.

"Let's figure out what book Eve has at the end!

Here's how the trades go:

1. Eve starts with *Moby Dick*.
2. Eve and Dave swap, so Dave gets *Moby Dick* and Eve gets *Catch-22*.
3. Claire and Eve swap, so Claire gets *Moby Dick* and Eve gets *Ulysses*.
4. Dave and Bob swap, so Dave gets *The Odyssey* and Bob gets *Catch-22*.
5. Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets *Ulysses* and Alice gets *Moby Dick*.
6. Bob and Claire swap, so Bob gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *The Odyssey*.

So, Eve ends up with *Ulysses*. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is left winger, Bob is left midfielder, Claire is center midfielder, Dave is right winger, and Eve is striker.

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave moves to striker, Eve moves to right winger.
* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave moves to left winger, Alice moves to striker.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob moves to center midfielder, Alice moves to left winger.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire moves to left winger, Alice moves to center midfielder.

**So, at the end of the match, Alice is playing center midfielder.** 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final gift:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob's ball becomes Dave's present, and Dave's ball becomes Bob's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Dave's present, and Dave's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Eve's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's present, and Bob's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Dave's present.

**The final gift is the one that was originally Claire's.**

"Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:** Alice is with Melissa, Bob is with Patrick, Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Lola, and Eve is with Rodrigo.

2. **Alice and Claire switch:**  This means they swap partners.

3. **Dave and Eve switch:**  They also switch partners.

4. **Alice and Claire switch again:**  They switch partners again.

5. **Alice and Eve switch:**  They switch partners one last time.

6. **Dave and Bob switch:**  They switch partners.

**The final dance partner for Claire is Bob.** 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:**  Bob is with Sam, Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Jamie, Alice is with Rodrigo, and Eve is with Ophelia.

2. **Bob and Eve switch:**  They switch partners, so Bob is now with Ophelia, and Eve is now with Sam.

3. **Alice and Bob switch:**  Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Sam, and Bob is now with Ophelia.

4. **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve and Dave switch partners, so Eve is now with Izzi, and Dave is now with Alice.

5. **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Izzi, and Claire is now with Ophelia.

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Ophelia at the end.** 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Start:**  We know Bob is in the center midfielder position, Claire is the fullback, Dave is the striker, Alice is the benchwarmer, and Eve is the left winger.

* **Trades:**  We see Dave and Eve switch positions, then Dave and Claire switch positions, and then Eve and Dave switch positions again.  

* **Final Swap:**  The last trade is Bob and Alice switching positions. 

* **The Answer:**  Bob ends up on the bench. 


**Answer: (E) benchwarmer** 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Bob's blue ball.
2. **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice gets Dave's green ball and Dave gets Alice's blue ball.
3. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave gets Claire's red ball and Claire gets Dave's yellow ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets Bob's yellow ball and Bob gets Claire's blue ball.
5. **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob gets Eve's brown ball and Eve gets Bob's yellow ball.

Looking at the final swap, Eve ends up with the brown ball. 

**The answer is (D).** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.

Since each swap involves two people trading, and the colors are always changing, we can figure out who has the ball at the end. 


**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now with Alice, and Alice's present is now with Claire.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Bob.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Alice.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Bob.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Dave.

The key is to notice that the gifts are being swapped in a way that keeps the color of the present consistent. 

**Therefore, the answer is (A) yellow present.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* Alice and Eve swap balls. This means Eve gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Eve's ball.
* Dave and Claire swap balls. This means Claire gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Claire's ball.
* Dave and Eve swap balls. This means Eve gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* Claire and Eve swap balls. This means Eve gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Eve's ball.
* Bob and Eve swap balls. This means Eve gets Bob's ball, and Bob gets Eve's ball.

So, Eve ends up with all the balls that were originally held by the other players.  

**Therefore, the answer is (E) green ball.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Alice gets Bob's ball, and Bob gets Alice's ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Alice's ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Eve's ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Bob gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Bob's ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Claire's ball.

Notice that Alice's ball is the one that gets swapped the most.  

**The answer is (A) red ball.** 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Bob and Eve swap:**  Eve starts with a brown ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
2. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve now has the orange ball, and Dave has the brown ball.
3. **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave now has the brown ball, and Alice has the orange ball.
4. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has the orange ball, and Claire has the brown ball.
5. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has the brown ball, and Claire has the orange ball.

Since the final swap is between Bob and Claire, we can conclude that Bob has the orange ball. 


**Therefore, the answer is (E).** 
"
"Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:**  Bob is with Izzi, Claire is with Lola, Dave is with Sam, Eve is with Melissa, and Alice is with Ophelia.

3. **Claire and Eve switch:**  They switch partners again, so now Eve is with Izzi and Claire is with Sam.

4. **Bob and Dave switch:**  Bob and Dave switch partners, so Bob is now with Sam and Dave is with Izzi.

5. **Claire and Eve switch:**  They switch partners one last time, so Eve is now with Sam and Claire is with Izzi.

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Izzi at the end.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the gift:

* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her present, and Alice gives Eve her present.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Claire his present.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Alice her present.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her present, and Eve gives Alice her present.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Dave his present.

**The answer is (C) black ball.** 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with blue, Alice starts with yellow. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
2. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets the red ball, Claire gets the blue ball.
3. **Alice and Eve:** Alice gets the red ball, Eve gets the blue ball.
4. **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets the red ball, Claire gets the blue ball.
5. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets the red ball, Alice gets the blue ball.

Since Dave gets the blue ball in the last swap, he must have it at the end. 

**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is benchwarmer, Bob is fullback, Claire is left winger, Dave is right midfielder, and Eve is left midfielder.

* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave moves to left midfielder, Alice moves to right midfielder.

* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve moves to right midfielder, Bob moves to left winger.

* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire moves to right midfielder, Dave moves to left winger.

* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice moves to left winger, Eve moves to right midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice moves to fullback, Bob moves to left winger.

**Now, let's look at the final positions:**

* Alice is fullback
* Bob is left winger
* Claire is right midfielder
* Dave is left winger
* Eve is right midfielder

**So the answer is (C).** 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps to figure out who has the ball at the end.

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means Claire gets a new ball, and Eve gets a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

**The key is to remember that each swap changes the ball possession.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (E) orange ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

* **Start:** Alice has brown, Bob has black, Claire has green, Dave has purple, and Eve has yellow.

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means they switch gifts.  We don't know who gets which gift, but we know the order is important.

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  They switch gifts again.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch gifts.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts again.

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts.

**The key is to remember that the order of the swaps matters!** 


Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is striker, Dave is left midfielder, Eve is right winger, Alice is cheerleader, and Bob is goalkeeper.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes right winger, Eve becomes striker.

* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes left midfielder, Dave becomes striker.

* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes right winger, Claire becomes striker.

* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes goalkeeper, Alice becomes right winger.

* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes left midfielder, Dave becomes goalkeeper.

**So, Claire is now playing goalkeeper.** 


The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve starts with a brown ball, and Dave starts with a red ball. They swap, so Eve now has the red ball and Dave has the brown ball.
2. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice starts with an orange ball, and Dave now has the brown ball. They swap, so Alice now has the brown ball and Dave has the orange ball.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has the brown ball, and Claire starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Claire now has the brown ball and Alice has the yellow ball.

"Let's figure out what book Bob has at the end!

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Bob has Frankenstein, Dave has Hound of the Baskervilles, Claire has Ulysses, Alice has The Pearl, and Eve has Moby Dick.

2. **Bob and Dave swap:**  They switch books.  So, Bob gets Dave's book (Hound of the Baskervilles) and Dave gets Bob's book (Frankenstein).

3. **Bob and Claire swap:** They switch books again. Bob gets Claire's book (Ulysses) and Claire gets Bob's book (Frankenstein).

4. **Dave and Claire swap:** They switch books again. Dave gets Claire's book (Ulysses) and Claire gets Dave's book (Hound of the Baskervilles).

5. **Claire and Bob swap:** They switch books again. Claire gets Bob's book (Frankenstein) and Bob gets Claire's book (Ulysses).

6. **Alice and Eve swap:** They switch books. Alice gets Eve's book (Moby Dick) and Eve gets Alice's book (The Pearl).

**So, Bob ends up with Ulysses.**

**Answer: (E)**

"Let's break down the dance changes:

1. Eve and Bob switch partners.
2. Alice and Bob switch partners.
3. Dave and Eve switch partners.
4. Eve and Claire switch partners.
5. Alice and Claire switch partners.

This means Eve and Bob switched partners, then Alice and Bob switched partners, then Dave and Eve switched partners, then Eve and Claire switched partners, and finally Alice and Claire switched partners. 

At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Dave. 

**Answer: (C) Patrick.** 



"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Eve is with Melissa, Dave is with Lola, etc.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Eve is now with Patrick, Dave is with Lola.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Eve is now with Patrick, Dave is with Alice.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve is now with Dave, Alice is with Patrick.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Eve is now with Patrick, Bob is with Jamie.

**So, Eve is dancing with Patrick at the end.** 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out the final gift:

* **We know:**  We start with Alice (pink), Bob (brown), Claire (green), Dave (red), and Eve (purple).
* **Swaps:**  We have a series of swaps.  
* **The goal:** We need to figure out what gift Dave ends up with.

**The key is to think about how the colors are changing hands.**  

Let me know if you'd like to try another scenario! 


"
"Let's figure out who has what book at the end!

* **Start:**  Alice has Moby Dick, Bob has Catch-22, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave has Ulysses, and Eve has The Odyssey.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they switch books, so now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch books again, so now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books, so now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch books, so now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

**So, Dave ends up with Ulysses!** 


**The answer is (D).** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Alice and Dave:**  Alice's pink ball goes to Dave's orange ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave's orange ball goes to Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Alice's pink ball goes to Dave's orange ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob's red present goes to Claire's green present.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob's red present goes to Eve's black ball.

So, Eve ends up with the black ball. 


The answer is **(D) black ball**. 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Bob and Alice:**  Bob starts with a white present, and Alice starts with a green present. They swap, so the white present goes to Alice and the green present goes to Bob.
2. **Alice and Eve:** Alice now has the green present, and Eve has the yellow present. They swap, so the yellow present goes to Alice and the green present goes to Eve.
3. **Claire and Eve:** Claire has the black ball, and Eve has the yellow present. They swap, so the yellow present goes to Claire and the black ball goes to Eve.
4. **Alice and Dave:** Alice now has the green present, and Dave has the orange ball. They swap, so the orange ball goes to Alice and the green present goes to Dave.
5. **Bob and Eve:** Bob now has the white present, and Eve has the yellow present. They swap, so the yellow present goes to Bob and the white present goes to Eve.

**So, Claire ends up with the yellow present.** 


**The answer is (D).**

"Let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Claire and Alice switch:**  They switch partners.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** They switch partners.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** They switch partners.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** They switch partners.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** They switch partners again.

Looking at the changes, we can see that the final dance partner for Alice is Lola. 


**Answer:** (B) Lola 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire starts with a purple ball, and Dave starts with a red ball.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave starts with a red ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with a red ball, and Claire starts with a purple ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a red ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob starts with a red ball, and Eve starts with a purple ball.

Since Bob and Eve swapped, Bob must have the red ball.

"Let's figure out what book Alice has at the end!

Here's how the trades go:

1. **Start:** Alice has *The Odyssey*, Bob has *Frankenstein*, Claire has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Dave has *Moby Dick*, and Eve has *Lolita*.

2. **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets *Moby Dick* and Dave gets *Frankenstein*.

4. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Claire gets *Lolita*.

5. **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets *Lolita* and Claire gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

**So, at the end, Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.** 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Alice and Dave:**  Alice starts with an orange ball, and Dave starts with a white ball. They swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob starts with a black ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Bob gets the pink ball and Claire gets the black ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire now has the black ball, and Dave has the pink ball. They swap, so Claire gets the pink ball and Dave gets the black ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave now has the black ball, and Bob has the pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Bob gets the black ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice now has the white ball, and Eve has the red ball. They swap, so Alice gets the red ball and Eve gets the white ball.

So, Alice ends up with the red ball.

"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Alice and Dave:**  Alice starts with an orange ball, and Dave starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Dave gets the orange ball and Alice gets the yellow ball.
2. **Dave and Eve:** Dave now has the orange ball, and Eve has the yellow ball.
3. **Alice and Claire:** Alice now has the yellow ball, and Claire has the orange ball.
4. **Eve and Claire:** Eve now has the orange ball, and Claire has the yellow ball.
5. **Bob and Alice:** Bob now has the yellow ball, and Alice has the orange ball.

Since Dave started with the yellow ball, and the last swap involved Bob and Alice, Dave must have the orange ball at the end. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap, so Alice gets Bob's present and Bob gets Alice's.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Bob's present and Bob gets Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Dave's present and Dave gets Bob's.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Claire's present and Claire gets Alice's.

Now, let's look at the final gift.  Alice started with red, and then she got pink from Claire.  So, the final gift is the pink ball. 


The answer is **(E).** 
"
"Let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is left winger, Bob is striker, Claire is left midfielder, Dave is cheerleader, and Eve is goalkeeper.

* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire moves to striker, Bob moves to left midfielder.

* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire moves to cheerleader, Dave moves to left midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice moves to striker, Bob moves to left winger.

* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob moves to cheerleader, Dave moves to striker.

* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve moves to left winger, Bob moves to striker.

**So, at the end of the match, Bob is the striker, and Eve is playing left winger.** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Let's break down the trades:

1. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve moves to striker, Dave moves to right midfielder.
2. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave moves to striker, Bob moves to right midfielder.
3. **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave moves to cheerleader, Claire moves to striker.
4. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave moves to goalkeeper, Bob moves to center midfielder.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:** Dave moves to goalkeeper, Bob moves to striker.

So, Dave ends up playing **goalkeeper**. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire starts with a black ball, and Dave starts with a white ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice starts with a white ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a black ball, and Claire starts with a white ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with a white ball, and Bob starts with a black ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice starts with a black ball, and Bob starts with a white ball.

Since Eve and Claire swapped balls, and Eve started with a black ball, Eve must have the black ball at the end. 


**Answer: (A)**

1. Eve and Alice switch partners.
2. Dave and Claire switch partners.
3. Alice and Bob switch partners.
4. Claire and Eve switch partners.
5. Claire and Alice switch partners.

This means that after each switch, the dancers are swapping partners.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes left midfielder, Eve becomes striker.

* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes left midfielder, Bob becomes striker.

* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes benchwarmer, Claire becomes left midfielder.

* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes fullback, Dave becomes left midfielder.

**So, Dave is now playing left midfielder!** 


The answer is **(D)**.

* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.

The key is that each swap involves two people exchanging gifts.  

Let's think about what happens to the gifts:

* **Dave and Claire:**  They swap, so Dave now has Claire's gift.
* **Dave and Bob:**  They swap, so Dave now has Bob's gift.
* **Claire and Eve:**  They swap, so Claire now has Eve's gift.
* **Eve and Alice:**  They swap, so Eve now has Alice's gift.

**Therefore, Dave ends up with the gift that was originally Claire's.** 

**The answer is (E) pink ball.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Bob's ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Alice's ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Eve gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Eve's ball.

So, Eve ends up with the blue ball. 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Let's analyze the trades:

1. **Bob and Alice:**  Bob starts with a yellow ball, Alice starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the yellow ball.
2. **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with a white ball, Alice starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the white ball.
3. **Bob and Dave:** Bob has the orange ball, Dave has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob has the blue ball, Alice has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
5. **Claire and Bob:** Claire has the red ball, Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Bob gets the red ball.

**Therefore, Bob ends up with the red ball.** 


The answer is **(D).** 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Dave and Alice:**  Dave starts with a pink ball, Alice starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Dave gets the brown ball and Alice gets the pink ball.
2. **Alice and Claire:** Alice has the pink ball, Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the pink ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
3. **Claire and Bob:** Claire has the pink ball, Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the pink ball and Claire gets the blue ball.
4. **Eve and Bob:** Eve has the white ball, Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the white ball and Eve gets the blue ball.
5. **Alice and Dave:** Alice has the orange ball, Dave has the pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the orange ball and Alice gets the pink ball.

Looking at the final positions, Bob ends up with the white ball. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Alice and Claire switch partners.**  This means they swap partners.
* **Dave and Claire switch partners.** They swap partners again.
* **Dave and Bob switch partners.** They swap partners.
* **Dave and Claire switch partners.** They swap partners again.
* **Dave and Eve switch partners.** They swap partners.

**The final dance:**  We need to figure out who is dancing with whom at the end.

"Let's break down the trades:

1. Eve starts as the left midfielder.
2. Eve and Bob switch positions, so Eve becomes the striker and Bob becomes the left midfielder.
3. Eve and Dave switch positions, so Eve becomes the right midfielder and Dave becomes the left midfielder.
4. Alice and Eve switch positions, so Alice becomes the left midfielder and Eve becomes the right winger.
5. Bob and Claire switch positions, so Bob becomes the cheerleader and Claire becomes the right winger.

So, Eve ends up playing right winger. 


**Answer: (A)**

"Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:**  We know who's dancing with who to begin.
2. **Dave and Eve switch:**  Dave now dances with Izzi, Eve now dances with Patrick.
3. **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve now dances with Karl, Claire now dances with Rodrigo.
4. **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice now dances with Jamie, Dave now dances with Izzi.
5. **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire now dances with Rodrigo, Eve now dances with Jamie.

**The final answer is (D) Jamie.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Claire:**  They swap gifts, so Claire starts with a black ball and Dave starts with a white ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap gifts, so Eve starts with a green present and Dave starts with an orange ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap gifts, so Claire starts with an orange ball and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap gifts, so Alice starts with a black ball and Eve starts with an orange ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap gifts, so Dave starts with an orange ball and Bob starts with a black ball.

Since Claire started with a black ball, and the last swap involved Bob and Dave, Claire must have the orange ball. 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

1. **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so they end up with each other's balls.
2. **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Alice now has Claire's ball.
3. **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so they end up with each other's balls.
4. **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so Alice now has Bob's ball.
5. **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Alice now has Claire's ball.

Since Alice has swapped with Claire twice, she must have the blue ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Dave is the fullback, Eve is the right midfielder, Alice is the cheerleader, Bob is the benchwarmer, and Claire is the right winger.

* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes the right winger, Dave becomes the fullback.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the benchwarmer, Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the fullback, Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the right midfielder.
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes the right midfielder, Dave becomes the fullback.

So, Dave ends up playing fullback. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Let's figure out what book Bob has at the end!

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Bob has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob gets *The Pearl*.
3. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets *Lolita*, Dave gets *Moby Dick*.
4. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets *Moby Dick*, Dave gets *Lolita*.
5. **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets *Lolita*, Dave gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
6. **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob gets *The Odyssey*.

So, Bob ends up with *The Odyssey*. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are:

* Alice:  Benchwarmer
* Bob: Right Midfielder
* Claire: Cheerleader
* Dave: Striker
* Eve: Left Winger

Here's what happens:

1. Alice and Eve switch positions.
2. Claire and Alice switch positions.
3. Eve and Alice switch positions again.
4. Bob and Dave switch positions.
5. Dave and Eve switch positions.

So, let's see where everyone ends up:

* Alice is now a cheerleader.
* Eve is now a left winger.
* Bob is now a striker.
* Claire is now a left winger.
* Dave is now a right midfielder.

**The answer is (D) Striker.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Melissa, Claire is with Lola, Dave is with Sam, and Eve is with Izzi.

* **Claire and Dave switch:**  They switch partners, so Claire is now with Lola and Dave is now with Sam.

* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve and Bob switch partners, so Eve is now with Alice and Bob is now with Melissa.

* **Claire and Alice switch:**  Claire and Alice switch partners, so Claire is now with Dave and Alice is now with Bob.

* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve and Alice switch partners, so Eve is now with Dave and Alice is now with Sam.

**The final pairing:** Dave is now dancing with Sam. 


**So the answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that the gifts are being swapped, and we need to figure out who ends up with the green present.  

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start with the initial colors:** Alice is green, Bob is blue, Claire is red, Dave is yellow, and Eve is purple.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see how the colors change hands. 
* **Think about the pattern:**  The swaps are happening in pairs, and we need to see how the colors are being passed around. 

Let me know if you want to try another example! 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

1. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave gets a new ball, and Claire gets a new ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets a new ball, and Bob gets a new ball.
3. **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve gets a new ball, and Dave gets a new ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets a new ball, and Bob gets a new ball.
5. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave gets a new ball, and Eve gets a new ball.

Since Eve and Dave swap balls, Eve ends up with the black ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's look at the trades:

1. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave moves to the left midfield, and Bob moves to the fullback position.
2. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire moves to the right wing, and Eve moves to the left midfield.
3. **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve moves to the right wing, and Bob moves to the left midfield.
4. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice moves to the left midfield, and Claire moves to the right wing.
5. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice moves to the fullback position, and Dave moves to the left midfield.

Now, let's see where Eve ends up: Eve started as a left midfielder, then moved to the right wing, then back to the left midfield, and finally to the right wing again.  

**Eve is now playing right winger.**

**Therefore, Dave is dancing with Izzi.**

"Let's think about the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Claire's present. 
2. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Dave's present.
3. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Bob's present.
4. **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Eve's present.
5. **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Dave's present.

Now, let's look at the final gift.  Since Dave and Alice swapped, and Dave got Alice's present, the final gift must be Alice's present. 



**Answer: (E) red present** 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice starts with a brown ball, and Claire starts with a red ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve starts with a red ball, and Alice starts with a green ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire starts with a red ball, and Bob starts with a green ball.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire starts with a green ball, and Dave starts with a white ball.

**Therefore, Bob has the green ball at the end.** 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Let's figure this out!

We know the positions are:

* Alice: Cheerleader
* Bob: Benchwarmer
* Claire: Right Winger
* Dave: Fullback
* Eve: Right Midfielder

Here's what happens in the trades:

1. Claire and Dave switch positions.
2. Dave and Bob switch positions.
3. Alice and Bob switch positions.
4. Eve and Dave switch positions.
5. Alice and Dave switch positions.

The final position for Bob is Right Winger. 


**So the answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out what Eve has:

* **Alice and Bob:**  They swap gifts, so we don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap gifts, so we know Eve got Bob's gift.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap gifts, so we know Eve got Dave's gift.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap gifts, so we know Claire got Alice's gift.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap gifts again, so we know Eve got Bob's gift.

Eve got Bob's gift, then Dave's gift, and then Bob's gift again.

"Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:**  Claire is with Sam, Dave is with Patrick, Alice is with Izzi, Bob is with Lola, and Eve is with Jamie.

"
"Okay, let's break down the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is the goalkeeper, Bob is the striker, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the center midfielder, and Eve is the right midfielder.

* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve moves to the center midfielder position, and Dave moves to the right midfielder position.

* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the center midfielder.

* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

**So, Bob is now the center midfielder.  The answer is (B).**

"Let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is fullback, Bob is right midfielder, Claire is cheerleader, Dave is right winger, and Eve is center midfielder.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes right winger, Eve becomes cheerleader.

* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes cheerleader, Claire becomes right midfielder.

* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes right winger, Dave becomes center midfielder.

* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes center midfielder, Claire becomes right winger.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes center midfielder, Eve becomes right winger.

**So, at the end of the match, Claire is right winger, and Alice is center midfielder.** 



The answer is **(C) cheerleader**.

1. Alice and Dave switch partners.
2. Alice and Claire switch partners.
3. Alice and Eve switch partners.
4. Bob and Dave switch partners.
5. Dave and Claire switch partners.

This means that after each switch, the person who was originally dancing with someone else switches partners.  

So, after the last switch, Alice is dancing with Karl. 


The answer is **(C) Karl.** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's ball is now Dave's, and Dave's ball is now Claire's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's ball is now Bob's, and Bob's ball is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means Claire's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Claire's.

The pattern is that the balls are swapped in a cycle.  Since the game ends with Bob having the ball, we can conclude that Bob must have the ball that was originally held by Dave. 


**Therefore, the answer is (A) yellow ball.**

* **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Alice's present (green) and Alice gets Eve's present (yellow).
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Claire's present (black) and Claire gets Eve's present (yellow).
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Alice's present (green) and Alice gets Dave's present (orange).
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Bob's present (white) and Bob gets Eve's present (yellow).

Now, let's look at the final gifts:

* **Alice:**  She started with a green present and then got a white present, a yellow present, a black ball, and an orange ball. 

**The answer is (B) white present.**

3. **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve with Patrick, Dave with Helga.
4. **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob with Eve, Dave with Helga.
5. **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice with Dave, Bob with Helga.

So, Dave ends up with Helga. 

The answer is **(D)**.

* **Dave and Claire swap books.**  This means they both traded books.
* **Alice and Bob swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Eve and Alice swap books.** This means they both traded books.

Since they are trading books, we can assume that the books are being traded in a circular fashion. 

**Therefore, the answer is (E) Catch-22.**

"Let's look at the trades:

1. **Eve and Alice switch positions:** Eve moves to the left midfielder spot, and Alice moves to the center midfielder spot.
2. **Dave and Alice switch positions:** Dave takes over the right midfielder position, and Alice moves to the left winger position.
3. **Alice and Eve switch positions:** Alice becomes the center midfielder again, and Eve moves to the right midfielder position.
4. **Dave and Claire switch positions:** Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire moves to the left winger position.
5. **Bob and Claire switch positions:** Bob takes over the goalkeeper position, and Claire moves to the left winger position.

So, at the end of the match, Bob is playing **Goalkeeper**. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is striker, Bob is midfielder, Claire is fullback, Dave is right winger, and Eve is left midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Eve becomes striker, Alice becomes left midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes right winger, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve becomes right winger, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob becomes left midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve becomes right winger, Dave becomes left midfielder.

So, Eve ends up playing right winger. 

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* Alice starts as the goalkeeper.
* They swap positions with Claire, so Claire becomes the goalkeeper.
* Then Alice and Bob swap positions.
* Dave and Bob swap positions.
* Bob and Eve swap positions.
* Finally, Dave and Eve swap positions.

Looking at the positions, we can see that Alice ends up in the center midfielder position. 

**So the answer is (C).** 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a brown ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.

Since the game involves swapping balls, the person who ends up with the ball is the one who started with the ball that was swapped. 


**Therefore, Dave ends up with the orange ball.** 


The answer is **(B).** 
"
"Let's figure out who has which book at the end!

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Ulysses*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *The Odyssey*.

2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob gets *Lolita* and Alice gets *The Great Gatsby*.

3. **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Eve gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *The Odyssey*.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets *The Great Gatsby* and Bob gets *Lolita*.

5. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets *The Odyssey* and Eve gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

6. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire gets *The Odyssey* and Eve gets *Ulysses*.

**So, at the end, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring.**

4. **Eve and Bob:** Eve gives Bob his blue ball, Bob gives Eve her blue ball.
5. **Alice and Dave:** Alice gives Dave his brown ball, Dave gives Alice her pink ball.

Notice that Eve ends up with the blue ball. 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Bob switched partners, then Claire and Dave switched partners.  Then Eve and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Claire and Eve switched partners.  

This means that Dave is now dancing with Melissa. 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Eve is the benchwarmer, Alice is the striker, Bob is the fullback, Claire is the left midfielder, and Dave is the right midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the fullback, Bob becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the fullback, Bob becomes the striker.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the left midfielder, Eve becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes the left midfielder, Claire becomes the right midfielder.

"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Start:** Alice has pink, Bob has yellow, Claire has green, Dave has brown, and Eve has orange.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Eve's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Eve.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Eve.

The final gift Alice has is the orange ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Alice and Claire:**  They swap colors, so Alice gets blue and Claire gets red.
* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap colors, so Bob gets red and Alice gets white.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap colors, so Eve gets red and Alice gets pink.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap colors, so Claire gets brown and Dave gets blue.

Since the gifts are swapped in a way that each person ends up with the color they didn't start with, the final gift is the color that was not initially held by the person who received it. 



**The answer is (B) blue present.**

"Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Start:**  Everyone gets a new book.
2. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets The Pearl, Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
3. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Eve gets Catch-22.
4. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave gets The Pearl.
5. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets The Pearl, Eve gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
6. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Catch-22, Bob gets The Great Gatsby.

Now, let's see who has the book Eve ends up with. 



**Answer: (D) The Fellowship of the Ring** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* Eve and Claire swap: This doesn't change the colors.
* Claire and Bob swap: This swaps the colors.
* Bob and Alice swap: This swaps the colors again.
* Eve and Alice swap: This swaps the colors again.
* Bob and Dave swap: This swaps the colors again.

Since the last swap involved Bob and Dave, the final gift Bob has is the color that was in the last swap, which is the green present. 


**Answer: (E) green present.** 
"
"Let's figure out what book Eve has at the end!

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Start:** Eve has Ulysses.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gives Claire her book, and Claire gets it.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gives Eve her book, and Eve gets it.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gives Claire his book, and Claire gets it.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gives Bob his book, and Bob gets it.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gives Alice his book, and Alice gets it.

Eve's book is the one that is passed around the most. 

**Therefore, Eve has Ulysses at the end of the semester.** 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Let's break down the dance changes:

1.  **Dave and Bob switch partners:** This doesn't change who Claire or Eve are dancing with.
2.  **Claire and Dave switch partners:** This means Claire is now dancing with someone other than Dave.
3.  **Eve and Alice switch partners:** This means Eve is now dancing with someone other than Alice.
4.  **Claire and Eve switch partners:** This means Claire is now dancing with someone other than Eve.
5.  **Alice and Eve switch partners:** This means Alice is now dancing with someone other than Eve.

Since Claire and Eve switched partners, and Eve and Alice switched partners, we know that Claire is now dancing with someone other than Eve. 

**Therefore, Claire is dancing with Rodrigo.**

* **We start with:** Alice (purple), Bob (brown), Claire (green), Dave (red), Eve (pink).
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  We don't know who got what.

**The problem is that we don't know who has what after each swap.**  We can't figure out the final gift. 



**So the answer is none of the above.**

1. **Dave and Alice switch partners.**
2. **Eve and Alice switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Bob and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**

Notice that Eve and Alice switch partners twice.  This means Eve ends up with a new partner after the last switch.  Since Bob and Claire switch partners, Eve's final partner is with Helga. 


The answer is **(D) Helga.**

"Let's analyze the swaps:

1. Eve and Bob swap: Eve gets Bob's blue ball, and Bob gets Eve's green ball.
2. Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets Claire's brown ball, and Claire gets Dave's red ball.

3. **Claire and Dave switch:**  Claire now dances with Karl, and Dave dances with Helga.

4. **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice now dances with Helga, and Dave dances with Lola.

5. **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob now dances with Melissa, and Eve now dances with Sam.

**The final pairing is Claire with Sam.**

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes the colors again.

Since we're swapping gifts, the colors will change hands.  

**The answer is (A) red present.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Alice and Dave:**  Alice starts with white, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Dave gets the white present and Alice gets the purple present.
* **Claire and Dave:**  Claire starts with yellow, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Dave gets the yellow present and Claire gets the purple present.
* **Dave and Eve:**  Dave starts with purple, Eve starts with pink. They swap, so Eve gets the purple present and Dave gets the pink present.
* **Bob and Dave:**  Bob starts with green, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Dave gets the green present and Bob gets the purple present.
* **Dave and Claire:**  Dave starts with purple, Claire starts with yellow. They swap, so Claire gets the purple present and Dave gets the yellow present.

So, Claire ends up with the purple present.

2. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
3. **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Dave starts with a green ball.
4. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.

Looking at the final state, Bob has the brown ball.

* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire moves to the right, and Bob moves to the center midfield.

* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve moves to the center midfield, and Alice moves to the right.

* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire moves to the right, and Eve moves to the center midfield.

**So, Bob is now playing right winger.**

"Let's look at the trades:

1. Dave and Bob switch positions.
2. Claire and Dave switch positions.
3. Alice and Claire switch positions.
4. Claire and Dave switch positions again.
5. Eve and Alice switch positions.

Notice that Dave is always in the left midfielder position. 


**Answer: (C) left midfielder**

4. Alice and Dave swap: Alice gives Dave his ball, so Dave now has the green ball.
5. Bob and Alice swap: Bob gives Alice her ball, so Alice now has the red ball.

Since Bob gave Alice his ball, and Alice now has the red ball, Bob must have the red ball.

4. **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with a black ball, and Bob starts with a pink ball.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with a black ball.

Since Dave and Bob swapped, Dave ends up with the black ball. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Dave is the center midfielder.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes the cheerleader, Alice becomes the right midfielder.
* **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire becomes the striker, Fred becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes the striker, Fred becomes the fullback.
* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes the striker, Fred becomes the fullback.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes the goalkeeper, Gertrude becomes the striker.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes the center midfielder, Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes the goalkeeper, Dave becomes the center midfielder.

**So, Dave is now playing the goalkeeper.** 


The answer is **(D)**.

"
"Let's break down the ball swaps to figure out who has the ball at the end.

1. **Bob and Gertrude:**  Bob gives his pink ball to Gertrude, who then gives her ball to Bob. This means the pink ball is now with Bob.
2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives his green ball to Bob, who then gives his pink ball to Dave. This means the pink ball is now with Dave.
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Gertrude, who then gives her ball to Eve. This means the yellow ball is now with Eve.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his pink ball to Alice, who then gives her orange ball to Bob. This means the pink ball is now with Alice.
5. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Fred, who then gives his red ball to Eve. This means the yellow ball is now with Fred.
6. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives her brown ball to Dave, who then gives his green ball to Claire. This means the brown ball is now with Claire.

**Therefore, Eve has the red ball.** 


 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game!

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **The Swaps:**  We need to see how the balls are swapped.

**Let's look at the swaps:**

1. **Claire and Dave:**  Claire's ball is swapped with Dave's.
2. **Fred and Eve:** Fred's ball is swapped with Eve's.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob's ball is swapped with Claire's.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Eve's ball is swapped with Alice's.
5. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's ball is swapped with Gertrude's.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's ball is swapped with Dave's.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude's ball is swapped with Bob's.

**The key is to see how the ball distribution changes with each swap.** 

**Final Ball Distribution:**

"Let's break down the dance swaps to figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end.

1. **Start:** Alice is with Melissa, Bob is with Jamie, Claire is with Sam, Dave is with Izzi, Eve is with Karl, Fred is with Ophelia, and Gertrude is with Helga.

2. **Dave and Gertrude switch:**  Dave and Gertrude switch partners. This means Dave is now with Izzi, and Gertrude is now with Bob.

3. **Gertrude and Bob switch:**  Gertrude and Bob switch partners. This means Dave is now with Izzi, and Gertrude is now with Bob.

4. **Dave and Eve switch:**  Dave and Eve switch partners. This means Fred is now with Bob, and Eve is now with Alice.

5. **Fred and Bob switch:**  Fred and Bob switch partners. This means Eve is now with Alice, and Fred is now with Bob.

6. **Alice and Claire switch:**  Alice and Claire switch partners. This means Eve is now with Alice, and Fred is now with Bob.

**Therefore, Alice is dancing with Jamie.** 


**Answer:** (G) Jamie 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **Start:** Dave has a brown present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets Orange, Claire gets Brown.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets White, Bob gets Red.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Gertrude gets Pink, Fred gets Yellow.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets Black, Eve gets Brown.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets Yellow, Gertrude gets Pink.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets Black, Eve gets Pink.

**Final State:** Dave has the **yellow present**. 



 
"
"Let's figure out where Alice is playing at the end of the match!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is fullback, Bob is benchwarmer, Claire is cheerleader, Dave is left midfielder, Eve is right winger, Fred is left winger, and Gertrude is goalkeeper.

* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes left winger, Bob becomes right winger.
* **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes left winger, Bob becomes right winger.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes left midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes left midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes cheerleader, Claire becomes right winger.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes right winger, Bob becomes left winger.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes right winger, Eve becomes left winger.

**Final Positions:**

Alice is now playing **left winger**. 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's white gift goes to Eve, who has pink.
2. **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve's pink gift goes to Fred, who has orange.
3. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice's white gift goes to Bob, who has yellow.
4. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's red gift goes to Dave, who has black.
5. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's pink gift goes to Claire, who has red.
6. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob's yellow gift goes to Gertrude, who has purple.
7. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's orange gift goes to Alice, who has white.

So, Eve ends up with Alice's white present. 

**Answer:** (F) white present. 



"
"Let's figure out where Bob ends up!

* **Start:** Bob is the benchwarmer.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the left winger.
* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Fred becomes the left winger.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the goalkeeper, and Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes the cheerleader, and Gertrude becomes the striker.

**Final Positions:** Bob is the left winger. 


**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps to see who ends up with what ball. 

* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  This means Bob gets a white ball and Gertrude gets a brown ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets a yellow ball and Claire gets a pink ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets a yellow ball and Gertrude gets a pink ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets a pink ball and Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets a pink ball and Claire gets a green ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets a green ball and Claire gets a brown ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets a brown ball and Claire gets an orange ball.

Looking at the final swap, Eve ends up with the orange ball. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Gertrude starts as the goalkeeper.**
* **Gertrude and Bob switch positions.**  This means Bob becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Alice switch positions.** This means Eve becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch positions.** This means Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Dave and Fred switch positions.** This means Fred becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Claire and Eve switch positions.** This means Claire becomes the striker.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch positions.** This means Fred becomes the striker.

**So, Gertrude ends up as the striker.** 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game!

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who swaps with whom.

**Let's look at the swaps:**

1. **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
2. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
3. **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob her ball.
5. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
6. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
7. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

**The key is to see who ends up with the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with them.**

**Final Answer:** Dave ends up with the ball that was originally held by Alice.

**Now, let's look at the final dance:**  We know that Alice switched partners with Bob and then with Gertrude.  We also know that Dave and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Bob and Gertrude switched partners.  

**Therefore, Alice is dancing with Ophelia.**

"Let's think about the swaps and how they affect the gifts. 

* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Bob's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Claire's.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Gertrude's.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** This means Eve's present is now Fred's, and Fred's present is now Eve's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Fred's.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Fred's.

**The final gift Dave has is the black ball.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we can see:

* **Fred starts as a left midfielder.**
* **Claire and Fred swap positions.**
* **Alice and Fred swap positions.**
* **Eve and Alice swap positions.**
* **Claire and Fred swap positions again.**
* **Dave and Fred swap positions.**
* **Bob and Gertrude swap positions.**

Looking at the trades, Fred ends up back in the left midfielder position. 


**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Let's break down the dance swaps:

1. **Start:**  Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Jamie, etc.
2. **Claire and Eve switch:**  Claire is now with Dave, Eve is with Jamie.
3. **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice is now with Rodrigo, Fred is now with Izzi.
4. **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude is now with Jamie, Dave is now with Ophelia.
5. **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve is now with Rodrigo, Bob is now with Ophelia.
6. **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve is now with Jamie, Fred is now with Ophelia.
7. **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with Izzi, Claire is now with Jamie.

**Therefore, Claire is now dancing with Jamie.** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Gertrude starts as the center midfielder.  Then, she and Bob switch places.  Bob then switches with Eve.  Alice and Eve switch places.  Dave and Fred switch places.  Then, Gertrude and Bob switch places again.  Finally, Gertrude and Fred switch places. 

Looking at the final positions, Gertrude is now playing center midfielder. 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Let's break down the ball swapping to figure out who has the ball at the end.

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob her ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

Notice that the ball distribution changes with each swap.  The final ball distribution is:

* **Eve: (E) green ball** 



"
"Let's figure out who has the green present!

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Start:** We know Alice has blue, Bob has brown, Claire has orange, Dave has red, Eve has black, Fred has purple, and Gertrude has green.

2. **Claire and Gertrude Swap:**  They swap, so Claire gets the green and Gertrude gets the orange.

3. **Fred and Gertrude Swap:**  They swap, so Fred gets the orange and Gertrude gets the green.

4. **Gertrude and Eve Swap:** They swap, so Gertrude gets the black and Eve gets the green.

5. **Dave and Eve Swap:** They swap, so Dave gets the green and Eve gets the black.

6. **Dave and Alice Swap:** They swap, so Dave gets the black and Alice gets the green.

7. **Eve and Alice Swap:** They swap, so Eve gets the black and Alice gets the green.

8. **Bob and Dave Swap:** They swap, so Bob gets the green and Dave gets the black.


**Therefore, Bob has the green present!**

"Let's figure out who Claire is dancing with!

Here's what we know:

1. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.** This means they are now dancing with different people.
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.** This means they are now dancing with different people.
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners.** This means they are now dancing with different people.
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.** This means they are now dancing with different people.
5. **Claire and Fred switch partners.** This means they are now dancing with different people.
6. **Fred and Alice switch partners.** This means they are now dancing with different people.
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.** This means they are now dancing with different people.

**The only person who hasn't switched partners is Claire.** 

Therefore, Claire is dancing with **(C) Jamie**.

"Let's break down the ball swapping to figure out who has the yellow ball.

* **Fred and Dave:**  They swap, so Fred gets a pink ball and Dave gets a black ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap, so Gertrude gets a blue ball and Claire gets a yellow ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap, so Dave gets a brown ball and Bob gets a pink ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Claire gets a blue ball and Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
* **Alice and Fred:** They swap, so Alice gets a black ball and Fred gets a white ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so Bob gets a pink ball and Alice gets a black ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** They swap, so Eve gets a purple ball and Bob gets a pink ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the yellow ball.** 


**Answer: (C)**

"Let's break down the book swaps to figure out who has which book at the end.

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap books, so they both end up with a different book.

**The final answer is (E) Frankenstein.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see how the swaps affect the books.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Claire's book.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Eve's book.
5. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Fred's book.
6. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Dave's book.
7. **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Fred's book.

"Let's break down the ball swaps to figure out who has the ball at the end.

1. **Bob and Gertrude:**  Bob gives his pink ball to Gertrude, who then gives her pink ball to Bob. This means they've swapped.
2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives his green ball to Bob, who then gives his pink ball to Dave. This means they've swapped.
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Gertrude, who then gives her yellow ball to Eve. This means they've swapped.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his pink ball to Alice, who then gives her orange ball to Bob. This means they've swapped.
5. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Fred, who then gives his red ball to Eve. This means they've swapped.
6. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives her brown ball to Dave, who then gives his green ball to Claire. This means they've swapped.

**Final Ball:** Fred ends up with the blue ball. 

**Answer:** (E) 



"
"Let's break down the swapping to figure out who has the ball at the end. 

* **Eve and Dave:**  Eve and Dave swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve and Fred swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve and Dave swap again, so they each get a new ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve and Alice swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob and Alice swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude and Claire swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice and Dave swap, so they each get a new ball.

Eve ends up with the ball that was originally held by Dave. 



**Answer: (C) red ball.** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** We know everyone gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track who swaps with whom. 
* **The End:**  We need to figure out who has the book Alice ends up with.

Let's break it down:

1. **Gertrude and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has Gertrude's book, and Gertrude has Bob's book.
2. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has Eve's book, and Eve has Bob's book.
3. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has Bob's book, and Bob has Dave's book.
4. **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Claire now has Fred's book, and Fred has Claire's book.
5. **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice now has Claire's book, and Claire has Alice's book.
6. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has Bob's book, and Bob has Dave's book.
7. **Eve and Fred swap:** This means Fred now has Eve's book, and Eve has Fred's book.

**The Final Answer:**  We can see that Alice ends up with the book she received in the final swap with Claire.

"Let's figure out where Eve is playing at the end of the match!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Eve is cheerleader, Dave is goalkeeper, Fred is right winger, Gertrude is benchwarmer, Alice is striker, Bob is center midfielder, Claire is left winger.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire is now right winger, Dave is left winger.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave is now left winger, Gertrude is right winger.
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred is now left winger, Dave is right winger.
* **Eve and Gertrude trade:** Eve is now right winger, Gertrude is left winger.
* **Bob and Gertrude trade:** Bob is now left winger, Gertrude is right winger.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice is now right winger, Gertrude is left winger.
* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave is now left winger, Eve is right winger.

Eve ends up playing right winger. 


The answer is **(D)**.

"Let's break down the ball swaps to see who ends up with what color ball.

1. **Gertrude and Eve:**  Gertrude gives Eve her pink ball, and Eve gives Gertrude her red ball.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his purple ball, and Bob gives Fred his black ball.
3. **Fred and Eve:** Fred gives Eve her purple ball, and Eve gives Fred her red ball.
4. **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gives Gertrude her orange ball, and Gertrude gives Alice her pink ball.
5. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gives Gertrude her blue ball.
6. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave her pink ball, and Dave gives Gertrude her brown ball.
7. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gives Bob her orange ball, and Bob gives Alice her black ball.

Looking at the final exchange, Alice ends up with the black ball. 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Let's figure out what Alice has!

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Eve and Fred swap:**  Eve's black ball and Fred's pink ball are swapped.
2. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's green present and Bob's yellow present are swapped.
3. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire's purple present and Gertrude's blue present are swapped.
4. **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred's pink present and Claire's purple present are swapped.
5. **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob's yellow present and Fred's pink present are swapped.
6. **Gertrude and Alice swap:** Gertrude's blue present and Alice's brown present are swapped.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is fullback, Dave is goalkeeper, Eve is striker, Fred is right midfielder, Gertrude is left midfielder, Alice is benchwarmer, and Bob is cheerleader.

* **Gertrude and Claire trade:** Gertrude becomes left midfielder, Claire becomes fullback.

* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes striker, Eve becomes goalkeeper.

* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes right midfielder, Bob becomes fullback.

* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes left midfielder, Dave becomes striker.

* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes striker, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.

* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes striker, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.

* **Fred and Eve trade:** Fred becomes striker, Eve becomes left midfielder.

**So, Claire is now playing striker.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the gifts are being swapped, and we need to figure out who ends up with what.  

Here's how we can figure it out:

1. **Start with the initial colors:** We know Alice has red, Bob has blue, Claire has brown, Dave has orange, Eve has white, Fred has pink, and Gertrude has yellow.

2. **Look at the swaps:**  We have a series of swaps happening.  

3. **Think about the swaps:**  Each swap changes the color of the present. 

4. **The final result:**  Eve ends up with the yellow present. 

**Answer: (A)**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Dave is with Rodrigo.
* Eve and Claire switch partners.
* Fred and Gertrude switch partners.
* Eve and Bob switch partners.
* Eve and Alice switch partners.
* Dave and Bob switch partners.
* Dave and Eve switch partners.
* Alice and Dave switch partners.

Let's look at the final dance.  Dave is now dancing with Rodrigo. 


**Answer:** (C) Rodrigo 
"
"Let's break down the ball swapping to figure out who has what ball at the end.

* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her blue ball, and Dave gives Eve her red ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gives Eve her yellow ball, and Eve gives Gertrude her blue ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gives Bob his black ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his orange ball, and Fred gives Claire her black ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her green ball, and Claire gives Alice her orange ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives Fred his blue ball, and Fred gives Eve her black ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her blue ball, and Dave gives Eve her red ball.

**The final ball distribution:**

* Alice: **Green ball**
* Bob: **Brown ball**
* Claire: **Orange ball**
* Dave: **Red ball**

"Let's figure out where Bob is playing at the end of the match!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is in the center midfield position.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave moves to the right winger position, and Gertrude moves to the cheerleader position.
* **Dave and Fred trade:** Dave moves to the cheerleader position, and Fred moves to the right midfielder position.
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice moves to the cheerleader position, and Dave moves to the right midfielder position.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice moves to the right winger position, and Gertrude moves to the cheerleader position.
* **Bob and Eve trade:** Bob moves to the striker position, and Eve moves to the right midfielder position.
* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave moves to the right winger position, and Alice moves to the cheerleader position.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire moves to the right midfielder position, and Dave moves to the cheerleader position.

**Final Positions:**

* Bob is now playing striker. 


**Answer:** (D) 
"
"Let's break down the dance swaps to figure out who Claire is dancing with at the end.

1. **Start:** Claire is with Helga.
2. **Gertrude and Eve switch:**  Gertrude now dances with Rodrigo, Eve now dances with Fred.
3. **Fred and Dave switch:** Fred is now with Alice, Dave is now with Ophelia.
4. **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice is now with Dave, Bob is now with Claire.
5. **Gertrude and Bob switch:** Gertrude is now with Claire, Bob is now with Eve.
6. **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice is now with Dave, Claire is now with Rodrigo.
7. **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave is now with Claire, Alice is now with Rodrigo.
8. **Gertrude and Claire switch:** Gertrude is now with Rodrigo, Claire is now with Melissa.

So, Claire is dancing with Melissa. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Let's break down the dance swaps:

1. **Gertrude starts with Sam.**
2. **Alice and Gertrude switch partners.**  
3. **Dave and Gertrude switch partners.**
4. **Fred and Gertrude switch partners.**
5. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**
6. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
7. **Dave and Eve switch partners.**
8. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**

We can see that Gertrude ends up with Claire. 


The answer is **(F) Patrick.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:** We know Alice has a green present.
* **Gertrude and Eve:**  They swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Eve's.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Bob's.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Fred's.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's present and Bob gets Dave's.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's present and Alice gets Bob's.
* **Dave and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Dave's present and Dave gets Claire's.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Claire's present and Claire gets Alice's.

* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob now has the orange ball, and Eve has the pink ball.

**Final State:** Fred has the **(E) brown ball**. 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps to figure out who has which ball. 

* **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with a blue ball, Dave starts with a red ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with a red ball and Dave ends up with a blue ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with a blue ball, Fred starts with a white ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with a white ball and Fred ends up with a blue ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with a red ball, Dave starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with a blue ball and Dave ends up with a red ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with a blue ball, Alice starts with a purple ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with a purple ball and Alice ends up with a blue ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with a green ball, Alice starts with a purple ball. They swap, so Bob ends up with a purple ball and Alice ends up with a green ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude starts with a black ball, Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Gertrude ends up with a pink ball and Claire ends up with a black ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice starts with a purple ball, Dave starts with a red ball. They swap, so Alice ends up with a red ball and Dave ends up with a purple ball.

**Therefore, Fred has the white ball.**

"Let's break down the ball swapping to figure out who has the yellow ball at the end.

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her purple ball, and Eve gives Alice her yellow ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his pink ball, and Fred gives Dave his white ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gives Gertrude her purple ball, and Gertrude gives Alice her black ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire her white ball, and Claire gives Fred her blue ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gives Bob his white ball.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude gives Bob his black ball, and Bob gives Gertrude her brown ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gives Claire her black ball, and Claire gives Gertrude her blue ball.

**The final ball holder is Eve, who started with a yellow ball.** 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Let's figure out what Eve has!

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Eve and Bob:**  Eve gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Eve's yellow.
2. **Dave and Claire:**  Dave gets Claire's white present, and Claire gets Dave's green.
3. **Alice and Bob:**  Alice gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Alice's purple.
4. **Alice and Gertrude:**  Alice gets Gertrude's red present, and Gertrude gets Alice's purple.
5. **Claire and Bob:**  Claire gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Claire's white.
6. **Dave and Fred:**  Dave gets Fred's brown present, and Fred gets Dave's green.
7. **Bob and Eve:**  Bob gets Eve's yellow present, and Eve gets Bob's orange.

**Eve's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Eve's.**

**Therefore, Eve has the orange ball.**

"Let's figure out where Alice is playing at the end of the match!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is Left Midfielder, Bob is Goalkeeper, Claire is Benchwarmer, Dave is Cheerleader, Eve is Left Winger, Fred is Center Midfielder, and Gertrude is Striker.

* **Trades:**  We see a series of trades where players switch positions.  

* **The key is to keep track of who is playing where after each trade.**

Let's analyze the trades:

1. Dave and Gertrude trade: Dave becomes Striker, Gertrude becomes Cheerleader
2. Dave and Alice trade: Dave becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Cheerleader
3. Alice and Gertrude trade: Alice becomes Striker, Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder
4. Alice and Eve trade: Alice becomes Left Winger, Eve becomes Striker
5. Claire and Gertrude trade: Claire becomes Striker, Gertrude becomes Left Winger
6. Fred and Claire trade: Fred becomes Striker, Claire becomes Left Winger
7. Eve and Bob trade: Eve becomes Goalkeeper, Bob becomes Left Winger

**Final Position:**  Alice is now playing Left Winger. 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave starts with Melissa.  Here's what happens:

1. Alice and Bob switch partners.
2. Eve and Gertrude switch partners.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners.
4. Eve and Dave switch partners.
5. Bob and Alice switch partners.
6. Bob and Fred switch partners.
7. Bob and Eve switch partners.

Looking at the final dance, Dave is now with Rodrigo. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Start:** We know Alice has a red present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  This means Eve's present is now Gertrude's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Dave's present is now Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  This means Fred's present is now Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This means Bob's present is now Fred's, and vice versa.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:**  This means Gertrude's present is now Claire's, and vice versa.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave's present is now Claire's, and vice versa.

**The final gift Alice has is the one that was originally Dave's.** 

**Answer: (B) purple present.**

"Let's figure out where Claire is playing at the end of the match!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is in the center midfielder position.
* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave moves to fullback, Alice moves to goalkeeper.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave moves to fullback, Bob moves to goalkeeper.
* **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire moves to left winger, Fred moves to center midfielder.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred moves to left midfielder, Alice moves to striker.
* **Eve and Gertrude trade:** Eve moves to striker, Gertrude moves to left winger.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude moves to left midfielder, Dave moves to striker.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve moves to center midfielder, Claire moves to left winger.

**Answer:** Claire is now playing left winger.

"Let's break down the book swaps to figure out what Eve has at the end.

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Catch-22, Bob gets Frankenstein.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets The Odyssey, Claire gets Ulysses.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Gertrude gets The Odyssey.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice gets Catch-22, Fred gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Eve gets Moby Dick.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Ulysses, Bob gets Frankenstein.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Moby Dick, Bob gets Frankenstein.

**The key is to see who gets the book they end up with.**  Eve ends up with the book she received in the last swap. 

**Therefore, Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring.** 


**Answer: (F)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what book Alice has at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see which books get swapped and who swaps with whom.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Bob:** Swap books.
2. **Alice and Dave:** Swap books.
3. **Gertrude and Fred:** Swap books.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Swap books.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Swap books.
6. **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap books.
7. **Dave and Eve:** Swap books.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

Let me know if you'd like to see a more detailed breakdown of the swaps! 



**Answer:**  (E) The Great Gatsby 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person has a unique color ball.
* **Gertrude and Bob:**  Gertrude gives Bob her ball, and Bob gives Gertrude his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Bob her ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives Dave his ball, and Dave gives Claire her ball.

**The final ball that Eve has is the one that was originally held by the person who swapped with the person who had the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with the person who had

1. **Eve and Fred switch partners:** Eve now dances with Izzi, Fred now dances with Helga.
2. **Bob and Claire switch partners:** Bob is now with Ophelia, Claire is now with Izzi.
3. **Bob and Dave switch partners:** Bob is now with Ophelia, Dave is now with Helga.
4. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:** Gertrude is now with Izzi, Fred is now with Ophelia.
5. **Alice and Fred switch partners:** Alice is now with Izzi, Fred is now with Ophelia.
6. **Bob and Eve switch partners:** Bob is now with Ophelia, Eve is now with Izzi.
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** Gertrude is now with Izzi, Dave is now with Ophelia.

**The final dance swap is Gertrude and Dave switching partners.  This means Fred is now dancing with Ophelia.** 


The answer is **(F)**.

"Let's figure out what Eve has! 

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets red, Eve gets white.
2. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets orange, Gertrude gets pink.
3. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude gets black, Dave gets orange.
4. **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets brown, Fred gets red.
5. **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets white, Bob gets brown.
6. **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire gets yellow, Alice gets pink.
7. **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets orange, Bob gets yellow.

**The final swap is between Fred and Bob.  Since Fred got orange in the last swap, Eve must have the brown present.**

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Fullback, Fred becomes Goalkeeper
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Fullback
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Benchwarmer
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Goalkeeper
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper

**Alice ends up as the Goalkeeper.**

"Let's figure out what Dave ends up with!

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Bob and Gertrude:**  They swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's pink and Gertrude gets Bob's purple.
2. **Gertrude and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Gertrude's pink and Gertrude gets Dave's orange.
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** They swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's pink and Gertrude gets Eve's yellow.
4. **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's purple and Bob gets Dave's orange.
5. **Claire and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Claire's white and Claire gets Dave's orange.
6. **Fred and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Fred's brown and Fred gets Alice's blue.
7. **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Bob's purple and Bob gets Eve's yellow.

Now, let's look at the final gift distribution:

* **Dave:**  Dave started with an orange ball.  He then received a pink ball from Gertrude, then a white ball from Claire.  

**Therefore, Dave ends up with the (E) white present.**

"Let's break down the book swaps to figure out who has which book at the end.

* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book. This means they swapped books.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Eve's book. This means they swapped books.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Gertrude's book. This means they swapped books.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Gertrude's book. This means they swapped books.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book. This means they swapped books.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Bob's book. This means they swapped books.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book. This means they swapped books.

**The key is that Claire's book changes hands multiple times.**  This means she likely ends up with a book that was originally owned by someone else. 

**The answer is (A) The Great Gatsby.**

**So, Eve's final gift is the one she received from Fred, which is the green present.** 


**Answer: (E) green present** 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps to figure out who has which ball:

1. **Eve and Claire:** Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Eve now has a pink ball and Claire has a purple ball.
2. **Bob and Eve:** Bob starts with a black ball, and Eve now has a pink ball. They swap, so Bob now has a pink ball and Eve has a black ball.
3. **Claire and Alice:** Claire now has a pink ball, and Alice has a white ball. They swap, so Claire now has a white ball and Alice has a pink ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob now has a pink ball, and Alice has a white ball. They swap, so Bob now has a white ball and Alice has a pink ball.
5. **Dave and Eve:** Dave now has an orange ball, and Eve has a purple ball. They swap, so Dave now has a purple ball and Eve has an orange ball.
6. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred now has a green ball, and Gertrude has a brown ball. They swap, so Fred now has a brown ball and Gertrude has a green ball.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude now has a brown ball, and Claire has a pink ball. They swap, so Gertrude now has a pink ball and Claire has a brown ball.

**Therefore, Bob has the green ball.**

"
"Let's analyze the swaps to figure out who has which ball at the end. 

* **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve starts with a blue ball, and Gertrude starts with a black ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with a black ball and Gertrude ends up with a blue ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Fred ends up with an orange ball and Bob ends up with a yellow ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred starts with an orange ball, and Claire starts with a white ball. They swap, so Fred ends up with a white ball and Claire ends up with an orange ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with a black ball, and Fred starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with an orange ball and Fred ends up with a black ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred starts with a white ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Fred ends up with a pink ball and Claire ends up with a white ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with a green ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Alice ends up with an orange ball and Bob ends up with a green ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave starts with a pink ball, and Gertrude starts with a black ball. They swap, so Dave ends up with a black ball and Gertrude ends up with a pink ball.

"Let's think about the swaps:

* **We start with:** Alice (brown), Bob (yellow), Claire (blue), Dave (green), Eve (pink), Fred (black), Gertrude (purple).

* **The swaps happen:**  We don't know if any of the swaps change Fred's present. 

* **Fred's present stays the same** because no swap involves Fred.

"Let's break down the book swaps to figure out who has which book at the end.

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they both have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve and Alice have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice and Fred have a book they didn't originally get.

**The question is asking for Bob's book at the end.  The only way to figure that out is to look at the swaps and see who has the book Bob originally got.**

1. **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Lolita, Eve starts with Catch-22.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.
3. **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
4. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
5. **Alice and Fred:** Alice starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
6. **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with Catch-22, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.

**The key is to understand that the swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

**Therefore, the answer is (F) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has what:

* **Start with the basics:** We know everyone has a different color gift to begin with. 
* **Swap pairs:**  We have a bunch of pairs swapping gifts.  
* **Think about the possibilities:**  We need to figure out what happened to each gift after the swaps. 

**The problem is that we don't know what gifts were swapped, so we can't determine who has what.**

"Let's figure out who Gertrude is dancing with!

We know that Fred and Gertrude switch partners, then Dave and Claire switch partners, and so on.  This means that the partners are switching back and forth.  

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Gertrude is with Lola.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred is now with Lola, Gertrude is with someone else.
* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave is now with someone else.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave is now with someone else.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with someone else.
* **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice is now with someone else.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave is now with someone else.
* **Eve and Gertrude switch:** Eve is now with someone else.

**Therefore, Gertrude is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance.** 


The answer is (E). 



"
"Let's figure out where Dave ends up!

* **Start:** Dave is playing right midfielder.
* **Fred and Gertrude trade:** Fred becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes left winger.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes right midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes left winger, Fred becomes fullback.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes cheerleader, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes right midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes right winger, Claire becomes striker.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes right winger, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.

**Final Positions:** Dave is now playing right winger. 

**Answer:** (G) 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Alice starts with a white present.**
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets Eve's pink ball, so now Alice has a pink ball.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve's pink ball is now Fred's orange ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's yellow present.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's red present is now Dave's black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's pink ball is now Claire's red present.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob's yellow present is now Gertrude's purple present.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's orange ball is now Alice's white present.

**So, Alice ends up with the white present.** 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Let's break down the dance swaps to figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end.

1. **Start:** Dave is with Karl, Eve is with Sam, etc.
2. **Alice and Eve switch:**  This means Eve is now with Dave.
3. **Dave and Fred switch:**  This means Dave is now with Izzi.
4. **Eve and Claire switch:** This means Eve is now with Karl.
5. **Dave and Gertrude switch:** This means Dave is now with Izzi.
6. **Dave and Bob switch:** This means Dave is now with Izzi.

"Let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Here's what we can see:

1. **Start:**  Bob is with Karl, Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Jamie, Eve is with Helga, Fred is with Rodrigo, and Gertrude is with Ophelia.

2. **Claire and Eve switch:**  Claire is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Helga.

3. **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Gertrude.

4. **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude is now with Ophelia, and Dave is with Jamie.

5. **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve is now with Karl, and Bob is with Helga.

6. **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Ophelia.

7. **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with Izzi, and Claire is with Helga.

8. **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred is now with Ophelia, and Gertrude is with Rodrigo.

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Izzi.**

"Let's break down the dance swaps:

1.  **Dave starts with Patrick.**
2.  **Eve and Dave switch partners.**
3.  **Fred and Eve switch partners.**
4.  **Alice and Gertrude switch partners.**
5.  **Dave and Bob switch partners.**
6.  **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
7.  **Alice and Gertrude switch partners.**
8.  **Bob and Claire switch partners.**

So, after all the swaps, Dave is now dancing with **Bob**. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has:

* **Start:**  We know everyone has a different color gift.
* **Fred and Alice:**  They swap gifts.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap gifts.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap gifts.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** They swap gifts.
* **Eve and Bob:** They swap gifts.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** They swap gifts.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap gifts.

**The key is that each pair of people swaps gifts.**  

Let's think about who would have the white present at the end. 



**Answer: (G) white present** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Eve has at the end:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know everyone gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are swapped around. 
* **Think about the end:**  We need to figure out who ends up with what book.

Let's go through the swaps and see what happens:

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes the ownership of The Great Gatsby and The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This changes the ownership of The Pearl and The Great Gatsby.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** This changes the ownership of The Fellowship of the Ring and Lolita.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes the ownership of The Pearl and The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes the ownership of Lolita and Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This changes the ownership of Ulysses and The Pearl.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This changes the ownership of Lolita and Catch-22.

**The answer is (E) Hound of the Baskervilles.**

"Let's figure out what Claire has!

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Start:**  We know everyone has a different color gift.
2. **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes Fred's present to purple and Eve's present to green.
3. **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes Bob's present to pink and Dave's present to orange.
4. **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to white and Alice's present to pink.
5. **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes Bob's present to black and Claire's present to orange.
6. **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes Fred's present to green and Eve's present to purple.
7. **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes Dave's present to brown and Claire's present to black.
8. **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This changes Fred's present to brown and Gertrude's present to green.

**The final gift swap leaves Claire with the brown present.**

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is a right winger.
* **Trades:**  We see a bunch of trades happen, but the key is to see who ends up in what position. 

* **Final Position:**  Claire ends up as the center midfielder. 


**Answer:** (D) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has what present:

* **Start with the basics:** We know the initial colors of each person's present.
* **Swap 1:** Dave and Eve swap gifts. This means they each got a new present.
* **Swap 2:** Fred and Dave swap gifts. This means they each got a new present.
* **Swap 3:** Claire and Fred swap gifts. This means they each got a new present.
* **Swap 4:** Dave and Gertrude swap gifts. This means they each got a new present.
* **Swap 5:** Bob and Fred swap gifts. This means they each got a new present.
* **Swap 6:** Fred and Alice swap gifts. This means they each got a new present.
* **Swap 7:** Alice and Bob swap gifts. This means they each got a new present.

**The problem is that we don't know what gifts were swapped, so we can't determine who has what present.**

"Let's figure out who Eve is dancing with! 

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.
5. **Claire and Fred switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.
6. **Fred and Alice switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.

"Let's break down the dance swaps:

1. Eve and Claire switch partners.
2. Fred and Gertrude switch partners.
3. Eve and Bob switch partners.
4. Eve and Alice switch partners.
5. Dave and Bob switch partners.
6. Dave and Eve switch partners.
7. Alice and Dave switch partners.

This means that after each swap, the dancers change partners.  

At the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Dave. 

So the answer is **(A) Rodrigo.** 



"
"Let's break down the dance swaps:

1. **Start:** Fred is with Lola.
2. **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave now dances with Lola, Bob now dances with Izzi.
3. **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire now dances with Rodrigo, Bob now dances with Izzi.
4. **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve now dances with Rodrigo, Bob now dances with Izzi.
5. **Gertrude and Bob switch:** Gertrude now dances with Izzi, Bob now dances with Izzi.
6. **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire now dances with Rodrigo, Dave now dances with Izzi.
7. **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice now dances with Izzi, Gertrude now dances with Rodrigo.
8. **Bob and Fred switch:** Bob now dances with Izzi, Fred now dances with Rodrigo.

Since Bob and Fred switched partners, Fred is now dancing with Rodrigo. 


The answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has:

* **Start:** We know everyone has a different color gift.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This doesn't change anything.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred's gift is now Bob's, and Bob's gift is Fred's.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This changes the colors.

**The final gift Gertrude has is the purple present.** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Here's what we can see:

* **Start:** Bob is with Sam, Claire is with Jamie, Dave is with Ophelia, Eve is with Helga, Fred is with Izzi, and Gertrude is with Rodrigo.
* **Bob and Claire switch:**  They switch partners, so now Bob is with Jamie and Claire is with Ophelia.
* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred is now with Ophelia, and Alice is with Bob.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob is now with Ophelia, and Dave is with Claire.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice is now with Ophelia, and Bob is with Claire.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Eve is with Claire.
* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice is now with Helga, and Dave is with Rodrigo.

**Therefore, Claire is dancing with Jamie.** 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has what:

* **Start with the initial colors:** We know Alice has pink, Bob has yellow, Claire has white, Dave has blue, Eve has purple, Fred has red, and Gertrude has orange.

* **Swaps:**  We have a bunch of swaps happening.  Each swap changes the gifts of the two people involved. 

* **The problem:**  We don't know what happens to the gifts after all the swaps. 

**So, we can't determine who has what gift.**

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Alice and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Eve's ball.

**Fred ends up with the green ball.**

"Let's break down the book swaps to figure out who has what at the end!

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This changes who has The Pearl and Frankenstein.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** This changes who has The Odyssey and Frankenstein.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes who has The Odyssey and The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes who has Hound of the Baskervilles and Lolita.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes who has Ulysses and The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes who has Hound of the Baskervilles and Frankenstein.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This changes who has Lolita and Hound of the Baskervilles.

**The final swap means Bob has the book that was originally owned by Alice and then swapped with Bob.** 

**The answer is (F) Hound of the Baskervilles.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Start:** Alice has green, Bob has orange, Claire has black, Dave has blue, Eve has pink, Fred has purple, and Gertrude has yellow.

* **Fred and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.

Since we know Alice's present is swapped multiple times, the final color she has is the color she had at the start of the swap.

"Let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Here's what we can see:

* **Bob and Fred switch partners:** This means Bob is now with Melissa, and Fred is now with Claire.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Dave, and Alice is now with Bob.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means Gertrude is now with Dave, and Alice is now with Fred.
* **Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Sam, and Bob is now with Izzi.
* **Dave and Fred switch partners:** This means Dave is now with Melissa, and Fred is now with Eve.
* **Eve and Alice switch partners:** This means Eve is now with Dave, and Alice is now with Sam.

Looking at the final dance, we see that Claire is now dancing with Sam. 


**Answer: (A) Sam** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:** Alice has a white present.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This changes Fred's present to purple and Eve's present to green.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes Bob's present to pink and Dave's present to orange.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to white and Alice's present to pink.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes Bob's present to black and Claire's present to orange.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes Fred's present to green and Eve's present to purple.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes Dave's present to brown and Claire's present to black.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This changes Fred's present to brown and Gertrude's present to green.

**Final Gift:**  The only gift that remains unchanged is Alice's. 

**Answer:** (F) orange ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know everyone got a new book at the beginning of the semester.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see which books were swapped. 
* **Think about the swaps:**  We need to figure out who got which book after the swaps.

Let me know if you want to try to figure it out together! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has what after all the swaps:

* **Start:** We know Alice has pink, Bob has brown, Claire has red, Dave has blue, Eve has white, Fred has orange, and Gertrude has black.

* **Alice and Dave Swap:**  This means Dave now has Alice's pink, and Alice now has Dave's blue.
* **Claire and Dave Swap:**  This means Dave now has Claire's red, and Claire now has Dave's blue.
* **Fred and Gertrude Swap:**  This means Gertrude now has Fred's orange, and Fred now has Gertrude's black.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:**  This means Gertrude now has Eve's white, and Eve now has Gertrude's black.
* **Eve and Alice Swap:**  This means Alice now has Eve's white, and Eve now has Alice's pink.
* **Dave and Bob Swap:**  This means Bob now has Dave's blue, and Dave now has Bob's blue.
* **Gertrude and Dave Swap:**  This means Dave now has Gertrude's black, and Gertrude now has Dave's blue.

**The final result is that Gertrude has the black ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we can see:

* **Alice starts as LW**
* **Bob starts as FB**
* **Claire starts as CM**
* **Dave starts as RW**
* **Eve starts as Bench**
* **Fred starts as Cheer**
* **Gertrude starts as LM**

Let's see how the positions change:

1. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice becomes FB, Bob becomes LW
2. **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave becomes Bench, Eve becomes RW
3. **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred becomes CM, Bob becomes FB
4. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice becomes RW, Eve becomes LM
5. **Claire and Fred swap:** Claire becomes FB, Fred becomes CM
6. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes RW, Bob becomes LM

7. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob becomes LM, Gertrude becomes FB

**Gertrude ends up as the FB** 


So the answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is center midfielder, Bob is striker, Claire is left winger, Dave is cheerleader, Eve is fullback, Fred is right winger, and Gertrude is benchwarmer.

* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes left winger, Claire becomes center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes striker, Bob becomes fullback.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Alice becomes fullback.
* **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire becomes right winger, Fred becomes center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes cheerleader, Dave becomes fullback.
* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes right winger, Fred becomes center midfielder.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes striker, Bob becomes right winger.

**Final Positions:**

* Alice: Fullback
* Bob: Striker
* Claire: Right Winger
* Dave: Cheerleader
* Eve: Center Midfielder
* Fred: Striker
* Gertrude: Benchwarmer

**Answer:** (F) right winger 



"
"Let's break down the ball swapping:

1. **Alice and Fred:**  They swap, so Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
2. **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
3. **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
4. **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
5. **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
6. **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
7. **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

Looking at the final result, Eve has the blue ball. 

**Answer: (C)** 
"

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who traded with whom.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Fred and Dave swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
2. **Eve and Fred swap:**  This means Eve had a book Fred traded.
3. **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
5. **Eve and Bob swap:**  This means Eve had a book Bob traded.
6. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
7. **Fred and Claire swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.

**The key is to understand that the swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

**Here's how to analyze the swaps:**

* **Fred and Dave:**  They swapped books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Fred:**  Eve had a book Fred traded.
* **Gertrude and Bob:**  They swapped books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Alice and Bob:**  They swapped books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Bob:**  Eve had a book Bob traded.
* **Dave and Alice:**  They swapped books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Fred and Claire:**  They swapped books, so they both had a book they traded.

**The swaps are happening in a circular fashion, so we can deduce that the final book ownership is:**

* **Gertrude:**  Ulysses
* **Bob:**  The Great Gatsby
* **Dave:**  The Odyssey
* **Alice:**  Moby Dick
* **Eve:**  The Pearl
* **Fred:**  Frankenstein
* **Claire:**  Hound of the Baskervilles

"Let's break down the trading! 

Here's what we know:

* **Everyone starts with a new book:**  This means the initial distribution is important.
* **Swaps happen:**  We need to see how the swaps affect the books.

Since we don't have any information about the order of the swaps, we can't determine who has which book at the end. 

**Therefore, we can't determine the answer.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to see how the balls are swapped to figure out who has which one at the end.  

* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets Alice's blue ball, Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets Gertrude's green ball, Gertrude gets Claire's brown ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets Dave's purple ball, Dave gets Bob's red ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's blue ball, Alice gets Eve's black ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets Eve's black ball, Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.

**Final State:** Claire ends up with the brown ball. 

**Answer:** (D)

* **Gertrude and Bob:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.

* **Fred and Bob:** Swap, so Bob gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Bob's ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Swap, so Alice gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Alice's ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap, so Gertrude gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Gertrude's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Swap, so Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap, so Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Fred is the cheerleader, Gertrude is the goalkeeper, Alice is the right midfielder, Bob is the fullback, Claire is the center midfielder, Dave is the left midfielder, and Eve is the striker.

* **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes the fullback, Bob becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the fullback, Alice becomes the striker.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Dave and Fred trade:** Dave becomes the cheerleader, Fred becomes the left midfielder.
* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes the striker, Eve becomes the left midfielder.
* **Fred and Gertrude trade:** Fred becomes the striker, Gertrude becomes the left midfielder.

**Final Position:** Fred is now the left midfielder. 


So the answer is **(D) left midfielder**. 
"
"Let's break down the trades to see who ends up with what ball.

* **Alice and Fred:** Alice gives Fred her blue ball, and Fred gets Alice's blue ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, and Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, and Bob gets Claire's black ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her blue ball, and Alice gets Dave's blue ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his orange ball, and Fred gets Bob's orange ball.

**The Final Ball:**

Dave is the only one who has a ball that hasn't been traded. 

**Therefore, the answer is (A) brown ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's look at the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave started with a different book than Gertrude.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave started with a different book than Claire.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob started with different books.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire started with different books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This means Alice and Gertrude started with different books.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob and Alice started with different books.

**The key is to keep track of who started with which book.** 

**Here's a possible solution:**

1. **Gertrude:** Frankenstein
2. **Fred:** The Pearl
3. **Dave:** The Odyssey
4. **Claire:** The Great Gatsby
5. **Alice:** Hound of the Baskervilles
6. **Bob:** Lolita
7. **Eve:** Ulysses

"Let's figure out where Claire is playing at the end of the match!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is playing Fullback.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Striker, Alice becomes Left Winger.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes Cheerleader, Bob becomes Striker.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes Striker, Alice becomes Center Midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes Benchwarmer, Dave becomes Right Winger.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes Right Winger, Eve becomes Center Midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes Center Midfielder, Bob becomes Right Winger.

**Answer:** Claire is now playing Center Midfielder.

"Let's break down the dance swaps to figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end.

1. **Dave and Bob switch partners:** This means Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.
2. **Eve and Claire switch partners:** Eve and Claire are now dancing with each other.
3. **Claire and Gertrude switch partners:** Claire and Gertrude are now dancing with each other.
4. **Alice and Eve switch partners:** Alice and Eve are now dancing with each other.
5. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** Gertrude and Alice are now dancing with each other.
6. **Eve and Fred switch partners:** Eve and Fred are now dancing with each other.
7. **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:** Gertrude and Claire are now dancing with each other.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Ophelia.

"Let's break down the ball swapping to figure out who has the yellow ball.

1. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gives Eve her orange ball.
2. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice his yellow ball, and Alice gives Dave his brown ball.
3. **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his white ball, and Dave gives Fred his yellow ball.
4. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his black ball, and Fred gives Bob his white ball.
5. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives Dave his red ball, and Dave gives Claire his yellow ball.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob gives Dave his black ball, and Dave gives Bob his yellow ball.

**The final ball distribution:**

* Eve:  **Pink ball** (from Gertrude)
* Bob: **Black ball** (from Fred)
* Claire: **Red ball** (from Dave)
* Dave: **Yellow ball** (from Alice)
* Fred: **White ball** (from Bob)
* Gertrude: **Orange ball** (from Eve)
* Alice: **Brown ball** (from Dave)


**Therefore, the answer is (E) yellow ball.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps!

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Eve and Gertrude:**  They swap books, so Eve now has Gertrude's book.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap books, so Bob now has Eve's book.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap books, so Alice now has Gertrude's book.
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap books, so Claire now has Eve's book.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap books, so Alice now has Eve's book.
* **Fred and Alice:** They swap books, so Fred now has Alice's book.
* **Eve and Dave:** They swap books, so Dave now has Eve's book.

**Eve ends up with Dave's book.** 


**So the answer is (B) Catch-22.** 



"
"Let's figure out where Eve ends up!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Eve is striker, Fred is left midfielder, Claire is center midfielder, Dave is fullback, Bob is cheerleader, Alice is left winger, and Gertrude is benchwarmer.

* **Trades happen:**  We see a few trades happen throughout the game.  

* **Eve's position changes:**  Eve and Claire trade positions, and then Eve and Fred trade positions. 

* **Final Position:**  Eve ends up playing striker. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Let's figure out where Alice is playing at the end of the match!

Here's what we know:

* Alice starts as a Left Midfielder.
* Alice and Dave trade positions twice.
* Alice and Claire trade positions.
* Claire and Fred trade positions.
* Dave and Eve trade positions.
* Gertrude and Bob trade positions.

Let's look at the changes:

* Alice moves to Center Midfielder, then Left Winger.
* Dave moves to Left Midfielder, then Center Midfielder.
* Claire moves to Left Winger, then Center Midfielder.
* Fred moves to Center Midfielder, then Left Winger.
* Dave moves to Cheerleader, then Center Midfielder.
* Gertrude moves to Striker, then Fullback.

So, Alice is now playing Left Winger. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's analyze the swaps to figure out who has which ball. 

* **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with a blue ball, Dave starts with a red ball. They swap, so Eve gets the red ball and Dave gets the blue ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve gets the blue ball, Fred gets the blue ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gets the red ball, Dave gets the blue ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gets the blue ball, Alice gets the red ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gets the green ball, Alice gets the red ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets the black ball, Claire gets the pink ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice gets the red ball, Dave gets the blue ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the pink ball.**

**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:**
    * Bob: Right Winger
    * Claire: Center Midfielder
    * Dave: Fullback
    * Eve: Left Winger
    * Fred: Cheerleader
    * Gertrude: Striker

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave becomes Left Winger, Eve becomes Fullback
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Fullback
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes Striker, Gertrude becomes Center Midfielder
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes Fullback, Dave becomes Right Winger
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes Right Winger, Dave becomes Center Midfielder
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Right Winger

**So, Bob is now playing Right Winger.** 


**Answer: (G)**

"Let's break down the ball swaps:

1. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets Eve's yellow ball, and Eve gets Alice's purple ball.
2. **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets Fred's white ball, and Fred gets Dave's pink ball.
3. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets Gertrude's black ball, and Gertrude gets Alice's purple ball.
4. **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's blue ball, and Claire gets Fred's white ball.
5. **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob gets Fred's white ball, and Fred gets Bob's brown ball.
6. **Gertrude and Bob swap:** Gertrude gets Bob's brown ball, and Bob gets Gertrude's black ball.
7. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's blue ball, and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.

Notice that the only ball that remains unchanged is the purple ball. 


**Answer: (C)**

"Let's break down the dance swaps:

1. **Eve starts with Jamie.**
2. **Fred and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
4. **Dave and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**
6. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
7. **Alice and Fred switch partners.**
8. **Fred and Claire switch partners.**

The final dance swap is Fred and Claire switching partners.  This means Eve is now dancing with Jamie. 

So the answer is **(G) Jamie**. 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave starts with orange.**
* **Dave and Fred swap, so Dave gets yellow and Fred gets orange.**
* **Bob and Fred swap, so Bob gets yellow and Fred gets orange.**
* **Gertrude and Dave swap, so Gertrude gets orange and Dave gets blue.**
* **Dave and Claire swap, so Dave gets pink and Claire gets orange.**
* **Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets purple and Eve gets orange.**
* **Claire and Bob swap, so Claire gets black and Bob gets purple.**
* **Dave and Alice swap, so Dave gets white and Alice gets black.**

Dave ends up with the blue present. 


**Answer: (A)**

6. **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob is now with Ophelia, and Alice is with Rodrigo.

7. **Bob and Fred switch:** Bob is now with Ophelia, and Fred is with Sam.

**The final dance:**  We know that Claire is now with Rodrigo. 


**Answer:** (C) Melissa. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the pink ball:

* **Start:** We know everyone has a different color gift.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  This changes Bob's present to red and Eve's present to white.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This changes Claire's present to orange and Gertrude's present to pink.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to black and Dave's present to orange.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** This changes Eve's present to brown and Fred's present to red.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to white and Bob's present to brown.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This changes Claire's present to yellow and Alice's present to pink.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to orange and Bob's present to white.

**Final State:**

Gertrude now has the **(B) pink ball**. 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps to figure out who has the ball at the end.

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps!

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book to begin with.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see which books get swapped and who gets them.

**Let's look at the swaps:**

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with The Great Gatsby, Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave starts with The Odyssey.
5. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Gertrude starts with Lolita.
6. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with The Odyssey, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.
7. **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Eve starts with Lolita.

**The Final Swap:** Fred and Eve swap books, so Eve ends up with Frankenstein.

**Answer:**  Eve has Frankenstein.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Bob has:

* **Start:** We know Bob has a yellow present.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see how the swaps affect the colors. 

Let's go through each swap:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Dave's.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Claire's.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes Eve's present to Claire's, and Claire's present to Eve's.
4. **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
5. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
6. **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Gertrude's.
7. **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to Bob's, and Bob's present to Fred's.

**The final gift:**  We need to figure out what Bob has.

"Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Bob starts with Frankenstein.**
2. **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This doesn't change Bob's book.
3. **Bob and Fred swap:** This means Fred now has Frankenstein.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has Frankenstein.
5. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice now has Frankenstein.
6. **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice now has The Fellowship of the Ring.

"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Swap, so Fred ends up with Bob's ball.

**The final ball Fred has is the pink ball.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gets Ulysses, Gertrude gets The Odyssey.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets The Odyssey, Eve gets The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets The Odyssey, Gertrude gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, Eve gets Catch-22.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Alice gets The Odyssey.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets The Odyssey, Alice gets Catch-22.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Dave gets The Odyssey.

**The final swap leaves Alice with The Great Gatsby.** 


**Answer: (E)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Fred is right winger, Bob is center midfielder, Claire is left midfielder, Dave is fullback, Eve is benchwarmer, Alice is left winger, and Gertrude is cheerleader.

* **Gertrude and Eve trade:**  Gertrude becomes benchwarmer, Eve becomes left midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes fullback, Dave becomes left midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Claire trade:** Gertrude becomes left midfielder, Claire becomes fullback.
* **Bob and Eve trade:** Bob becomes left midfielder, Eve becomes fullback.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes right winger, Alice becomes left midfielder.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes right winger, Bob becomes center midfielder.

**So, Fred is now playing right winger.** 


**Answer: (E)**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:** We know Alice has a blue present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Eve's.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Fred's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Gertrude's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Claire's.

**The only way to get to Alice's present is to figure out what Claire's present is at the end.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has:

* **Start:** Gertrude has the orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob's green gift goes to Alice, and Alice's green gift goes to Bob.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire's purple gift goes to Dave, and Dave's red gift goes to Claire.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob's white gift goes to Gertrude, and Gertrude's orange ball goes to Bob.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred's yellow gift goes to Bob, and Bob's white gift goes to Fred.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire's purple gift goes to Eve, and Eve's blue gift goes to Claire.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice's green gift goes to Bob, and Bob's white gift goes to Alice.

**The key is to note that the gifts are swapped in pairs.**  

**The answer is (E) white present.** 



"
"Let's break down the ball swaps:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her purple ball, and Eve gets Alice's purple ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his pink ball, and Fred gets Dave's pink ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gives Gertrude her purple ball, and Gertrude gets Alice's purple ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire her white ball, and Claire gets Fred's white ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Bob's brown ball.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude gives Bob his black ball, and Bob gets Gertrude's black ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gives Claire her black ball, and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.

Looking at the final swap, Claire ends up with the black ball. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's break down the swaps and see what happens to the colors:

* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap, but we don't know if it changes the color.
* **Claire and Dave:**  They swap, but we don't know if it changes the color.
* **Fred and Gertrude:**  They swap, but we don't know if it changes the color.
* **Eve and Claire:**  They swap, but we don't know if it changes the color.
* **Eve and Fred:**  They swap, but we don't know if it changes the color.
* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap, but we don't know if it changes the color.
* **Eve and Claire:**  They swap, but we don't know if it changes the color.

**Answer:**  None of the above. 



"
"Let's analyze the swaps to figure out who has which ball at the end.

* **Eve and Claire:** Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Claire now has the purple ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob starts with a black ball, and Eve now has a purple ball. They swap, so Bob now has the purple ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** Claire now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Alice now has the purple ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Bob now has the pink ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave now has the purple ball, and Eve has the purple ball. They swap, so Dave now has the purple ball.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred now has the purple ball, and Gertrude has the brown ball. They swap, so Fred now has the brown ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude now has the brown ball, and Claire has the pink ball. They swap, so Gertrude now has the pink ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the pink ball at the end of the game.** 

**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we can see:

* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred moves to the left midfielder spot, Eve moves to the right winger spot.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve moves to the center midfielder spot, Claire moves to the right winger spot.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** Gertrude moves to the left winger spot, Alice moves to the center midfielder spot.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave moves to the right winger spot, Bob moves to the center midfielder spot.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire moves to the left winger spot, Alice moves to the striker spot.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob moves to the striker spot, Alice moves to the left winger spot.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** Gertrude moves to the right midfielder spot, Eve moves to the left winger spot.

**So, the final position for Dave is right winger.**

"
"Let's think about this!  

The key is to figure out what happens to the colors of the gifts.  Since the gifts are swapped around, the colors don't change.  

So, the answer is **(G) pink ball**. 



"
"Let's figure out what Eve has!

Here's how the gifts are swapped:

1. **Claire and Alice:**  Claire's present is now red, Alice's is pink.
2. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's present is now green, Gertrude's is brown.
3. **Alice and Dave:** Alice's present is now purple, Dave's is red.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see which books get swapped.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Eve's.
2. **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Fred's.
3. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
4. **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice's book is now Fred's, and Fred's book is now Alice's.
5. **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's book is now Dave's, and Dave's book is now Claire's.
6. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
7. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve's book is now Bob's, and Bob's book is now Eve's.

**Analyzing the swaps:**

* **Alice:** Alice's book is always the one that is swapped with Fred. 
* **Fred:** Fred's book is always the one that is swapped with Alice. 
* **Claire:** Claire's book is always the one that is swapped with Dave and Fred. 
* **Bob:** Bob's book is always the one that is swapped with Gertrude. 
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude's book is always the one that is swapped with Bob. 
* **Eve:** Eve's book is always the one that is swapped with Bob. 
* **Dave:** Dave's book is always the one that is swapped with Claire. 


**Conclusion:**

The only way to get to the end of the semester with Alice having The Odyssey is if she and Fred swapped books. 



**Answer:** (A) The Odyssey 



Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 
"
"Let's break down the trades:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets the blue ball and Claire gets the brown ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets the blue ball and Bob gets the black ball.
3. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets the black ball and Bob gets the blue ball.

Since the game ends with Bob having the blue ball, Alice must have the black ball. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Start:** Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Rodrigo, and Claire is with Patrick.
* **Claire and Alice switch:**  This means Claire is now with Karl, and Alice is with Patrick.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is with Rodrigo.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Rodrigo. 

The answer is **(C) Rodrigo**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob gets Alice's blue present and Alice gets Bob's orange ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire gets Alice's blue present and Alice gets Claire's brown present.

Since Claire started with a brown present, and then swapped with Alice, she must end up with the blue present. 

So the answer is **(C).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Alice becomes the right winger.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.

Since Bob started as the right winger, and then became the goalkeeper, he must be playing goalkeeper at the end of the match. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Let's think about the dance moves step by step:

1. **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Alice, and Claire now dances with Bob.
2. **Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire now dances with Bob, and Alice now dances with Claire.
3. **Bob and Alice switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Claire, and Alice now dances with Bob.

Since Bob and Alice switched partners in the last step, Bob is now dancing with Claire. 



So the answer is **(A) Patrick**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Bob and Alice switch partners.

**The answer is (A) Izzi.** 



"
"Let's break it down:

* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Claire, and Alice now dances with Bob.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Alice, and Claire now dances with Bob.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Claire, and Alice now dances with Bob.

Since the dance ends with Claire dancing with Bob, the answer is **(B) Jamie**. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down:

1. **Bob and Alice switch:** This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is now with Patrick.
2. **Claire and Bob switch:** This means Claire is now with Izzi, and Bob is now with Ophelia.
3. **Claire and Alice switch:** This means Claire is now with Patrick, and Alice is now with Izzi.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with **Patrick**. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is with Jamie, Bob is with Sam, and Claire is with Izzi.
* **Bob and Claire switch:**  This means Bob is now with Alice, and Claire is with Sam.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** This means Claire is now with Bob, and Alice is with Sam.

Since Claire and Bob switched partners, and then Claire and Alice switched partners, the final dance is with Alice and Sam. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Let's break down the swapping process:

* **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with a red ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Bob gets the red ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice now has the orange ball, and Claire has the black ball. They swap, so Alice gets the black ball and Claire gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire now has the orange ball, and Bob has the black ball. They swap, so Claire gets the black ball and Bob gets the orange ball.

Since they swap balls in a round-robin fashion, the final ball in the hands of Alice is the orange ball. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Claire gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the blue ball.

So, the final gift is Bob's purple present. 

**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Let's break down the trades:

2. **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice starts with the brown ball, and Claire starts with the yellow ball.
3. **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with the yellow ball, and Claire starts with the brown ball.

Since Bob starts with the yellow ball, and Claire starts with the brown ball, Bob ends up with the brown ball.

"Let's break down the swapping process:

* **Start:** Alice has green, Bob has purple, and Claire has blue.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob gets Alice's green ball and Alice gets Bob's purple ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire gets Bob's purple ball and Bob gets Claire's blue ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob gets Alice's green ball and Alice gets Bob's purple ball.

2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the blue ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Bob gets the blue ball.
3. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire now has the orange ball, and Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Claire gets the blue ball and Bob gets the orange ball.

* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob gets Alice's book (Frankenstein) and Alice gets Bob's book (Catch-22).
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Alice's book (Catch-22) and Alice gets Claire's book (Ulysses).

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a blue ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball.

"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire takes Alice's spot.

1. **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Alice is now with Claire, and Bob is with Melissa.
2. **Claire and Bob switch:** This means Claire is now with Rodrigo, and Bob is with Alice.

Since they switch partners twice, Bob is now dancing with Rodrigo.

**Therefore, Alice has The Fellowship of the Ring.**

"Okay, so let's think about it:

* **Start:** Alice is in the center, Bob is on the right, and Claire is on the right wing.
* **Claire and Alice switch:**  Claire moves to the right midfielder spot, and Alice moves to the right wing.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice moves to the right wing, and Bob moves to the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire moves to the center midfielder, and Bob moves to the right wing.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing right wing. 


**Answer: (B)**

"Let's break down the trades:

* **Alice starts with The Odyssey.**
* **Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring.**
* **Claire gets The Pearl.**
* **Bob and Claire swap books.** This means Bob gets The Pearl and Claire gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Claire and Alice swap books.** This means Claire gets The Fellowship of the Ring and Alice gets The Pearl.

Since Bob and Claire swapped books, and then Claire and Alice swapped books, Bob ends up with the book he started with. 


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with the white present:

* **Start:** Alice has pink, Bob has orange, and Claire has white.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they switch gifts.  We don't know who gets which gift, but we know the order is important.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they switch gifts. Again, we don't know who gets which gift, but we know the order is important.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they switch gifts again.

The key is that the order of the swaps matters.  

**So, who ends up with the white present?**

* **(A) pink ball**
* **(B) white present**
* **(C) orange ball**


 
Let me know if you'd like to try another one!

"Let's break down the book swapping:

* **Start:** Alice has *The Odyssey*, Bob has *Moby Dick*, and Claire has *Catch-22*.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They trade, so Claire gets Bob's book (Moby Dick) and Bob gets Claire's book (Catch-22).

* **Bob and Alice swap:** They trade again, so Alice gets Bob's book (Catch-22) and Bob gets Alice's book (The Odyssey).

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Finally, they trade, so Claire gets Alice's book (Moby Dick) and Alice gets Claire's book (The Odyssey).

**So, at the end of the semester, Claire has The Odyssey.** 


**Answer: (C)**

"Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Bob and Claire switch:** This means Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Bob is now dancing with Claire.
2. **Claire and Alice switch:** This means Alice is now dancing with Claire, and Claire is now dancing with Bob.
3. **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Bob is now dancing with Alice, and Alice is now dancing with Claire.

Since Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Bob is now dancing with Alice, then Claire must be dancing with **Helga**.

"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets Claire's red present and Claire gets Bob's pink ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's red present and Claire gets Alice's green present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's pink ball and Bob gets Alice's green present.

So, the final gift Alice has is the green present. 

The answer is **(C).**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* Alice starts with Patrick.
* Bob starts with Karl.
* Claire starts with Ophelia.

We know they switch partners a few times.  Let's see what happens:

1. **Bob and Alice switch:**  This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is with Patrick.
2. **Alice and Claire switch:** This means Alice is now with Bob, and Claire is with Patrick.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with **Patrick**. 


**Answer: (C) Patrick**

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets Alice's pink ball, and Alice gets Bob's white present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets Bob's white present, and Bob gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets Claire's orange ball, and Claire gets Alice's pink ball.

So, at the end, Bob has the orange ball. 

The answer is **(C).** 



"
"Let's break down the trades:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Claire gets Bob's green ball and Bob gets Claire's pink ball.
2. **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's pink ball and Claire gets Alice's orange ball.
3. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's green ball and Bob gets Alice's orange ball.

Since the final swap is between Bob and Alice, the ball that ends up with Claire is the orange ball.

"Let's think about the trades step-by-step:

1. **Start:** Alice has *The Odyssey*, Bob has *Lolita*, and Claire has *The Great Gatsby*.

2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  They trade, so Bob gets *The Odyssey* and Alice gets *Lolita*.

3. **Alice and Claire swap:** They trade, so Alice gets *The Great Gatsby* and Claire gets *Lolita*.

4. **Bob and Alice swap again:** They trade, so Bob gets *The Great Gatsby* and Alice gets *Lolita*.

"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Alice is the goalie, Bob is the midfielder, and Claire is the benchwarmer.
* **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire becomes the midfielder, and Bob becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice becomes the midfielder, and Bob becomes the goalie.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob becomes the benchwarmer, and Claire becomes the goalie.

"Let's break down the book swapping!

* **Start:** Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *The Odyssey*, and Claire has *Catch-22*.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They trade, so Claire gets Bob's book (The Odyssey) and Alice gets Claire's book (Catch-22).  Now Alice has *Catch-22* and Claire has *The Odyssey*.

* **Bob and Claire swap:** They trade again, so Bob gets Claire's book (The Odyssey) and Claire gets Bob's book (Hound of the Baskervilles). Now Bob has *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Claire has *The Odyssey*.

**So, Bob ends up with *Catch-22*.**

"Okay, let's think about this!

* **First swap:** Bob and Claire swap gifts.  This means Claire's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Claire.
* **Second swap:** Bob and Alice swap gifts. This means Alice's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Alice.

Since we don't know what color Bob starts with, we can't be sure what color he ends up with. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Alice is right midfielder, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left winger.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes right winger, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob becomes left winger, Alice becomes goalkeeper.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes goalkeeper, Bob becomes left winger.

So, at the end of the match, Bob is playing left winger. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Here's how to figure out the answer:

1. **Alice starts with Frankenstein:** She gets it at the beginning.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means they both trade books, so Alice gets The Great Gatsby and Bob gets Frankenstein.
3. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets The Great Gatsby and Bob gets Ulysses.
4. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob gets Ulysses and Alice gets The Great Gatsby.

**So, Bob ends up with Ulysses.**

**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Claire's. 
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Alice's.

So, after all the swapping, who has the original present? 

**The answer is (A) black ball.** 



"
"Let's think about the trades:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets Claire's purple ball and Claire gets Bob's red ball.
2. **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's purple ball and Claire gets Alice's brown ball.
3. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Alice's brown ball.

So, at the end of the game, Bob has the brown ball. 

**The answer is (C).**

"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out what Bob has:

* **Start:** Alice has white, Bob has orange, and Claire has brown.
* **Bob and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they got, but we know the order matters.
* **Claire and Bob Swap:**  We don't know what they got, but we know the order matters.
* **Claire and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they got, but we know the order matters.

**The key is that the order of the swaps matters.**  

**So, we can't know for sure what Bob has at the end.** 


**The answer is (None of the above)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Alice starts as left midfielder.**
* **Bob is fullback.**
* **Claire is right midfielder.**

Then, Alice and Claire switch positions.  So Claire is now the left midfielder, and Alice is the right midfielder.

Next, Bob and Alice switch positions.  This means Bob is now the left midfielder, and Alice is the fullback.

Finally, Alice and Claire switch positions again.  This means Alice is now the right midfielder, and Claire is the fullback.

So, Claire is playing fullback at the end of the match. 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is right midfielder, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left winger.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire becomes goalkeeper, Bob becomes left winger.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob becomes right midfielder, Alice becomes goalkeeper.
* **Claire and Bob swap again:** Claire becomes left winger, Bob becomes goalkeeper.

So, at the end of the match, Claire is playing left winger.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is with Melissa, Alice is with Rodrigo, and Claire is with Jamie.

* **Bob and Claire switch:**  They switch partners.
* **Alice and Bob switch:**  They switch partners.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** They switch partners again.

This means the final dance is with the last partner they had. 

**So, the answer is (C) Melissa.** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Alice starts with blue.**
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Bob's pink ball and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's purple present and Claire gets Alice's blue present.

So, Alice ends up with the pink ball. 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Let's break down the swapping process:

1. **Claire and Alice:**  Claire starts with a white ball, and Alice starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Claire gets the yellow ball.
2. **Bob and Alice:** Alice now has the white ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the white ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob now has the white ball, and Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the white ball and Bob gets the orange ball.

Since Bob ends up with the orange ball, Alice must have the **orange** ball.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Claire goes from cheerleader to fullback, and Bob goes to cheerleader.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice goes from fullback to cheerleader, and Claire goes to fullback.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice goes from cheerleader to fullback, and Bob goes to cheerleader.

So, at the end of the match, Claire is playing fullback.

"
"Okay, let's think this through:

* **Claire starts with a pink ball.**
* **Alice starts with a yellow present.**
* **Bob starts with a red present.**

Here's how the swapping works:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Bob's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Claire's present, and Bob gets Alice's present.

Since Claire started with a pink ball, and Alice started with a yellow present, the only possible outcome is that Claire ends up with the yellow present. 

**So the answer is (C) yellow present.** 



"
"Let's break down the trading!

* **Start:** Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They switch books, so Bob gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Claire gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice now has *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Bob has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

* **Final Result:**  Alice ends up with *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Claire has *Lolita*. 


**So the answer is (C) Hound of the Baskervilles.** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down:

1. **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Alice is now with Patrick, and Bob is with Lola.
2. **Claire and Bob switch:** This means Claire is now with Alice, and Bob is with Patrick.
3. **Bob and Alice switch:** This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is with Rodrigo.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with **Claire**. 


**Answer: (A) Patrick** 
"
"Okay, let's break down the gift exchange!

Here's what we know:

* Alice starts with a yellow present.
* Bob starts with a blue present.
* Claire starts with a green present.

The key is that the order of the swaps matters.  Let's look at the possibilities:

* **Alice and Bob swap first:**  This means Alice gets Bob's present (blue) and Bob gets Alice's present (yellow).
* **Claire and Alice swap first:** This means Claire gets Alice's present (yellow) and Alice gets Claire's present (green).
* **Alice and Bob swap second:** This means Alice gets Bob's present (blue) and Bob gets Alice's present (yellow).

The only way Alice ends up with the green present is if Claire and Alice swap first. 


**Therefore, the answer is (A) green present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is in the center, Bob is the goalie, and Claire is on the left.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire becomes the goalie, and Alice moves to the left.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice becomes the goalie, and Bob moves to the center.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire becomes the left winger, and Bob moves to the center.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing **center midfielder**. 


 
"
"Okay, here's how to figure out the answer:

* **Start:** Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *Catch-22*, and Claire has *Ulysses*.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they both get each other's books.
    * Bob gets *Ulysses*
    * Claire gets *Catch-22*

* **Claire and Alice swap:** 
    * Claire gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*
    * Alice gets *Catch-22*

* **End:** Claire has *Hound of the Baskervilles*. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think this through!

* **Alice starts with a red present.**
* **Bob has a black ball.**
* **Claire has a pink ball.**

They swap gifts in a round-robin fashion.  

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they exchange their gifts. Since Alice starts with a red present, and Claire starts with a pink ball, they swap.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Claire's pink ball, and Bob has Alice's red present, they swap.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Bob's red present, and Claire has Bob's black ball, they swap.

**So, Claire ends up with the black ball.** 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is with Sam, Alice is with Melissa, and Claire is with Karl.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  They swap partners.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** They swap partners again.
* **Bob and Alice switch:** They switch partners one more time.

The final dance partner for Bob is Melissa. 


**So the answer is (A).** 



"
"Let's break down the trades:

* **Alice starts with Frankenstein.**
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice gets Lolita and Claire gets Frankenstein.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob gets Frankenstein and Alice gets The Odyssey.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets The Odyssey and Bob gets Lolita.

So, at the end of the semester, Alice has The Odyssey. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Alice's, and Alice's present becomes Claire's. 
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Alice's.

Since the gifts are swapped, we need to figure out who ends up with what.  

**Bob starts with the purple present.**
**Alice starts with the orange ball.**
**Claire starts with the blue present.**

After the swaps, Bob will have the blue present. 

**So the answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means Alice takes Bob's spot.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they swap places again.

Since they switched partners twice, and Claire started with Rodrigo, the final dance will be Claire with Rodrigo. 

**Answer:** (C) Rodrigo. 
"
"Let's break it down:

1. **Claire and Alice switch:** This means Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Alice is now dancing with Lola.
2. **Bob and Claire switch:** This means Bob is now dancing with Alice, and Claire is now dancing with Izzi.
3. **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Alice is now dancing with Claire, and Bob is now dancing with Lola.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with Izzi. 


**Answer: (C) Izzi** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob gets the purple ball and Claire gets the white ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets the purple ball and Bob gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Bob gets the orange ball and Claire gets the white ball.

Since Bob gets the orange ball in the last swap, he must have it at the end. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Claire and Bob switch:** This means Claire now dances with Karl, and Bob now dances with Ophelia.
2. **Alice and Claire switch:** This means Alice now dances with Bob, and Claire now dances with Karl.
3. **Bob and Alice switch:** This means Bob now dances with Claire, and Alice now dances with Ophelia.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Ophelia. 

**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this:

* Alice starts with a white present.
* Bob has an orange ball.
* Claire has a brown present.

They swap gifts, and we need to figure out who ends up with what. 

**Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets orange, Bob gets white.
**Claire and Bob swap:** Bob gets brown, Claire gets orange.
**Claire and Alice swap:** Alice gets brown, Claire gets white.

So, at the end, Alice has the brown present. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Start:** Alice has orange, Bob has purple, and Claire has red.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets Bob's purple, and Bob gets Claire's red.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's purple, and Bob gets Alice's orange.

So, Bob ends up with the orange ball! 


**Answer: (C) orange ball** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is on the right wing, Bob is the right midfielder, and Claire is the fullback.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  Bob moves to fullback, and Alice moves to the right wing.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice moves to the right midfielder, and Claire moves to fullback.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob moves to the right midfielder, and Claire moves to the right wing.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing the **right midfielder**. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire goes to goalie, and Alice goes to striker.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice becomes the goalie, and Bob becomes the striker.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the goalie.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing striker. 

The answer is **(C).** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a red present, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Alice gets the pink ball and Claire gets the red present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice now has the pink ball, and Bob has the red present. They swap, so Bob gets the pink ball and Alice gets the red present.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice now has the red present, and Claire has the pink ball. They swap, so Claire gets the red present and Alice gets the pink ball.

Since Bob started with the red present, and Alice and Claire swapped gifts, Bob ends up with the pink ball. 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:** Alice is fullback, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left midfielder.

"
"Let's break down the swapping process:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice starts with an orange ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Alice gets the pink ball and Claire gets the orange ball.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice now has the pink ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the pink ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has the orange ball, and Claire has the pink ball. They swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Alice gets the pink ball.

Since Alice and Claire swapped balls three times, Alice ends up with the pink ball.

"
"Okay, so here's how we figure this out:

* **Start:** Alice has blue, Bob has red, and Claire has black.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gives Bob her black ball, and Bob gives Claire her red present.  So now Claire has the red present and Bob has the black ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gives Alice her black ball, and Alice gives Bob her blue present.  So now Alice has the blue present and Bob has the black ball.
* **Final:** Claire has the blue present. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Let's think about this step-by-step:

1. **Start:** Alice has pink, Bob has white, and Claire has blue.
2. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they switch gifts.  Since they start with different colors, Claire gets Bob's white present and Bob gets Claire's blue present.
3. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Now, Alice has the blue present, and Claire has the white present.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:**  Finally, they switch gifts again. Since they started with different colors, Claire gets Bob's white present and Bob gets Claire's blue present.

**Therefore, Claire ends up with the blue present.** 


The answer is **(C)**.

* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob starts with a brown ball, and Claire now has the pink ball. They swap, so Bob gets the pink ball and Claire gets the brown ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire now has the pink ball, and Alice has the white ball. They swap, so Claire gets the white ball and Alice gets the pink ball.

Since Claire ends up with the white ball, Bob must have the pink ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the swaps:

* **Start:** Alice has green, Bob has red, Claire has brown.
* **First swap:** Claire and Alice switch, so Claire gets Bob's red ball and Alice gets Claire's brown ball.
* **Second swap:** Bob and Claire switch, so Bob gets Claire's brown ball and Claire gets Bob's red ball.
* **Final swap:** Claire and Alice switch, so Claire gets Alice's green ball and Alice gets Claire's brown ball.

Since Claire and Alice swap balls in the final step, Claire ends up with the brown ball. 


**Answer: (C) brown ball** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Trade 1:** Bob and Alice switch places.  Bob becomes the goalie, and Alice becomes the cheerleader.
* **Trade 2:** Claire and Bob switch places.  Claire becomes the goalie, and Bob becomes the right midfielder.
* **Trade 3:**  Claire and Alice switch places. Claire becomes the right midfielder, and Alice becomes the goalie.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing right midfielder. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this step-by-step:

* **Alice starts with a red ball.**
* **Bob starts with an orange ball.**
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets Bob's orange ball and Bob gets Alice's red ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob now has the red ball, and Claire has the orange ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice now has the orange ball, and Bob has the red ball.

So, Alice ends up with the red ball. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's break it down:

* **Start:** Claire is the left winger, Alice is the center midfielder, and Bob is the goalkeeper.
* **Trade 1:** Claire and Alice switch positions, so Claire is now the center midfielder and Alice is the left winger.
* **Trade 2:** Alice and Bob switch positions, so Alice is the goalkeeper and Bob is the center midfielder.
* **Trade 3:** Claire and Bob switch positions, so Claire is now the left winger and Bob is the center midfielder.

So, Claire is the left winger at the end of the match. 


The answer is **(B).** 
"
"Let's think about the trades step-by-step:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a pink ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball. They swap, so now Alice has the blue ball and Claire has the pink ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the blue ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so now Bob has the blue ball and Alice has the orange ball.
3. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire now has the pink ball, and Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so now Bob has the pink ball and Claire has the blue ball.

So, Bob ends up with the pink ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is with Karl, Alice is with Patrick, and Claire is with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  They swap partners.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** They swap partners again.

This means the final dance is Bob with Ophelia. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is striker, Bob is midfielder, and Claire is left midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes striker, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire becomes midfielder, Alice becomes striker.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob becomes left midfielder, Claire becomes striker.

So, at the end of the game, Claire is playing striker. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, here's how to figure this out:

* **Start:** Alice has blue, Bob has brown, and Claire has white.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Bob's brown, Alice gets Claire's white.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Claire's white, Claire gets Bob's brown.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's brown, Bob gets Alice's blue.

So, Bob ends up with the blue present. 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Bob's orange ball and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's brown present and Claire gets Alice's blue present.

Since Alice started with a blue present, and then received a brown present from Claire, and then received an orange ball from Bob, Alice will end up with the **orange ball**. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's break it down:

1. **Alice and Claire switch:** This means Alice is now dancing with Bob, and Claire is now dancing with Sam.
2. **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Alice is now dancing with Claire, and Bob is now dancing with Sam.
3. **Bob and Claire switch:** This means Bob is now dancing with Claire, and Claire is now dancing with Rodrigo.

So, Claire is dancing with Rodrigo at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Alice is the left midfielder, Bob is the right midfielder, and Claire is the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Alice becomes the right midfielder.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes the right midfielder.
* **Bob and Alice switch again:** Bob becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the right midfielder.

So, at the end of the match, Alice is playing the right midfielder. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is with Rodrigo, Bob is with Melissa, and Claire is with Jamie.
* **Bob and Claire switch:**  This means they swap partners.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** This means they swap partners.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** This means they swap partners again.

The only way Claire can end up with Jamie is if they switch partners again. 


**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Let's think about the dance moves:

* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners again:** This means they swap places again.

Since Bob and Alice switch partners twice, and they start with Bob and Alice, the final dance partner for Alice is **Melissa**.

"Let's break down the swapping process:

* **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a red ball. They swap, so Alice gets the red ball and Bob gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with a black ball, and Bob now has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Bob gets the black ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice now has the red ball, and Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Claire gets the red ball.

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Let's break down the swapping process:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a pink ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Claire gets the pink ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the blue ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
3. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire now has the orange ball, and Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Claire gets the blue ball.

Since Claire and Bob swapped balls, Claire ends up with the blue ball. 


**The answer is (C).**

"Okay, let's break down the swapping process:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a green ball. They swap, so Alice gets the green ball and Claire gets the blue ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the green ball, and Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the green ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire now has the blue ball, and Alice has the green ball. They swap, so Alice gets the blue ball and Claire gets the green ball.

Since they swap balls multiple times, Alice ends up with the green ball. 


The answer is **(A).** 
"
"Let's break down the swapping process:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a green ball. They swap, so Claire now has the blue ball and Alice has the green ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the green ball, and Bob has the black ball.
3. **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire now has the blue ball, and Alice has the green ball.

Since Claire started with the green ball, and then swapped with Alice, she must end up with the blue ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

* **First trade:** Bob switches places with Alice, who is now the cheerleader.
* **Second trade:** Alice and Claire switch places, so Alice is now the goalkeeper.
* **Third trade:** Alice and Bob switch places again, and now Bob is the cheerleader.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing the cheerleader position. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* **Start:** Claire is with Bob, Alice is with Jamie, and Patrick is with Claire.
* **Switch 1:** Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **Switch 2:** Alice and Claire switch partners.

This means that after the first switch, Bob is now with Alice, and Claire is with Patrick. After the second switch, Alice is with Patrick, and Claire is with Bob. 

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is with **Patrick**.

* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice starts with the red ball, and Claire starts with the pink ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire starts with the pink ball, and Bob starts with the green ball.

Since Claire starts with the pink ball, she ends up with the pink ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Let's break down the trades:

* **Start:** Alice has Frankenstein, Bob has The Pearl, and Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they both get each other's books. So Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring and Claire gets The Pearl.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets The Pearl and Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Final swap:**  Alice gets The Pearl, Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring, and Claire gets Frankenstein.

So, Alice ends up with The Pearl.

"Let's break down the steps:

1. **Alice starts with a brown ball.**
2. **Alice and Bob swap balls.**  This means Bob gets the brown ball and Alice gets the red ball.
3. **Bob and Claire swap balls.**  Bob now has the red ball, and Claire has the brown ball.
4. **Alice and Bob swap balls.**  Alice now has the red ball, and Bob has the brown ball.

Since Claire started with the blue ball, she ends up with the blue ball. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Let's break down the trades:

* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap, so Claire starts with a pink ball and Bob starts with a blue ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Claire starts with a blue ball and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap, so Bob starts with a blue ball and Claire starts with a pink ball.

Since Bob starts with a blue ball, the answer is (A). 


"
"Okay, so let's break it down:

* **Alice starts with a white present.**
* **Bob starts with a blue present.**
* **Claire starts with a yellow present.**

They swap gifts in a round-robin fashion.  

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice gets Bob's blue present, and Bob gets Alice's white present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's blue present, and Claire gets Alice's white present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's blue present, and Bob gets Alice's white present.

Since they swap gifts in a round-robin fashion, Alice ends up with the blue present.

"Okay, so let's think about this:

* **Start:** Alice has a black ball, Bob has an orange ball, and Claire has a white ball.
* **First Swap:** Claire and Bob swap.  Claire gives Bob her white ball, and Bob gives Claire her orange ball. Now Bob has the white ball and Claire has the orange ball.
* **Second Swap:** Bob and Alice swap. Bob gives Alice her black ball, and Alice gives Bob her orange ball. Now Alice has the black ball and Bob has the orange ball.
* **Third Swap:** Bob and Claire swap. Bob gives Claire her white ball, and Claire gives Bob her orange ball. Now Bob has the white ball and Claire has the orange ball.

**So, Bob ends up with the black ball.** 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with what:

* **Start:** Alice has red, Bob has black, and Claire has white.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they switch gifts.  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts again.  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  They switch gifts for the final time.

The key is that the order of the swaps matters.  

Let's think about the possibilities:

* **Scenario 1:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, then Claire would end up with the red present. 
* **Scenario 2:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, then Claire would end up with the black ball. 
* **Scenario 3:** If Bob and Claire swap, and then Alice and Bob swap, and then Claire and Alice swap, then Claire would end up with the white present. 

**Therefore, the answer is (C) black ball.** 



"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Alice starts with a yellow ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice now has the blue ball, and Bob now has the yellow ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has the pink ball, and Claire now has the blue ball.

So, Bob ends up with the pink ball. 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's purple ball and Bob gets Alice's white ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Bob's purple ball and Bob gets Claire's pink ball.

Since Bob ends up with the pink ball, and Alice ends up with the white ball, the answer is **(A) white ball**. 


"
"Okay, let's break down the dance moves:

* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means they swap partners.
* **Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** This means they swap partners again.

Let's think about the final dance:

* **Alice starts with Lola.**
* **Bob starts with Rodrigo.**
* **Claire starts with Patrick.**

**The final dance:**

* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** Alice is now dancing with Rodrigo.
* **Claire and Bob switch partners:** Claire is now dancing with Alice.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** Bob is now dancing with Claire.
