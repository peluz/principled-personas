"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things for sure:

* **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
* **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's see what we can figure out!

**Here's what we know:**

* The mystery book reader is in the second house.
* The bird keeper is not in the third house.
* The percussionist is to the left of the computer owner.
* The gameboy owner is to the left of the rose bouquet owner.
* The cellist is not in the third house.

**Now, let's use this information to figure out the rest:**

* **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

**The answer is (C) 2.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm Larissa, and I'm a whiz at logic puzzles.  

Here's how we'll tackle this:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:**  The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
* **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
* **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
* **Clue 6:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 8:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
* **Clue 9:** The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 10:** There is one house between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
* **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
* **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the cat lover lives.
* **Clue 14:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.

**2.  Analyze the information:**

* **Focus on the most direct clues:**  These clues give us specific relationships between people and their characteristics. 
* **Use the clues to eliminate possibilities:**  As you work through the clues, you can eliminate houses and possibilities.

**3.  Deduction and Logic:**

* **Work systematically:**  Use the clues to build a logical chain of reasoning. 
* **Cross-reference:**  Compare and contrast clues to see if they provide additional information.

**4.  Finding the answer:**

* **The key is to use the clues to eliminate possibilities and find the most likely answer.**

"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the person who drives a truck isn't in the third house, and the person who owns an SUV isn't in the third house.  This means the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV cannot be in the same house. 

We also know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, the person who owns an SUV must live in house number 2. 


**Answer:**  2 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.  That's our first clue.  

We also know the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.  

We know the swimmer lives in the first house.  

Finally, we know the cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

Let's put it all together:

* **1. Swimmer**
* **2. Spaghetti**
* **3. Fried Rice**

The person who ate spaghetti lives in house **2**.

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  

Here's how we can figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.  

**First, let's look at some key clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The cellist lives in the first house.
* **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 3:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.

**Now, let's use these clues to eliminate possibilities:**

* **Clue 1 & 4:** The cellist is in the first house, and the golfer is not in the fourth house. This means the golfer must be in houses 2, 3, or 4.
* **Clue 2 & 4:** The violinist is not in the fourth house, and the golfer is not in the fourth house. This means the violinist must be in houses 1, 2, or 3.

**Next, let's use other clues to narrow down the possibilities:**

* **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives to the left of the person who likes red.
* **Clue 6:** The flutist lives to the right of the person wearing boots.
* **Clue 7:** The flutist lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes.
* **Clue 9:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
* **Clue 10:** The flutist lives to the right of the cricketer.
* **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives to the right of the root beer lover.
* **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives to the left of the coffee drinker.

**Let's use these clues to figure out the location of the person who only drinks water!**

The answer is **(B) 1**. 
"
"Let's break this down! 

We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.  We also know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person eating kiwis.  This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1.  The person who likes blue lives in house 2.

We also know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green.  We also know the person who likes apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.

Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We have a few clues, and we need to figure out where the pizza person lives. 

* **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

Let's start with the most direct clues:

* **Clue 1** and **Clue 2** tell us that the person with the radio is next to the person who drives a truck.
* **Clue 2** also tells us that the person with the radio is to the left of the pizza person.

This means the truck driver and the pizza person are on opposite sides of the houses. 

Now, let's use Clue 3 and 4 to help us out:

* **Clue 3** tells us the root beer lover does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 4** tells us the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

This means the person who has a computer is not in the first house. 

**Therefore, the pizza person must live in house number 2.**

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm Larissa, and I'm ready to solve this! 

Here's what we know:

* **We have a house with a dog owner, a person who loves horses, a cat lover, and a fish enthusiast.**
* **Each person has a different kind of shoe, drink, favorite color, and car.**

Let's start by looking for clues that can help us figure out the order of the houses. 

**Here's what I've got so far:**

* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

**Now, let's see if we can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses.** 

I'll keep you posted! 


**What's the number of the house where the person who likes red lives?**

(A) 3
(B) 4
(C) 2
(D) 1

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm Larissa, and I'm a puzzle solver extraordinaire.  Here's how we'll tackle this:

**Step 1:  The Foundation**

We need to start with the most direct clues.  These are the ones that give us the most concrete information.  Let's focus on those first.

**Step 2:  Building the Framework**

It's helpful to create a grid to keep track of all the information.  This will help us see the relationships between the houses and the people.

**Step 3:  The Logic**

We'll use logic and deduction to figure out the answers.  We'll look for patterns and relationships between the clues.

**Step 4:  The Solution**

We'll work systematically, eliminating possibilities as we go.  

**Let's get started!** 


**Question 1:**  The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who is eating grapes.  What is the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives?

**(A) 1**
**(B) 3**
**(C) 4**
**(D) 2**
**(E) 5**


 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know the soccer player lives in the third house.  That's a good starting point.  We also know the person with lilies lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.  

Let's think about the other clues:

* **Clue 1:** The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
* **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

This tells us a lot about the order of the houses.  

The person who ate grilled cheese must be in a house to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.  

Now, we know the soccer player is in the third house.  We also know the person with lilies lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.  

Let's look at the possibilities.

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  

Here's what we know:

* **We have a house for each person, and each person has a unique lunch, favorite color, and instrument.**  
* **We need to figure out where each person lives.**

Let's start with the most direct clues:

* **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 3:** The pianist lives in the third house.
* **Clue 9:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

**Now, let's make a grid to help us visualize the information:**

```
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
-------|---|---|---|---|
  P |  |  |  |  
  S |  |  |  |  
  F |  |  |  |  
  P |  |  |  |  
  Y |  |  |  |  
```

We can start filling in the grid with the clues we have. 

**Let me know if you'd like to work through the rest of the clues together!**

**3.  Deduce the location of the computer:**

* **Clue 2** and **Clue 4** tell us that the person with the gameboy is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 8** tells us that the soccer player and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
* **Clue 4** tells us that the person wearing boots is to the left of the person with the computer.

**4.  Analyze the clues and deduce the location of the computer:**

Based on the above deductions, the person with the computer must be in house **C**. 



**Answer:**  **C** 


Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 
"
"The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.  Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1. 

The answer is **(B) 1**. 
"
"The pianist lives in house 1, and the root beer lover lives to the right of the person who owns horses.  This means the root beer lover can't be in house 2.  Since the person who likes white doesn't live in house 2, the dog owner must live in house 2. 

Therefore, the dog owner lives in **(B) 2**. 
"
"Okay, let's crack this code!  

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

Let's start by filling in the grid:

```
House | Book | Instrument | Lunch
-------|-------|----------|-------
1     |  |  |  
2     |  |  |  
3     |  |  |  
4     |  |  |  
```

We can use these clues to start filling in the grid.  

**What's the most important clue?**

* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives in the second house. 
* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know two things for sure:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
* **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's think about this:

* **Houses 1 and 2** are the only options. 
* We know the person wearing sandals is to the left of the person with horses. 
* We also know the person who ate spaghetti is to the right of the person who likes history books.

So, the only possible arrangement is:

```
1  (Sandals)  
2  (Horses)
```

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in house number **2**. 



 
"
"The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house **2**. 

**Answer: B** 
"
"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 3:** The carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 6:** The rose bouquet lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** There is one house between the daffodils and the rose bouquet.

This gives us a good starting point!  Let's see what else we can figure out. 

**Here's a little grid to help us visualize:**

```
1 | 2 | 3 | 4
-------|----|----|----
C  |  |  |  
R  |  |  |  
G  |  |  |  
T  |  |  |  
```

We need to use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the grid.  

Let me know if you'd like to work through the rest of the clues together!

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  

Here's what we know:

* **We have a few key clues:**  We know the coffee drinker lives in the third house, and the root beer lover doesn't live in the first. 
* **The phone and tulips are close:**  Clue 16 tells us they're next to each other.
* **The computer and phone are together:** Clue 11 tells us they're together.
* **The saxophonist isn't in the second house:** Clue 6 tells us this.
* **The person with the vase of tulips is somewhere in the middle:** Clue 2 tells us there's a house between the person with the rose bouquet and the person with the lilies.

**Let's start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
* **Clue 11:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
* **Clue 16:** The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 17:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.

**Now, let's see if we can figure out the rest!**

**Which house is the vase of tulips in?**

**(A) 5**
**(B) 3**
**(C) 1**
**(D) 4**
**(E) 2**


 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know the golfer lives in the first house, and the person with the rose bouquet doesn't live in the second house.  This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house. 

We also know the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.  

Let's see...  

* **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
* **Clue 4:** The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
* **Clue 5:** The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 6:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm Larissa, and I'm a whiz at logic puzzles.  

Here's how we'll approach this:

**1.  The Basics:**

* We need to figure out the location of the percussionist. 
* We'll use the clues to build a picture of the houses and their occupants.

**2.  Let's Start with the Strong Clues:**

* **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The flutist lives in the second house.
* **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.

**3.  Building the Grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the houses and their occupants.  I'll use a simple grid to keep track of the information.

**4.  Deduction Time!**

We'll use the clues to eliminate possibilities and find the answer.  

**5.  The Answer:**

I'm confident I can solve this!  Let me know if you want to see the steps!

"Okay, let's crack this code!  

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 7:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses.  Let's start by looking at the clues that tell us about the people's food and colors.

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm Larissa, and I'm a whiz at logic puzzles.  

Here's how we'll approach this:

**1.  The Basics:**

* We need to figure out where the pianist lives.
* We have a bunch of clues, and we'll use them to build a picture of the houses and their occupants.

**2.  Let's Start with the Clues:**

* **Clue 1:**  There are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person eating apples.
* **Clue 2:** The baseball player doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
* **Clue 5:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the tennis player.
* **Clue 6:** There is one house between the percussionist and the person who likes green.
* **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
* **Clue 8:** There is one house between the person who likes blue and the person eating oranges.
* **Clue 9:** There is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker.
* **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
* **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

**3.  Building the Grid:**

I'll create a grid to help us visualize the information.  We'll use numbers to represent the houses.

**4.  The Solution:**

We'll use the clues to fill in the grid and deduce the location of the pianist.  

**Answer:**

(A) 4 


Let me know if you want to work through the grid together! 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things for sure:

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
* **Clue 5:** The person wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 6:** The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
* **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives. 


**Answer:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. 


 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things for sure:

* **Clue 5:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.

This tells us the rose bouquet person is in house 2.  And since the science fiction book fanatic lives next to them, they must be in house 3.

Now let's look at the other clues:

* **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations.
* **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with the vase of tulips.

We can use these clues to figure out the rest of the houses. 


**Therefore, the person with the lilies lives in house 2.**

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm Larissa, and I'm a whiz at logic puzzles.  

Here's how we'll approach this:

**1.  The Big Picture:**

We need to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.  We'll use the clues to build a picture of the houses and their occupants.

**2.  The Clues:**

Let's start with the most direct clues:

* **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
* **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 13:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 16:** The person who is eating grapes does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 17:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the cat lover.

**3.  Building the Grid:**

I'm going to create a grid to keep track of all the information.  It's like a puzzle map!

```
House | Flowers | Car | Fruit | Pet | Shoes
-------|---------|-------|------|------|-------
1     |  |  |  |  |  
2     |  |  |  |  |  
3     |  |  |  |  |  
4     |  |  |  |  |  
5     |  |  |  |  |  
```

**4.  The Deduction:**

Now, let's start filling in the grid.  We'll use the clues to figure out the relationships between the people and their characteristics. 

**5.  The Solution:**

I'm going to use my logic skills to figure out the location of the person who drives a truck.

"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the following:

* **Clue 3:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

This means the second house is a key location. 

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. 
* **Clue 2:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Let's use this information to figure out the order of the houses. 

The person who ate fried rice is in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house. 


**Answer:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in **(C) 3**. 
"
"The carnation person lives in house 1.  

**Answer: B** 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things about our neighbors:

* **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person wearing high heels.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person wearing high heels lives.

**Here's how we can figure it out:**

* **Clue 1** tells us the person who only drinks water is to the left of the person wearing high heels.
* **Clue 2** tells us the person wearing sandals is to the left of the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 3** tells us the person eating kiwis lives in the second house.

**Putting it all together:**

We know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.  Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, the person wearing sandals must live in house 2. 

**Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.**

"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
* **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

**Here's how it works:**

* Since the person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes live next to each other, and the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television, we can deduce the following:
    * The person with a television is to the right of the person wearing sandals.
    * The person wearing sandals is to the left of the person eating grapes.
    * The person eating grapes is to the left of the person who drinks tea.

* We also know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person who drinks tea.

**The only way to satisfy all the clues is if the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.** 



**Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house, and the violinist doesn't live in the third house.  That means the order is:

* **T** (Tea drinker)
* **V** (Violinist)
* **W** (Water drinker)

Clue 1 tells us the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the cellist.  Clue 2 tells us there's a house between the violinist and the guitarist.  

So, the guitarist must be in house 2. 


**Therefore, the answer is (A) 2.** 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know the person wearing sandals lives in the third house.  That's a good start!  We also know the person wearing running shoes isn't in the first house.  

Let's look at the clues that tell us about the order of the houses:

* **Clue 3:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
* **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.

This is helpful!  We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses. 

The person who likes milk lives in the third house.  

Let's see...  We know the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person who wears boots.  

The person who wears running shoes isn't in the first house. 

The person who wears loafers lives somewhere between the coffee drinker and the person who wears running shoes. 

The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who wears boots. 

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses. 

The answer is **(D) 3**.

"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things about these two houses and their residents:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
* **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

Let's use this information to figure out where the person who had stew lives. 

**Here's how we can figure it out:**

* **Clue 1** tells us the person wearing running shoes is to the right of the person eating oranges. 
* **Clue 2** tells us the mystery book reader is to the left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 3** tells us the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other.

**Putting it all together:**

We know the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other.  Since the mystery book reader is to the left of the cat lover, we can deduce that the person who had stew lives in house 1. 


**Answer:** The person who had stew lives in **house 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know the root beer lover lives in the first house (Clue 3).  We also know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house (Clue 2).  

Let's use this information to create a little grid to help us figure out the rest. 

* House 1:  R
* House 2:  M
* House 3:  T

We need to figure out the order of the houses based on the clues. 

**The person who has a television lives to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 5).** 

**The person who has a television does not live in the second house (Clue 4).**

**The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone (Clue 1).**

**Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house 2.** 


**Answer: (C) 2** 



"
"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  

Here's what we know:

* **House 1:**  We know the person wearing loafers lives here.
* **House 2:**  We need to figure out who lives here.
* **House 3:**  We need to figure out who lives here.

Let's start by looking at the clues and seeing if we can figure out the order of the houses. 

**Clue 2:** The person with a phone lives to the left of the person eating mangos. 
**Clue 3:** The person eating grapes lives to the left of the person drinking water.
**Clue 4:** The person wearing boots does not live in the third house.
**Clue 5:** The person eating kiwis lives to the left of the person who likes milk.

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  

Here's how we can figure out where the truck driver lives:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
* **Clue 3:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
* **Clue 4:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
* **Clue 5:** The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 6:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

**2.  Create a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the information.  Here's a simple grid to represent the houses and their occupants:

```
     1  2  3
A - - -
B - - -
C - - -
```

**3.  Use the clues to fill in the grid:**

* **Clue 1:**  We know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the spaghetti eater.
* **Clue 2:**  We know the stew eater is to the left of the lily person.
* **Clue 3:**  The rose person is to the left of the truck driver.
* **Clue 4:**  The minivan driver is to the left of the stew eater.
* **Clue 5:**  The red person is not in the first house.
* **Clue 6:**  The minivan driver is to the left of the daffodil person.

**4.  Deduce the order:**

By carefully analyzing the clues and their relationships, you can deduce the order of the houses and the occupants. 

**5.  Find the truck driver's house:**

The final step is to determine the house number of the person who drives a truck.

"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things for sure:

* **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other.

Let's think about the other clues and how they might help us figure out where the mango eater lives. 

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other.

We can start to build a grid to help us visualize the relationships. 

**Here's what we know:**

* **House 1:** Saxophonist
* **House 2:**  
 
Let's see if we can figure out the mango eater's house!

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm Larissa, and I'm a puzzle solver extraordinaire.  

Here's how we'll tackle this:

**1.  The Basics:**

We've got a bunch of clues about people, their houses, and their preferences.  Our goal is to figure out where the romance book lover lives.

**2.  Let's Get Organized:**

I'm going to use a grid to keep track of everything.  It's like a detective's notebook, but with fruit, music, shoes, and books!

**3.  The Clues:**

We'll start with the most direct clues and work our way through.  

**4.  The Process:**

I'll use logic and deduction to figure out the order of the houses and their occupants.  It's like a puzzle, but with people!

**5.  The Answer:**

I'll keep you updated as I solve the puzzle.  

**Ready to start?** 


Let me know if you want to see the grid or if you'd like me to explain my thought process!

"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the person wearing boots lives in the first house.  We also know the person with lilies lives somewhere else, and the person with high heels lives somewhere else.  The person with daffodils lives in the first house. 

So, the person with lilies lives in house 2.  The person with high heels lives in house 3.

* **Clue 5** tells us the person with lilies is to the right of the swimmer.
* **Clue 6** tells us the person who likes yellow is to the left of the daffodil person.
* **Clue 7** tells us the person who likes red is to the left of the person with lilies.
* **Clue 9** tells us the person with a vase of tulips and the baseball player are next to each other.
* **Clue 10** tells us the person who likes white is not in the second house.
* **Clue 11** tells us the person with a carnations arrangement is to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.

* **House 1** has the person wearing high heels.
* **House 3** has the person who owns a sedan.
* **House 1** has the person who owns a sedan.
* **House 1** has the person who is a cat lover.

Let's use this information to figure out the rest! 


**Question:** What is the number of the house where the person who is wearing running shoes lives?

**(A) 2**
**(B) 1**
**(C) 3** 


The answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's crack this puzzle! 

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

Let's start by combining these clues to see if we can figure out the order of the houses.

* **Clue 1 & 4:** We know the tea drinker is in the third house and the carnations arrangement is in the first.
* **Clue 5 & 7:** The vase of tulips is in the second house and the running shoes are in the first.

Now, let's use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps.

* **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.

"That's a tricky question!  It's not really a simple ""yes"" or ""no"" situation.  Both waltzes and slam dances have their own risks.  

Waltz is a graceful dance, but it still requires strength and flexibility.  If you're not careful, you could pull a muscle or twist an ankle.  

Slam dance is all about power and energy, and that can lead to injuries if you're not careful.  

So, it's not really about which is ""less"" injurious, it's more about how you approach each dance.  
 
**Which dance is more likely to cause injuries?**

(A) Waltz
(B) Slam dance

"Absolutely! Euphoria is definitely associated with drug addiction.  It's a big part of the initial draw for many people.  

Here's why:

* **Dopamine Rush:** Drugs like cocaine, heroin, and meth all flood your brain with dopamine, a chemical that makes you feel good. This initial surge of dopamine is what creates that euphoric feeling.
* **The Cycle:**  But, as your brain gets used to the constant dopamine rush, you need more of the drug to get the same feeling. This is how addiction starts. 
* **Withdrawal:** When you stop using the drug, your brain goes into withdrawal. This can be really tough, and it's often what makes people want to keep using.


So, while that initial feeling of euphoria is tempting, it's important to remember that it's often just the beginning of a dangerous cycle. 


**Is euphoria associated with drug addiction?**

(A) Yes
(B) No

"No, a dichromat would likely have difficulty distinguishing between chlorine gas and neon gas.  

Here's why:

* **Dichromats** have a limited range of color vision. They can't see certain colors as clearly as people with normal color vision.
* Chlorine gas and neon gas are colorless. 
*  While chlorine gas has a distinct odor, neon gas is a noble gas and doesn't have a color. 


So, a dichromat would rely on other senses to identify them.

"Hornets actually do provide some interesting data for oceanographers!  They are part of a complex web of life that connects land and sea.  

Here's why:

* **Food Webs:**  Hornets are predators, and their diet often includes insects that are important for the health of marine ecosystems.  By studying hornet populations, scientists can get a better understanding of the abundance and distribution of these insects, which can tell us a lot about the overall health of the food web.
* **Pollination:**  Some species of hornets are pollinators, which means they help plants reproduce.  This is important because many plants are crucial for the health of marine ecosystems. 
* **Climate Change:**  Changes in hornet populations can be linked to climate change, which can impact the ocean's health.  Studying these changes can help scientists understand the broader effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.

So, while hornets aren't directly measured in oceanographic data, their presence and behavior can provide valuable information about the broader ecosystem and its health.

Think of it like this: your muscles need energy to work, and they get that energy through a process called anaerobic respiration.  This process is like a quick burst of power, but it also creates a little bit of waste, which is lactic acid.  

Now, this isn't necessarily bad.  Your body is pretty good at clearing out lactic acid, and it actually helps your muscles get stronger and more efficient.  But, if you're pushing yourself really hard, and that lactic acid builds up, it can cause that burning feeling in your muscles, and it can make you feel tired. 

So, is it bad?  Well, it depends.  It's a natural part of exercise, but too much of it can be a problem.

"No, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would absolutely not support trickle-down economics.  

Here's why:

* **Centralized Planning:** The Soviet Union's economic system was based on centralized planning, where the government controlled all aspects of production and distribution. Trickle-down economics relies on market forces and private ownership, which the Soviets would see as fundamentally opposed to their system.
* **Social Equality:** Communism aims for a classless society, where everyone has equal access to resources and opportunities. Trickle-down economics, by concentrating wealth at the top, would actually exacerbate inequality and go against the core principles of communism.
* **Collective Good:**  The Soviet Union's focus was on the collective good, ensuring everyone had access to basic necessities. Trickle-down economics, with its emphasis on individual wealth accumulation, would be seen as prioritizing the interests of the wealthy over the needs of the many. 


So, no, trickle-down economics would be completely at odds with the Soviet Union's economic and social goals.

* **Competition:**  The UK grocery market is very competitive, and a merger between Sainsbury's and Tesco would face intense scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). They would likely block the deal due to concerns about market dominance and potential price increases for consumers.
* **Market Share:** Both Sainsbury's and Tesco are already major players in the UK grocery market. A merger would create a dominant force, which could lead to reduced competition and potentially higher prices for shoppers. 
* **Strategic Considerations:**  Each company has its own strengths and weaknesses. A merger might not be the best strategic move for either, and they might be better off focusing on their own growth and development.

"The Jungle Book, while a beloved classic, does contain elements that have been criticized for perpetuating harmful stereotypes.  

**The answer is: Yes.**

It's important to remember that the story was written in a different time period, and its portrayal of certain characters and cultures should be viewed through that lens.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes:** The story relies on stereotypes of Native Americans, often portraying them as ""noble savages"" who are inherently dangerous and untrustworthy. This reinforces harmful and inaccurate portrayals of Indigenous cultures.
* **Animal Personification:** The animals in the story are often given human-like qualities and behaviors, which can be problematic as it can lead to the misrepresentation of animal behavior and reinforce the idea that animals are less than human.
* **Colonialist Undertones:** The story is set in a romanticized version of the Indian subcontinent, often ignoring the complex realities of colonialism and its impact on Indigenous communities.


It's important to approach classic literature with a critical eye, considering the historical context and potential for bias.

"No, Japanese serfdom did not have higher status than English serfdom. 

Here's why:

* **Samurai** were a distinct social class in Japan with a high degree of social status and power. They were landowners and held land in their own name.

While both systems involved obligations and limited freedoms, the social standing and rights of the people within each system were vastly different.

These are from different historical periods and therefore their numbers are not comparable. 


"
"It's a complicated question, isn't it?  While *The Catcher in the Rye* is a powerful and influential novel, it's not a direct cause of violence.  

Here's why:

* **The novel explores complex themes:**  Holden Caulfield's cynicism, rebellion, and disillusionment with the adult world resonate with some individuals who feel misunderstood or alienated.  
* **It's a reflection of a time:** The novel was written in the 1950s, a time of social change and questioning of traditional values.  
* **It's open to interpretation:**  The novel's themes can be interpreted in many ways, and it's not a simple cause-and-effect situation.

So, while *The Catcher in the Rye* has been analyzed in relation to violence, it's important to remember that it's just one piece of a much larger puzzle.

"Woodrow Wilson would likely have supported the Plessy v. Ferguson decision.  

Here's why:

* **Wilson was a strong advocate for states' rights.** He believed in the idea that states should have the power to make their own laws, and he saw the issue of racial segregation as a matter for the states to decide.
* **He believed in the concept of ""separate but equal.""**  This doctrine, upheld by the Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson, allowed for racial segregation as long as facilities for different races were considered equal. Wilson, while not always vocal about it, supported this idea.
* **Wilson's views on race were complex.** He was a product of his time, and his views on race evolved over time. However, he was generally supportive of the idea of racial segregation and believed it was a necessary part of maintaining social order.

**Therefore, Dave has Catch-22 at the end.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob starts with a yellow ball, Alice starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Alice gets the yellow ball and Bob gets the orange ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with a white ball, Alice starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Eve gets the yellow ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob starts with a yellow ball, Dave starts with a blue ball. They swap, so Dave gets the yellow ball and Bob gets the blue ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with a blue ball, Alice starts with a white ball. They swap, so Alice gets the blue ball and Bob gets the white ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with a red ball, Bob starts with a white ball. They swap, so Bob gets the red ball and Claire gets the white ball.

**Therefore, Alice ends up with the blue ball.** 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"The answer is **(C) Moby Dick**. 

Here's how we can figure that out:

Let's track the trades:

1. **Initial:** Alice - Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob - The Odyssey, Claire - Ulysses, Dave - Catch-22, Eve - Moby Dick

2. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Dave gets Moby Dick.

3. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets Moby Dick, Eve gets Catch-22.

4. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets Ulysses, Bob gets Catch-22.

5. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Alice gets Moby Dick.

6. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Ulysses, Claire gets Moby Dick.

Now, we see that Claire ends up with Moby Dick. 



"
"The final ball Alice has is the blue ball. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Alice has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Bob has *The Odyssey*, Claire has *Frankenstein*, Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and Eve has *Ulysses*.

2. **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Claire now has *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Alice has *Frankenstein*.

3. **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Alice has *Frankenstein*.

4. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire now has *The Odyssey* and Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

5. **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has *The Odyssey* and Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

"Okay, so let's break down the trades:

* **Start:** Dave is Center Midfielder, Bob is Right Midfielder, Claire is Right Winger, Alice is Benchwarmer, Eve is Left Winger.

* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes Right Winger, Bob becomes Center Midfielder.

* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Center Midfielder.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes Left Winger, Eve becomes Right Winger.

* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Claire becomes Right Winger.

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave becomes Left Winger, Eve becomes Center Midfielder.

**So, Dave is now playing Left Winger!** 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The final position Claire is playing is Left Winger.  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The final dance swap is Dave and Rodrigo.  

The answer is **(A) Rodrigo**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve ends up with Dave's ball, and Dave ends up with Eve's ball.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice ends up with Bob's ball, and Bob ends up with Alice's ball.

"Claire ends up with Ulysses!  

The correct answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve ends up with the brown ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is the benchwarmer, Alice is the right winger, Claire is the right midfielder, Dave is the goalkeeper, and Eve is the cheerleader.

* **Trade 1:** Bob and Alice switch positions. Bob becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.

* **Trade 2:** Dave and Claire switch positions. Dave becomes the right midfielder, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 3:** Alice and Claire switch positions. Alice becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes the right winger.

* **Trade 4:** Eve and Alice switch positions. Eve becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 5:** Dave and Bob switch positions. Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.

"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

* **Start:**  Alice has Moby Dick, Bob has Lolita, Claire has The Great Gatsby, Dave has Catch-22, and Eve has Ulysses.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire now has Catch-22 and Dave has The Great Gatsby.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob now has The Great Gatsby and Claire has Catch-22.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Dave now has Ulysses and Alice has Catch-22.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave now has Ulysses and Claire has Catch-22.

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire now has Ulysses.

**Therefore, Claire ends up with Ulysses.** 


The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Claire is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **We know:** Alice has purple, Bob has white, Claire has brown, Dave has red, and Eve has yellow.
* **Swaps:** We need to figure out what happens to each color. 

**The key is that the gifts are swapped, and we don't know what they swapped.** 

**Therefore, we can't determine the final gift.** 

**The answer is (None of the above)** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the dance moves! 

Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Sam, and Claire is with Bob. 

Then Bob and Eve switch partners, so Bob is now with Eve, and Eve is with Sam.

Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Eve, and Bob is with Melissa.

Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Bob, and Bob is with Melissa.

Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Dave, and Claire is with Bob.

So, Bob is dancing with Melissa at the end of the dance. 


The answer is (A). 



"
"The answer is **(E) black ball**. 

Here's why:

The gifts are swapped in a series of pairs.  Since Claire and Dave swap gifts, and Eve and Dave swap gifts, the gifts are not changed. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can break down the trades:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Pearl
    * Dave: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Eve: Hound of the Baskervilles

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve now has The Pearl and Claire has Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob now has Hound of the Baskervilles and Eve has The Pearl.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire now has The Fellowship of the Ring and Dave has The Pearl.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob now has The Pearl and Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice now has The Fellowship of the Ring and Bob has The Pearl.

**Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.** 


**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Eve ends up dancing with the person who was originally dancing with Alice.  

The answer is **(C) Ophelia.** 



"
"The answer is **(C) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's pink ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.
2. Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's orange ball, Dave gets Bob's pink ball.
3. Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets Claire's black ball, Claire gets Eve's brown present.

"
"Eve is playing Left Midfielder at the end of the match. 

The correct answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The final ball Dave ends up with is the green ball.

1. **Bob and Alice swap:**  This doesn't change Eve's book.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:** This doesn't change Eve's book.

"Eve ends up with the green ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the balls are distributed after each swap:

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Alice's ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  Claire gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Claire's ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Claire gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Claire's ball.

**Bob starts with a purple ball.** 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets the orange ball and Claire gets the black ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets the blue ball and Bob gets the red ball.
3. **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve gets the black ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets the red ball and Bob gets the brown ball.
5. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave gets the orange ball and Eve gets the black ball.

So, the final ball Alice has is the **blue ball**.

"The answer is **(A) Ulysses**. 

Here's why:

Let's follow the trades as they happen:

1. **Start:** Bob has *Moby Dick*.
2. **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets *Frankenstein*, Eve gets *Ulysses*.
3. **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets *Ulysses*, Dave gets *Frankenstein*.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets *The Pearl*, Bob gets *Ulysses*.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Bob gets *Ulysses*.
6. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets *The Pearl*, Eve gets *Frankenstein*.

Bob ends up with *Ulysses*. 



"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Initial Ownership:**  Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Frankenstein*, Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and Eve has *Ulysses*.

2. **Eve and Alice Swap:** Eve's book becomes Alice's, and Alice's book becomes Eve's. This means Eve now has *The Great Gatsby* and Alice now has *Ulysses*.

3. **Dave and Bob Swap:** Dave's book becomes Bob's, and Bob's book becomes Dave's. This means Dave now has *Ulysses* and Bob now has *Frankenstein*.

4. **Eve and Claire Swap:** Eve's book becomes Claire's, and Claire's book becomes Eve's. This means Eve now has *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Claire now has *Ulysses*.

5. **Bob and Alice Swap:** Bob's book becomes Alice's, and Alice's book becomes Bob's. This means Bob now has *Frankenstein* and Alice now has *Ulysses*.

6. **Claire and Dave Swap:** Claire's book becomes Dave's, and Dave's book becomes Claire's. This means Claire now has *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Dave now has *Ulysses*.

**Therefore, Bob ends up with Frankenstein.** 


**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Claire ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The final position Alice ends up in is right winger!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) Lolita**. 

Here's why:

Let's track the trades:

1. **Initial Ownership:** Alice has *The Pearl*, Bob has *Catch-22*, Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Dave has *Lolita*, and Eve has *Ulysses*.

2. **Claire and Alice Swap:**  Claire now has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Alice has *The Pearl*.

3. **Dave and Alice Swap:** Dave now has *Lolita*, and Alice has *The Pearl*.

4. **Eve and Bob Swap:** Eve now has *Catch-22*, and Bob has *Ulysses*.

5. **Dave and Bob Swap:** Dave now has *Lolita*, and Bob has *Ulysses*.

6. **Bob and Claire Swap:** Bob now has *Ulysses*, and Claire has *Lolita*.

"
"Okay, let's break down the dance moves! 

Here's the key:

* **Dave and Eve switch partners:** Dave - Izzi, Eve - Bob
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** Bob - Melissa, Claire - Rodrigo
* **Bob and Eve switch partners:** Bob - Izzi, Eve - Claire
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:** Claire - Rodrigo, Alice - Bob

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Izzi at the end.** 

The answer is **(A)**.

"The answer is **(C) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice:**  Claire starts with a black ball, Alice starts with a brown ball.
2. **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with a black ball, Alice starts with a purple ball.
3. **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with a purple ball, Dave starts with a yellow ball.
4. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with a yellow ball, Claire starts with a green ball.
5. **Alice and Bob:** Bob starts with a purple ball, Alice starts with a brown ball.

"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Eve starts with a black ball.  We know that Claire and Dave swap gifts, and then Bob and Claire swap gifts.  Then, Claire and Dave swap gifts again.  Finally, Alice and Eve swap gifts. 

The only way Eve could end up with the black ball is if she received it from someone else. 

The answer is **(A) black ball.** 



"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the book swaps work:

1. **Start:** Alice has Ulysses, Bob has Frankenstein, Claire has Moby Dick, Dave has Lolita, and Eve has The Pearl.

2. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire now has The Pearl, and Eve has Moby Dick.

3. **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave now has Moby Dick, and Bob has Lolita.

4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire now has Lolita, and Bob has Moby Dick.

5. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve now has Moby Dick, and Bob has Lolita.

6. **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave now has Lolita, and Alice has Ulysses.

**Therefore, Dave ends up with Lolita.** 

The answer is **(C)**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave ends up with Patrick because of the final switch.  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts will end up:

* **Dave and Eve:**  They swap, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's present.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Eve's present and Eve gets Claire's present.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Dave's present and Dave gets Bob's present.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's present.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Dave's present and Dave gets Alice's present.

**The final gift is the one that Dave received in the last swap.**

"The final book Dave ends up with is **(D) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Dave's book (The Odyssey), Alice gets Eve's book (Frankenstein).
2. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets Eve's book (Frankenstein), Eve gets Bob's book (Moby Dick).
3. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book (The Odyssey), Dave gets Claire's book (The Fellowship of the Ring). 


Let me know if you have any other book-related puzzles for me! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can break down the gift exchange:

* **Start:** Alice has red, Bob has black, Claire has pink, Dave has orange, and Eve has brown.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

**The answer is:**  We can't determine the final gift Alice has. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Alice and Eve:**  Alice starts with yellow, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow and Alice gets the green.
2. **Bob and Dave:**  Bob starts with orange, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Dave gets the orange and Bob gets the purple.
3. **Bob and Eve:** Bob gets the green from Eve, and Eve gets the orange from Bob.
4. **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with red, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the red and Claire gets the green.
5. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets the orange from Bob, and Alice gets the purple from Dave.

**Dave ends up with the green present.**

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Eve ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The final position Alice ends up in is Center Midfielder!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve it:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob's ball becomes Dave's present, and Dave's ball becomes Bob's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Dave's present, and Dave's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Eve's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's present, and Bob's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Dave's present.

**The final gift is Claire's present.**

"Claire is dancing with Bob!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's break down the dance moves! 

Bob and Eve switch partners first, then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Eve and Bob switch partners again, then Dave and Alice switch partners, and finally Eve and Claire switch partners.  

This means that Bob is dancing with Ophelia at the end. 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's break it down! 

We know the positions are:

* Bob: Center midfielder
* Claire: Fullback
* Dave: Striker
* Alice: Benchwarmer
* Eve: Left winger

Here's what happens:

1. Dave and Eve switch positions.
2. Dave and Claire switch positions.
3. Eve and Dave switch positions.
4. Bob and Alice switch positions.
5. Eve and Alice switch positions.

The final position for Bob is **(E) benchwarmer**.

"Eve ends up with the brown ball!  The final swap leaves her with the brown ball. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Claire and Bob:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Bob and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.

**The key is that each swap involves two people trading, and the colors are always changing.**

**Therefore, Dave will have the blue ball at the end.** 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts are being swapped:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now with Alice, and Alice's present is now with Claire. 
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Bob.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Alice.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Bob.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Dave.

**The final gift is Dave's present.  The answer is (A) yellow present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives her black ball to Eve, and Eve gets Alice's black ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives his yellow ball to Claire, and Claire gets Dave's yellow ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gives his yellow ball to Eve, and Eve gets Dave's yellow ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives her orange ball to Eve, and Eve gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob gives his green ball to Eve, and Eve gets Bob's green ball.

Eve ends up with all the balls that were originally held by the other players.  

**Therefore, the answer is (E) green ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final ball Alice has:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob's ball becomes Alice's, and Alice's ball becomes Bob's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's ball becomes Claire's, and Claire's ball becomes Alice's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve's ball becomes Alice's, and Alice's ball becomes Eve's.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire's ball becomes Bob's, and Bob's ball becomes Claire's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's ball becomes Dave's, and Dave's ball becomes Claire's.

**The answer is (C) black ball.** 



"
"Eve ends up with the orange ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance moves play out:

1.  **Start:**  Bob is with Izzi, Claire is with Lola, Dave is with Sam, Eve is with Melissa, and Alice is with Ophelia.

2.  **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire is now with Sam, and Bob is with Izzi.

3.  **Claire and Eve switch:**  Claire is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Sam.

4.  **Bob and Dave switch:**  Bob is now with Sam, and Dave is with Izzi.

5.  **Claire and Eve switch:**  Claire is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Sam.

6.  **Alice and Eve switch:**  Alice is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Sam.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final gift:

* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her present, and Alice gives Eve her present.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Claire his present.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Alice her present.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her present, and Eve gives Alice her present.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Dave his present.

**The final gift is the one that was originally given to Bob.** 

So the answer is **(C) black ball.** 



"
"The final ball holder is Dave!  He ends up with the blue ball. 

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Here's how the positions change:

1. **Start:** Alice is benchwarmer, Bob is fullback, Claire is left winger, Dave is right midfielder, and Eve is left midfielder.

2. **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave moves to left midfielder, Alice moves to right midfielder.

3. **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve moves to right midfielder, Bob moves to left winger.

4. **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire moves to right midfielder, Dave moves to left winger.

5. **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice moves to left winger, Eve moves to right midfielder.

6. **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice moves to fullback, Bob moves to left winger.

**Final Positions:**

* **Alice:** Fullback
* **Bob:** Left Winger
* **Claire:** Right Midfielder
* **Dave:** Left Winger
* **Eve:** Right Midfielder

**So the answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire gets a new ball, and Eve gets a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets the purple and Dave gets the black.

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets the yellow and Eve gets the black.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets the green and Claire gets the purple.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets the black and Bob gets the green.

2. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice starts with an orange ball, and Dave now has the brown ball. They swap, so Alice now has the brown ball and Dave has the orange ball.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has the brown ball, and Claire starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Claire now has the brown ball and Alice has the yellow ball.
4. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave now has the orange ball, and Bob starts with a white ball. They swap, so Dave now has the white ball and Bob has the orange ball.
5. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve now has the orange ball, and Dave now has the brown ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the yellow ball.**

3. Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire gets The Odyssey
4. Alice and Claire swap: Alice gets The Odyssey, Claire gets The Fellowship of the Ring
5. Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire gets The Odyssey

This means that after all the trades, Alice ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Sam, and Claire is with Bob.  Then Bob and Eve switch partners, so Bob is now with Eve, and Eve is with Sam.  Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Eve, and Bob is with Melissa.  Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Bob, and Bob is with Melissa.  Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Dave, and Claire is with Bob. 

So, Dave is dancing with Melissa. 


The answer is (A). 
"
"Eve ends up with Izzi!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

Alice starts with Helga.  Then, she switches partners with Claire, then Bob, then Dave, and finally Eve.  The last switch is Eve and Bob.  

So, the final answer is **(E) Helga**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is benchwarmer, Bob is left midfielder, Claire is left winger, Dave is center midfielder, and Eve is striker.

2. **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Dave becomes striker.

3. **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes left winger, Alice becomes center midfielder.

4. **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes left winger, Bob becomes center midfielder.

5. **Bob and Eve trade:** Bob becomes striker, Eve becomes left winger.

6. **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes left winger, Dave becomes center midfielder.

**Final Position:** Bob is now playing **(B) left midfielder**. 



 
"
"The answer is **(A)**.  Claire ends up with the pink ball. 

Here's why:

* Eve and Bob swap, then Eve and Dave swap, then Alice and Eve swap, then Alice and Claire swap, and finally Claire and Dave swap. 
*  This means the pink ball is passed around the group. 
*  Claire ends up with the pink ball. 



"
"Eve ends up with Karl!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We know Alice has a brown present, Bob has a black ball, Claire has a blue present, Dave has an orange ball, and Eve has a red present.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Eve's.

**The final gift is the one that was originally Claire's.** 

**The answer is (D) blue present.** 



"
"The final dance partner for Alice is Rodrigo! 

The correct answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Eve ends up playing striker!  

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with orange, Bob starts with white. They swap, so Bob gets orange and Eve gets white.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with green, Eve starts with white. They swap, so Eve gets green and Claire gets white.
3. **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with pink, Eve starts with white. They swap, so Eve gets pink and Alice gets white.
4. **Dave and Alice:** Dave starts with brown, Alice starts with white. They swap, so Alice gets brown and Dave gets white.
5. **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with orange, Alice starts with white. They swap, so Alice gets orange and Bob gets white.

**Therefore, Bob ends up with the white ball.** 

The answer is **(C) white ball.** 



"
"Eve ends up with *The Odyssey*.  

The correct answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change anything, as they both start with different colors.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Eve's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Eve's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Dave's.

**The final gift is Dave's present, which is the original color of the gift that Eve had.**

**Answer: (B) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

* **Start:** Alice has *The Great Gatsby*, Bob has *Frankenstein*, Claire has *The Pearl*, Dave has *Catch-22*, and Eve has *Ulysses*.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means they switch books, so we'll have to figure out who gets what. 

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they switch books, so we'll have to figure out who gets what. 

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they switch books, so we'll have to figure out who gets what. 

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they switch books, so we'll have to figure out who gets what. 

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means they switch books, so we'll have to figure out who gets what. 

**The final answer is (E) Frankenstein.** 



"
"Okay, so let's break down the positions! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is fullback, Bob is right midfielder, Claire is cheerleader, Dave is right winger, and Eve is center midfielder.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes right winger, Eve becomes cheerleader.

* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes cheerleader, Claire becomes right midfielder.

* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes right winger, Dave becomes right midfielder.

* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes cheerleader, Claire becomes right midfielder.

* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes center midfielder, Eve becomes right winger.

**Final Position:** Bob is now playing right winger. 


**Answer: (D)**

"
"Eve is dancing with Patrick at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"The answer is **(B) Lola**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:** Bob - Lola, Claire - Sam, Dave - Patrick, Eve - Jamie, Alice - Izzi
2. **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire - Sam, Eve - Alice
3. **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave - Izzi, Alice - Sam
4. **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire - Patrick, Dave - Sam
5. **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire - Lola, Alice - Jamie

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.

**The key is that each swap involves two people exchanging gifts.**

* **Dave and Bob:**  They swap, so Dave now has Bob's gift.
* **Claire and Eve:**  They swap, so Claire now has Eve's gift.

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire gets the brown present and Alice gets the orange ball.
2. **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets the pink ball and Bob gets the orange ball.
3. **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets the orange ball and Claire gets the pink ball.
4. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets the pink ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
5. **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets the pink ball and Alice gets the black ball.

**So, the final gift is the orange ball!** 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The answer is (A).  Bob ends up dancing with Izzi. 
 
Let me know if you have any other dance-related questions! 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the trades:

* **Start:** Bob is striker, Dave is center midfielder, Eve is right midfielder, Alice is goalkeeper, and Claire is cheerleader.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Dave becomes right midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes striker, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes cheerleader, Claire becomes center midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes striker, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Bob becomes goalkeeper, Alice becomes striker.

So, Bob ends up playing goalkeeper! 


The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 

Here's why:

Let's follow the trades as they happen:

1. **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Claire now has Eve's book.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice now has Bob's book.
3. **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave now has Alice's book.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has Bob's book.
5. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has Eve's book.

Since Eve started with Hound of the Baskervilles, and the final swap puts Bob with Eve's book, Claire must have the Hound of the Baskervilles. 



"
"The answer is **(C) The Pearl**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gets Bob's book, Alice gets Eve's book.
2. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, Bob gets Alice's book.
3. **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Bob's book, Bob gets Claire's book.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gets Dave's book, Dave gets Eve's book.
5. **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets Claire's book, Claire gets Bob's book.

This means Claire ends up with the book she received from Bob in the last swap. 



"
"Dave ends up as the goalkeeper!  He starts as the benchwarmer, then gets to be the fullback, then the striker, and finally ends up in goal.  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the dance swaps:

1. Eve and Alice switch partners. This means Eve is now with Bob, and Alice is now with Dave.
2. Dave and Claire switch partners. This means Dave is now with Eve, and Claire is now with Bob.
3. Claire and Eve switch partners. This means Claire is now with Dave, and Eve is now with Bob.
4. Bob and Alice switch partners. This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is now with Dave.
5. Bob and Dave switch partners. This means Bob is now with Eve, and Dave is now with Claire.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with **Claire**.

"The answer is **(A) Frankenstein**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

2. **Dave and Alice:** Dave starts with Frankenstein, Alice starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob starts with Moby Dick, Claire starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
4. **Alice and Dave:** Alice starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with Frankenstein.
5. **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob starts with Moby Dick.

The final trade leaves Alice with Frankenstein.

"Claire is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice starts with yellow, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Alice gets green and Eve gets yellow.
2. **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob starts with orange, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Bob gets purple and Dave gets orange.
3. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob now has purple, Eve has yellow. They swap, so Bob gets yellow and Eve gets purple.
4. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire starts with red, Eve starts with yellow. They swap, so Claire gets yellow and Eve gets red.
5. **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave now has orange, Alice has green. They swap, so Dave gets green and Alice gets orange.

We know that Dave and Claire swap gifts, and then Dave and Eve swap gifts.  This means that Claire starts with a black ball and Eve starts with a green present.  Then, Alice and Claire swap gifts, and Eve and Alice swap gifts.  Finally, Bob and Dave swap gifts. 

So, the final gift is the one that Claire has. 

The answer is **(A) orange ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(C) blue ball**.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Claire and Bob swap, so they end up with each other's balls.
2. Claire and Alice swap, so Alice now has Claire's ball.
3. Dave and Eve swap, so they end up with each other's balls.
4. Bob and Alice swap, so Alice now has Bob's ball.

"
"Okay, so let's break down the positions! 

* **Start:** Alice is the benchwarmer, Bob is the right midfielder, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the striker, and Eve is the left winger.

* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the left winger, Eve becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes the left winger, Alice becomes the cheerleader.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the cheerleader, Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes the striker, Dave becomes the left winger.

**So, Bob is now playing striker!**

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: Ulysses
    * Dave: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.

**The key is to understand that the swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

**The only way to determine Claire's book is to look at the final order.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the book trades work:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Lolita
    * Claire: The Great Gatsby
    * Dave: Catch-22
    * Eve: Ulysses

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This leaves us with:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Lolita
    * Claire: The Great Gatsby
    * Dave: Catch-22
    * Eve: Ulysses

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This leaves us with:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Dave and Alice swap:** This leaves us with:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Dave and Claire swap:** This leaves us with:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Claire and Eve swap:** This leaves us with:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

**Therefore, Bob has Ulysses at the end of the semester.**

**Answer: (E)** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Eve starts with a pink ball.  Then, Eve and Alice swap gifts.  Eve gets the green present, and Alice gets the pink ball.  

Next, Dave and Bob swap gifts. Dave gets the orange ball, and Bob gets the red present.

Then, Claire and Dave swap gifts. Claire gets the red present, and Dave gets the white present.

Finally, Eve and Claire swap gifts. Eve gets the white present, and Claire gets the pink ball.

So, Eve ends up with the pink ball. 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the dance moves! 

Bob and Eve switch partners first, then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then Dave and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners.  

So, the final dance partners are:

* Bob - Claire
* Eve - Ophelia
* Alice - Jamie
* Dave - Izzi
* Rodrigo - Lola 


 
The answer is **(C) Jamie**. 
"
"Okay, let's break down the dance moves! 

* **Start:** Dave is with Jamie.
* **Claire and Alice switch:**  Claire is now with Dave, and Alice is with someone else.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve is now with Dave, and Alice is with someone else.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire is now with someone else, and Dave is with someone else.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave is now with someone else, and Bob is with someone else.

2. **Alice and Claire:** Alice starts with a black ball, Claire starts with a red ball.
3. **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with a red ball, Alice starts with a green ball.
4. **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with a red ball, Bob starts with a green ball.
5. **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with a green ball, Dave starts with a white ball.

"Okay, so let's break down the trades:

* **Start:** Alice is the cheerleader, Bob is the benchwarmer, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the fullback, and Eve is the right midfielder.

* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the benchwarmer, Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the fullback, Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes the right winger, Dave becomes the fullback.

So, Bob is now playing the right winger! 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Eve gets the blue present!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Claire is playing right winger!  

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Dave has Ulysses, Alice has Catch-22, Bob has Moby Dick, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve has The Great Gatsby.

2. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

3. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

5. **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

6. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

**The final answer is (E).** 



 
"
"The final gift Dave ends up with is the **red present**. 

Here's why:

* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her pink ball, Alice gives Eve her green present.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his red present, Bob gives Dave his orange ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives Dave his white present, Dave gives Claire her red present.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her green present, Claire gives Eve her white present.

"The answer is **(D) Helga**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the dance changes:

1. Dave starts with Patrick.
2. Bob and Claire switch partners.
3. Eve and Dave switch partners.
4. Bob and Dave switch partners.
5. Alice and Bob switch partners.
6. Bob and Eve switch partners. 

This means Dave ends up with Helga.

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Alice starts with The Pearl.**
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Alice and Bob swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Eve and Alice swap books.** This means they both traded books.

**Therefore, Alice has Catch-22 at the end.** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"The final ball Dave ends up with is the brown ball. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the trades:

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve moves to Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Center Midfielder.
* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes Right Midfielder, Alice becomes Left Winger.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes Center Midfielder, Eve becomes Right Midfielder.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes Goalkeeper, Claire becomes Left Winger.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Goalkeeper, Claire becomes Left Winger.

**Bob is now playing Goalkeeper.** 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the moves:

* **Start:** Alice is the goalie, Bob is the left midfielder, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the striker, and Eve is the center midfielder.

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice becomes the right winger, and Claire becomes the goalie.

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice becomes the left midfielder, and Bob becomes the goalie.

* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the striker.

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the right winger.

* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the striker.

**Final Position:**  Alice is now the center midfielder. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a brown ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.

**Dave ends up with the orange ball.** 

The answer is **(B).** 



"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Alice has Lolita, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has Ulysses, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve has The Odyssey.

2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets Lolita and Alice gets The Great Gatsby.

3. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Ulysses and Claire gets The Odyssey.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets The Great Gatsby and Bob gets Lolita.

5. **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets The Odyssey and Eve gets The Fellowship of the Ring.

6. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey and Eve gets Ulysses.

**Therefore, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring at the end.** 


The answer is **(D)**.

The answer is **(E).** 
"
"The final gift Alice has is the orange ball. 

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

* **Alice and Claire:**  Alice starts with red, Claire starts with blue. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with white, Alice starts with red. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with pink, Alice starts with red. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with blue, Dave starts with brown. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice - Striker, Bob - Fullback, Claire - Left Winger, Dave - Center Midfielder, Eve - Benchwarmer

* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire (Left Winger) becomes Fullback, Bob (Fullback) becomes Left Winger.

* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave (Center Midfielder) becomes Left Winger, Claire (Fullback) becomes Center Midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice (Striker) becomes Fullback, Bob (Left Winger) becomes Striker.

* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve (Benchwarmer) becomes Center Midfielder, Dave (Left Winger) becomes Benchwarmer.

* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice (Fullback) becomes Center Midfielder, Dave (Benchwarmer) becomes Striker.

**Final Position:** Bob is now playing **(B) Striker**. 



 
"
"The answer is **(B) Ulysses**.

1. **Initial Ownership:**
   * Alice: The Pearl
   * Bob: Frankenstein
   * Claire: Ulysses
   * Dave: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Eve: Moby Dick

2. **Bob and Dave Swap:**  This leaves Bob with Ulysses and Dave with Frankenstein.
3. **Bob and Claire Swap:** This leaves Bob with Hound of the Baskervilles and Claire with Ulysses.
4. **Dave and Claire Swap:** This leaves Dave with Moby Dick and Claire with Hound of the Baskervilles.
5. **Claire and Bob Swap:** This leaves Claire with Frankenstein and Bob with Moby Dick.
6. **Alice and Eve Swap:** This leaves Alice with Moby Dick and Eve with Frankenstein.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Initial State:**
   * Alice: Purple
   * Bob: White
   * Claire: Yellow
   * Dave: Pink
   * Eve: Green

2. **Claire and Alice Swap:**  Claire's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Claire.  This changes the state to:
   * Alice: Yellow
   * Claire: Purple

3. **Claire and Bob Swap:** Claire's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Claire. This changes the state to:
   * Bob: Yellow
   * Claire: Purple

4. **Dave and Alice Swap:** Dave's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Dave. This changes the state to:
   * Alice: Pink
   * Dave: Purple

5. **Eve and Dave Swap:** Eve's present goes to Dave, and Dave's present goes to Eve. This changes the state to:
   * Dave: Green
   * Eve: Pink

6. **Alice and Bob Swap:** Alice's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Alice. This changes the state to:
   * Bob: Green
   * Alice: Pink

**Therefore, Bob has the green present (B).** 



"
"The answer is **(B) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Bob and Eve swap:  Bob starts with an orange ball, Eve starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Eve now has an orange ball and Bob has a brown ball.
2. Eve and Dave swap: Eve now has an orange ball, Dave now has a brown ball.
3. Dave and Alice swap: Dave now has a brown ball, Alice now has a green ball.
4. Alice and Claire swap: Alice now has a green ball, Claire now has a brown ball.
5. Bob and Claire swap: Bob now has a brown ball, Claire now has a green ball.

Dave ends up with the green ball.

"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match!  

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's break down the dance moves! 

Here's the key:

* **Dave and Eve switch partners:**  This means Dave is now with Jamie, and Eve is now with Dave.
* **Alice and Claire switch partners:** This means Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Claire is now with Dave.
* **Dave and Bob switch partners:** This means Dave is now with Melissa, and Bob is now with Eve.
* **Alice and Eve switch partners:** This means Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Eve is now with Dave.

"
"Eve is dancing with Helga!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Bob swap, so Eve gets Bob's blue ball and Bob gets Eve's green ball.  Then Dave and Claire swap, so Dave gets Claire's brown ball and Claire gets Dave's red ball.  

Next, Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's blue ball and Eve gets Alice's yellow ball.  Then Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Alice's yellow ball.  Finally, Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Bob's yellow ball. 

So, the final ball is Bob's blue ball. 


The answer is **(E) blue ball.**

3. **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with a yellow ball, Dave starts with a green ball.
4. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with a green ball, Claire starts with a black ball.
5. **Alice and Bob:** Bob starts with a purple ball, Alice starts with a brown ball. 



 
"
"Okay, let's break down the swaps! 

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

**The key is to see that each swap results in a new ball being held by each player.**

"Eve is dancing with Dave at the end of the dance.  The answer is **(B) Helga.** 
"
"The answer is **(A) orange ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Dave swap, Dave gets the orange ball.
2. Bob and Claire swap, Claire gets the black ball.
3. Claire and Dave swap, Dave gets the pink ball.
4. Dave and Bob swap, Bob gets the orange ball.
5. Alice and Eve swap, Alice gets the red ball. 


Let me know if you'd like to play another game! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance moves break down:

1. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
2. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
3. **Alice and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**

This means that Bob is dancing with someone new at the end of the dance. 

**The answer is (B) Rodrigo.** 



"
"Eve ends up with the red ball!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The final gift Alice has is the purple present. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets the purple present and Alice gets the orange ball.  Then Bob and Dave swap, so Bob gets the blue present and Dave gets the brown present.  Then Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets the purple present and Alice gets the blue present.  Then Claire and Eve swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.  Finally, Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present. 

**Therefore, Claire ends up with the purple present.**

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is in the center midfield, Bob is a fullback, Claire is the goalkeeper, Dave is a left winger, and Eve is a right winger.

2. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the right winger.

3. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice becomes the left winger, and Dave becomes the center midfielder.

4. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

5. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, and Alice becomes the right winger.

"The final position Dave ends up in is left midfielder. 

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"The final swap is Bob giving Alice his ball.  This means Bob now has the red ball. 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) black ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire starts with a black ball, and Dave starts with a white ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a yellow ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with a black ball, and Bob starts with a pink ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with a black ball. 



Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Dave starts as the center midfielder.  We know there are a few trades, and we need to see how they affect Dave's position. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes cheerleader, Alice becomes right midfielder.
2. **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire becomes striker, Fred becomes right winger.
3. **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes striker, Fred becomes fullback.
4. **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes striker, Fred becomes fullback.
5. **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes goalkeeper, Gertrude becomes striker.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

**1.  Start with the initial ownership:**

* Alice: Ulysses
* Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring
* Claire: The Odyssey
* Dave: Lolita
* Eve: Hound of the Baskervilles
* Fred: Frankenstein
* Gertrude: The Great Gatsby

**2.  Let's track the swaps:**

* Fred and Dave swap:  Fred gets Dave's book, Dave gets Fred's book.
* Alice and Claire swap: Alice gets Claire's book, Claire gets Alice's book.
* Eve and Dave swap: Eve gets Dave's book, Dave gets Eve's book.
* Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets Eve's book, Eve gets Bob's book.
* Gertrude and Claire swap: Gertrude gets Claire's book, Claire gets Gertrude's book.
* Eve and Gertrude swap: Eve gets Gertrude's book, Gertrude gets Eve's book.
* Dave and Bob swap: Dave gets Bob's book, Bob gets Dave's book.

**3.  The final ownership:**

* **Fred:**  Fred's book is Frankenstein.
* **Dave:** Dave's book is Lolita.
* **Eve:** Eve's book is Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Bob:** Bob's book is The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude's book is The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice:** Alice's book is Ulysses.
* **Claire:** Claire's book is The Odyssey.


 
Let me know if you have any other book-related puzzles!

"Eve ends up with the ball that was originally held by Fred.  The answer is (A) red ball. 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Start:**  Each person has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who ends up with which ball.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

1. **Claire and Dave:**  Claire's ball is swapped with Dave's.
2. **Fred and Eve:** Fred's ball is swapped with Eve's.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob's ball is swapped with Claire's.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Eve's ball is swapped with Alice's.
5. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's ball is swapped with Gertrude's.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's ball is swapped with Dave's.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude's ball is swapped with Bob's.

**The key is to see how the ball distribution changes with each swap.** 

**Final Ball Distribution:**

* **Fred:**  Fred ends up with the **(A) white ball**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can break down the gift swaps to figure out Fred's present:

* **We know:**  Fred starts with a black ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.

**The key is that the colors are mixed up.**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **We know:**  We need to figure out what Dave has at the end. 
* **The swaps:** We need to look at the swaps that happened. 
* **The key:**  We need to figure out what happened to the gifts that were swapped. 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Eve and Bob swap gifts.
2. Dave and Claire swap gifts.
3. Alice and Bob swap gifts.
4. Alice and Gertrude swap gifts.
5. Claire and Bob swap gifts.
6. Dave and Fred swap gifts.
7. Bob and Eve swap gifts.

**The answer:**  Dave has the **(F) green present.** 



"
"The answer is **(E) orange ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps and how they affect the players' balls:

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve starts with a red ball, and Gertrude starts with an orange ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This means Dave starts with a pink ball, and Fred starts with a green ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** This means Claire starts with an orange ball, and Fred starts with a green ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Eve starts with a red ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with an orange ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Eve starts with a red ball, and Gertrude starts with a brown ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with an orange ball.



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Claire starts as a right winger.  We know that Bob and Claire swap positions, so Bob becomes the left midfielder and Claire becomes the right winger.  Then, Bob and Fred swap positions, so Bob becomes the center midfielder and Fred becomes the left midfielder.  Then, Gertrude and Alice swap positions, so Gertrude becomes the right winger and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.  Then, Eve and Alice swap positions, so Eve becomes the right winger and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.  Finally, Eve and Dave swap positions, so Eve becomes the center midfielder and Dave becomes the goalkeeper. 

So, Claire is now playing right winger.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Eve ends up with Moby Dick because of the final swap.  Here's how it breaks down:

* **Eve starts with Moby Dick.**
* **The final swap is between Fred and Claire.** 
* **Fred gets Ulysses from Claire.** 
* **Fred then swaps with Gertrude.** 
* **Gertrude then swaps with Eve.** 


Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's break down the dance swaps! 

* **Start:** Alice-Melissa, Bob-Jamie, Claire-Sam, Dave-Izzi, Eve-Karl, Fred-Ophelia, Gertrude-Helga
* **Dave and Gertrude switch:**  Dave-Izzi, Gertrude-Bob
* **Gertrude and Bob switch:**  Dave-Izzi, Fred-Bob
* **Dave and Eve switch:**  Fred-Bob, Eve-Alice
* **Fred and Bob switch:**  Eve-Alice,  

**So, the final dance partner for Alice is Jamie.** 


**Answer:** (G) Jamie 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Dave ends up with the yellow present.  

The answer is **(E).** 



"
"Okay, so let's break down the trades:

1. Eve and Bob switch positions. Eve becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the left winger.
2. Gertrude and Bob switch positions. Gertrude becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the left winger.
3. Bob and Dave switch positions. Bob becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the right winger.
4. Gertrude and Dave switch positions. Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the right winger.
5. Bob and Claire switch positions. Bob becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the right winger.
6. Fred and Bob switch positions. Fred becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the left winger.
7. Alice and Eve switch positions. Alice becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the left winger.

Now, let's look at the final positions:

* Alice is now playing **left winger**.

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob her ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

**The key is to see who ends up with the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with them.**

**Final Answer:** Dave ends up with the ball that was originally held by Alice.

"Fred is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"The final dance partner for Alice is Ophelia! 

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **Start with the initial colors:**  We know Alice has yellow, Bob has white, Claire has pink, Dave has black, Eve has red, Fred has brown, and Gertrude has orange.

* **The swaps:**  We need to see how the swaps affect the colors.  

* **The key is to remember that the colors don't change.** 

Let me know if you'd like me to go through the swaps step-by-step!

2. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
3. **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob her ball.
5. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
6. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
7. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

**The final ball distribution is:**

* Eve: **(E) green ball**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the gifts are being swapped, and we need to figure out who ends up with what.  

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Start:**  We have a bunch of colors: blue, brown, orange, red, black, purple, and green. 

2. **Claire and Gertrude Swap:**  This means Claire gets a new color, and Gertrude gets a new color.

3. **Fred and Gertrude Swap:**  Fred gets a new color, and Gertrude gets a new color.

4. **Gertrude and Eve Swap:**  Gertrude gets a new color, and Eve gets a new color.

5. **Dave and Eve Swap:**  Dave gets a new color, and Eve gets a new color.

6. **Dave and Alice Swap:**  Dave gets a new color, and Alice gets a new color.

7. **Eve and Alice Swap:**  Eve gets a new color, and Alice gets a new color.

8. **Bob and Dave Swap:**  Bob gets a new color, and Dave gets a new color.

**The final color is green, and it's Bob's!**

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
6. **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**

Now, let's think about who Claire is dancing with at the end.  

**The answer is (C) Jamie.** 



"
"The answer is **(C) purple ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Dave swap, Dave gets a black ball.
2. Gertrude and Claire swap, Gertrude gets a blue ball.
3. Dave and Bob swap, Dave gets a brown ball.
4. Claire and Gertrude swap, Claire gets a yellow ball.
5. Alice and Fred swap, Alice gets a black ball.
6. Bob and Alice swap, Bob gets a pink ball.
7. Eve and Bob swap, Eve gets a purple ball. 


Let me know if you'd like to play another game!

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Alice and Bob:**  They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

**The answer is (E) Frankenstein.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **The swaps:**  We need to see how the swaps affect the books. 

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Claire's book.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Eve's book.
5. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Fred's book.
6. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Dave's book.
7. **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Fred's book.

**Fred ends up with Frankenstein.**

2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives his green ball to Bob, who gives his pink ball to Dave.
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Gertrude, who gives her yellow ball to Eve.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his pink ball to Alice, who gives her orange ball to Bob.
5. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Fred, who gives his red ball to Eve.
6. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives her brown ball to Dave, who gives his green ball to Claire.

The final ball that Fred holds is the blue ball. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Eve and Dave swap balls, then Eve and Fred swap balls, and then Eve and Dave swap balls again.  This means Eve is getting a new ball each time.  

Then, Eve and Alice swap balls.  

Finally, Bob and Alice swap balls. 

Let's look at the final positions of the balls.  Eve has the **(D) blue ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can break down the book swaps:

* **Start:**  Alice has *The Odyssey*, Bob has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and so on.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means Gertrude now has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and Bob has *The Odyssey*.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Eve now has *The Odyssey*, and Bob has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob now has *The Pearl*, and Dave has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  Fred now has *The Pearl*, and Claire has *Catch-22*.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire now has *Catch-22*, and Alice has *The Pearl*.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob now has *The Pearl*, and Dave has *Catch-22*.
* **Eve and Fred swap:**  Eve now has *Catch-22*, and Fred has *The Pearl*.

"The answer is **(D) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Gertrude and Eve:**  Gertrude gives Eve her pink ball, and Eve gives Gertrude her red ball.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his purple ball, and Bob gives Fred his black ball.
3. **Fred and Eve:** Fred gives Eve her purple ball, and Eve gives Fred her red ball.
4. **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gives Gertrude her orange ball, and Gertrude gives Alice her pink ball.
5. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gives Gertrude her blue ball.
6. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave her pink ball, and Dave gives Gertrude her brown ball.
7. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gives Bob her orange ball, and Bob gives Alice her black ball.

"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know that Alice starts with a brown present.  Let's see how the swaps affect the gifts:

* **Eve and Fred swap:**  This changes the black ball to a pink ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This changes the green present to a yellow present.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This changes the purple present to a blue present.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This changes the pink ball to a purple present.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes the yellow present to a pink present.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This changes the blue present to a brown present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes the purple present to a yellow present.

**Therefore, Alice now has the blue present.**

"The answer is **(C) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Eve and Dave swap balls.
2. Gertrude and Eve swap balls.
3. Bob and Fred swap balls.
4. Claire and Fred swap balls.
5. Alice and Claire swap balls.
6. Eve and Fred swap balls.
7. Eve and Dave swap balls.

The final ball distribution is:

* Alice: Green ball
* Bob: Brown ball
* Claire: Orange ball
* Dave: Red ball
* Eve: Blue ball
* Fred: Black ball
* Gertrude: Yellow ball 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Bob starts as the center midfielder.  We know that Dave and Gertrude switch positions, then Dave and Fred switch positions.  Then Alice and Dave switch positions.  Alice and Gertrude switch positions.  Bob and Eve switch positions.  Dave and Alice switch positions.  Finally, Claire and Dave switch positions. 

Bob ends up playing striker. 

The answer is **(D)**.

"Claire is dancing with Melissa!  

The answer is (A).

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:**  We know Alice has a green present.
* **Gertrude and Eve:**  We don't know what they swap, but we know the gifts are swapped.
* **Gertrude and Bob:**  We don't know what they swap, but we know the gifts are swapped.
* **Gertrude and Fred:**  We don't know what they swap, but we know the gifts are swapped.
* **Bob and Dave:**  We don't know what they swap, but we know the gifts are swapped.
* **Alice and Bob:**  We don't know what they swap, but we know the gifts are swapped.
* **Dave and Claire:**  We don't know what they swap, but we know the gifts are swapped.
* **Claire and Alice:**  We don't know what they swap, but we know the gifts are swapped.

**The key is to track the gifts as they are swapped.** 

Let me know if you'd like to see a more detailed explanation of how the gifts are exchanged!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred starts with a green present.  He then receives an orange present from Eve.  So Fred's present is now an orange ball. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"The answer is **(F) brown ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Fred's yellow ball.
2. Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets Fred's yellow ball, Fred gets Eve's pink ball.
3. Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets Eve's pink ball, Eve gets Dave's green ball.
4. Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Alice's blue ball.
5. Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets Fred's yellow ball, Fred gets Dave's green ball.
6. Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets Claire's purple ball, Claire gets Bob's red ball.
7. Gertrude and Alice swap: Gertrude gets Alice's blue ball, Alice gets Gertrude's brown ball. 


Gertrude ends up with the brown ball.

"Fred is playing fullback at the end of the match.  The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  This means Claire gets the orange ball and Gertrude gets the pink ball.
2. **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets the orange ball and Alice gets the pink ball.
3. **Gertrude and Claire swap:**  Gertrude gets the pink ball and Claire gets the orange ball.
4. **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice gets the orange ball and Dave gets the pink ball.
5. **Fred and Dave swap:**  Fred gets the pink ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
6. **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire gets the orange ball and Dave gets the pink ball.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets the orange ball and Eve gets the pink ball.

**Therefore, Fred ends up with the orange ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to see who ends up with which ball.  

* Eve and Dave swap, so Eve gets Dave's blue ball and Dave gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Fred swap, so Eve gets Fred's white ball and Fred gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Dave swap again, so Eve gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's purple ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's green ball and Alice gets Bob's purple ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's pink ball and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.
* Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Alice's purple ball.

Fred ends up with the white ball!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can break down the book swaps:

* **Start:**  We know everyone gets a new book to begin with.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This means Fred now has Eve's book, and Eve has Fred's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  This means Gertrude now has Alice's book, and Alice has Gertrude's book.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave now has Claire's book, and Claire has Dave's book.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice now has Bob's book, and Bob has Alice's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice now has Fred's book, and Fred has Alice's book.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve now has Dave's book, and Dave has Eve's book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve now has Alice's book, and Alice has Eve's book.

**The final swap means that Bob has the book that was swapped with Alice.** 



**Therefore, the answer is (G) Lolita.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out Fred's book:

1. **Fred starts with The Great Gatsby.**
2. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gives Alice her book, and Alice gives it to someone else.
3. **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire and Alice swap books.
4. **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave and Gertrude swap books.
5. **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob and Dave swap books.
6. **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred and Bob swap books.

**The final swap is Fred and Bob.** 

**Therefore, Fred ends up with Catch-22.**

"Eve is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The answer is **(G) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Eve swap:  Alice gets Eve's yellow ball.
2. Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets Fred's white ball.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap: Alice gets Gertrude's black ball.
4. Fred and Claire swap: Fred gets Claire's blue ball.
5. Bob and Fred swap: Bob gets Fred's white ball.
6. Gertrude and Bob swap: Gertrude gets Bob's brown ball.
7. Gertrude and Claire swap: Gertrude gets Claire's blue ball.

Eve ends up with the yellow ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Eve ends up with the orange ball because of the final swap. 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is Left Midfielder, Bob is Goalkeeper, Claire is Benchwarmer, Dave is Cheerleader, Eve is Left Winger, Fred is Center Midfielder, and Gertrude is Striker.

* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes Striker, Gertrude becomes Cheerleader.
* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Cheerleader.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes Striker, Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes Left Winger, Eve becomes Striker.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes Striker, Gertrude becomes Left Winger.
* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes Striker, Claire becomes Left Winger.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes Goalkeeper, Bob becomes Left Winger.

**So, the final position for Alice is Left Winger.** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Dave starts with Melissa.  Then, we have a few swaps:

* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Eve and Gertrude switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Eve and Dave switch partners.
* Bob and Alice switch partners.
* Bob and Fred switch partners.
* Bob and Eve switch partners.

The final dance ends with Dave with Rodrigo. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Red
    * Bob: Orange
    * Claire: Pink
    * Dave: Purple
    * Eve: Brown
    * Fred: Black
    * Gertrude: Green

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire's present becomes Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve's present becomes Gertrude's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice's present becomes Dave's, and vice versa.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Fred's present becomes Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  Bob's present becomes Fred's, and vice versa.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:**  Gertrude's present becomes Claire's, and vice versa.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave's present becomes Claire's, and vice versa.

**The final gift Alice has is the (C) red present.** 



"
"Claire is playing left winger at the end of the match. 

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring!  

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see where Eve ends up:

* **Initial Books:** Everyone starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:** The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who gets which book. 

Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:**  Alice starts with Catch-22, Bob starts with Frankenstein.
2. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude starts with The Odyssey, Claire starts with Ulysses.
3. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.
4. **Alice and Fred:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
5. **Dave and Eve:** Dave starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Eve starts with Moby Dick.
6. **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with Ulysses, Bob starts with Frankenstein.
7. **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with Moby Dick, Bob starts with Frankenstein.

**Analyzing the swaps:**

* **Eve's book:** Eve ends up with the book she received in the last swap. 

**Therefore, Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:**  Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Bob:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
2. **Alice and Dave:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
3. **Gertrude and Fred:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
6. **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
7. **Dave and Eve:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Eve switched partners, then Bob and Claire switched partners, and so on.  Let's look at the final dance partners:

* **Fred is now dancing with Ophelia.** 

So the answer is **(F)**. 



"
"Eve ends up with the brown present!  

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is Left Midfielder, Bob is Cheerleader, Claire is Right Winger, Dave is Fullback, Eve is Goalkeeper, Fred is Center Midfielder, and Gertrude is Benchwarmer.

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Fullback, Fred becomes Goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Fullback.
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Benchwarmer.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Right Winger, Bob becomes Center Midfielder.

**Final Positions:**

* **Alice:**  Goalkeeper

"Fred ends up with The Odyssey!  Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Fred starts with Lolita.**
2. **Alice and Fred swap:** Fred gives Lolita to Alice, and Alice gets it.
3. **Eve and Fred swap:** Fred gives Ulysses to Eve, and Eve gets it.
4. **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gives Hound of the Baskervilles to Bob, and Bob gets it.
5. **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gives The Pearl to Gertrude, and Gertrude gets it.
6. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gives The Great Gatsby to Claire, and Claire gets it.
7. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Hound of the Baskervilles to Bob, and Bob gets it.
8. **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gives Moby Dick to Alice, and Alice gets it.

Fred's book is the one that was given to him in the first trade.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Start:** Dave has an orange ball. Everyone else has a different color.

2. **Bob and Gertrude:**  Bob's purple + Gertrude's pink =  **Bob gets pink, Gertrude gets purple**
3. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude's pink + Dave's orange = **Dave gets pink, Gertrude gets orange**
4. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's yellow + Gertrude's pink = **Gertrude gets yellow, Eve gets pink**
5. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's purple + Dave's orange = **Dave gets purple, Bob gets orange**
6. **Claire and Dave:** Claire's white + Dave's orange = **Dave gets white, Claire gets orange**
7. **Fred and Alice:** Fred's brown + Alice's blue = **Alice gets brown, Fred gets blue**
8. **Bob and Eve:** Bob's purple + Eve's yellow = **Eve gets purple, Bob gets yellow**

**Therefore, Dave ends up with the white present.**

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which book:

* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Gertrude's book.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

**The key is to see how the books are exchanged.**  Claire's book changes hands multiple times.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up with the green present.  

The answer is **(E) green present**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob starts with a black ball.  Let's see how the swaps affect the balls:

* Eve and Claire swap, so Eve gets a pink ball and Claire gets a purple ball.
* Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets a pink ball and Eve gets a black ball.
* Claire and Alice swap, so Claire gets a white ball and Alice gets a pink ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets a white ball and Alice gets a pink ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets a purple ball and Eve gets an orange ball.
* Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred gets a green ball and Gertrude gets a brown ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets a pink ball and Claire gets a brown ball.

**Therefore, Bob has the green ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball trading! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her white ball, Dave gives Eve her pink ball.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives Eve her purple ball, Eve gives Claire her white ball.
3. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her pink ball, Claire gives Dave her purple ball.
4. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, Fred gives Bob his red ball.
5. **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his red ball, Dave gives Fred his pink ball.
6. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her white ball, Alice gives Eve her green ball.
7. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude her pink ball, Gertrude gives Dave her orange ball.

**Final Ball:** Fred has the **white ball**. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

Gertrude ends up with the black ball because she received it from Eve. 

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball trading! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
2. **Claire and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
3. **Eve and Alice:** Swap, so Eve gets a blue ball and Alice gets a white ball.
4. **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
5. **Alice and Dave:** Swap, so Alice gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
6. **Fred and Dave:** Swap, so Fred gets a pink ball and Dave gets a black ball.
7. **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so Claire gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
8. **Bob and Eve:** Swap, so Bob gets a pink ball and Eve gets a black ball.

**Therefore, Bob has the yellow ball.** 



 
"
"Eve ends up with *The Fellowship of the Ring*. 

The correct answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Start:**  Alice-Melissa, Bob-Lola, Claire-Patrick, Dave-Sam, Eve-Izzi, Fred-Helga, Gertrude-Rodrigo
2. **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred-Helga, Gertrude-Alice
3. **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire-Dave, Fred-Alice
4. **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice-Dave, Bob-Alice
5. **Gertrude and Eve switch:** Gertrude-Dave, Eve-Gertrude
6. **Dave and Gertrude switch:** Dave-Alice, Gertrude-Dave

**Final Dance:**  Alice is now dancing with **Dave**. 


The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives up her blue ball to Alice.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives up his green ball to Bob.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives up his green ball to Claire.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives up her brown ball to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Eve.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives up her orange ball to Fred.

**Fred ends up with the green ball.** 


The answer is **(E) green ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps! 

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob's ball is now Claire's, and Claire's ball is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Dave's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred's ball is now Bob's, and Bob's ball is now Fred's.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave's ball is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's ball is now Dave's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred's ball is now Bob's, and Bob's ball is now Fred's.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Gertrude's ball is now Fred's, and Fred's ball is now Gertrude's.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice's ball is now Fred's, and Fred's ball is now Alice's.

The final ball Alice has is the purple ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has what:

* **Fred and Gertrude:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Fred's.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap, so Fred gets Eve's present and Eve gets Fred's.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Claire gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Claire's.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Dave gets Eve's present and Eve gets Dave's.
* **Alice and Fred:** They swap, so Alice gets Fred's present and Fred gets Alice's.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Alice gets Bob's present and Bob gets Alice's.

**Therefore, the answer is (F) red present.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how the trading works:

* **Initial:** Everyone starts with a new book.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Bob's book.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Dave's book.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Gertrude gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Gertrude's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

**The final book distribution is:**

* Alice: **Catch-22**
* Bob: **Lolita**
* Claire: **The Pearl**
* Dave: **Frankenstein**
* Eve: **The Pearl**
* Fred: **Catch-22**
* Gertrude: **Ulysses**

"The answer is **(G) white ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Fred and Gertrude:** Swap, so they end up with each other's colors.
2. **Fred and Alice:** Swap, so Alice now has Fred's ball.
3. **Alice and Claire:** Swap, so Claire now has Alice's ball.
4. **Bob and Dave:** Swap, so Dave now has Bob's ball.
5. **Fred and Eve:** Swap, so Eve now has Fred's ball.
6. **Gertrude and Fred:** Swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's ball.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Swap, so Bob now has Gertrude's ball. 


Bob ends up with the white ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has what at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: White
    * Bob: Black
    * Claire: Pink
    * Dave: Orange
    * Eve: Purple
    * Fred: Yellow
    * Gertrude: Blue

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This changes Dave's present to something Fred has, and Fred's present to something Dave has. 
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes Bob's present to something Fred has, and Fred's present to something Bob has.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something Dave has, and Dave's present to something Gertrude has.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Claire has, and Claire's present to something Dave has.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Eve has, and Eve's present to something Dave has.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This changes Claire's present to something Bob has, and Bob's present to something Claire has.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Alice has, and Alice's present to something Dave has.

**The final gift Gertrude has is the one that was originally Fred's.** 

**The answer is (F) blue present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

* **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve starts with a blue ball, and Gertrude starts with a black ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with a black ball and Gertrude ends up with a blue ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Fred ends up with an orange ball and Bob ends up with a yellow ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred starts with an orange ball, and Claire starts with a white ball. They swap, so Fred ends up with a white ball and Claire ends up with an orange ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with a black ball, and Fred starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Eve ends up with an orange ball and Fred ends up with a black ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred starts with a white ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Fred ends up with a pink ball and Claire ends up with a white ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with a green ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Alice ends up with an orange ball and Bob ends up with a green ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave starts with a pink ball, and Gertrude starts with a black ball. They swap, so Dave ends up with a black ball and Gertrude ends up with a pink ball.

**Therefore, Fred ends up with the black ball.**

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out Fred's present:

* **Start:** We know Fred has a yellow present.
* **Bob and Eve Swap:**  This changes Bob's orange ball to Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Eve Swap:** This changes Dave's red present to Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Fred Swap:** This changes Dave's red present to Fred's yellow present.
* **Alice and Fred Swap:** This changes Alice's green present to Fred's yellow present.
* **Claire and Bob Swap:** This changes Claire's pink ball to Bob's orange ball.
* **Claire and Eve Swap:** This changes Claire's pink ball to Eve's black ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude Swap:** This changes Claire's pink ball to Gertrude's blue present.

**Fred's Present:**  Fred's present is the one that was originally Claire's. 

**Answer:** (B) pink ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **Start:** We know Dave has a blue present.
* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap, so Bob's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Fred:** They swap, so Dave's present is now Fred's, and Fred's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so Alice's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Alice's.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Alice's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Alice's.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap, so Bob's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap, so Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap, so Fred's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Fred's.

**The key is that the gifts are swapped in pairs.**  

**Dave's present is the one that was originally Fred's.** 

**Therefore, Dave has the green present (Fred's original present).** 

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"The answer is **(C) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps and how they affect the players:

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve starts with a white ball and Gertrude starts with a blue ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Bob has a purple ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob now has a purple ball, and Dave has a pink ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred now has a brown ball, and Claire has a black ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Gertrude has a white ball.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Alice now has an orange ball, and Fred has a brown ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Dave now has a pink ball, and Eve has a blue ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

* **Fred and Eve switch partners:** Fred-Ophelia, Eve-Karl
* **Bob and Dave switch partners:** Bob-Claire, Dave-Sam
* **Eve and Alice switch partners:** Eve-Karl, Alice-Sam
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** Bob-Melissa, Claire-Sam
* **Eve and Alice switch partners:** Eve-Karl, Alice-Sam
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:** Gertrude-Lola, Fred-Ophelia
* **Bob and Dave switch partners:** Bob-Melissa, Dave-Sam

The final dance partners are:

* **Alice:**  Alice is dancing with **Sam**.

"Okay, let's break down the book swap! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:**  We know everyone starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track the swaps to see how the books change hands. 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Gertrude gets The Pearl.
2. **Eve and Claire swap:** Claire gets The Great Gatsby, Eve gets Moby Dick.
3. **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets The Pearl, Gertrude gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
4. **Gertrude and Eve swap:** Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Gertrude gets Moby Dick.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:** Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Alice gets The Pearl.
6. **Bob and Dave swap:** Dave gets Catch-22, Bob gets The Pearl.

**Final Ownership:**  Dave ends up with **Hound of the Baskervilles**.

1. **Dave starts with Karl.**
2. **Alice and Fred switch partners.**
3. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Gertrude and Bob switch partners.**
6. **Claire and Bob switch partners.**
7. **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
8. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**

**The final answer is (D) Helga.**

"Eve is dancing with Sam!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Fred has a white present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This changes Gertrude's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Claire's.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes Eve's present to Claire's, and Claire's present to Eve's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Gertrude's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to Bob's, and Bob's present to Fred's.

**Fred's present at the end will be the one that was originally Bob's.** 

**The answer is (F) yellow.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Fred is with Sam, Alice is with Karl, etc.
2. **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred now dances with someone else.
3. **Eve and Gertrude switch:** Eve and Gertrude now dance with someone else.
4. **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire and Eve now dance with someone else.
5. **Fred and Dave switch:** Fred now dances with someone else.
6. **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire and Alice now dance with someone else.
7. **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred now dances with someone else.
8. **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob and Claire now dance with someone else.

**The final answer is (D) Ophelia.** 



"
"Eve is dancing with Rodrigo!  

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Bob is dancing with Melissa!  

The answer is (D). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has at the end:

* **Start:** We know Gertrude has a black ball.
* **Fred and Gertrude Swap:**  Fred's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Fred's.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:** Eve's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Eve's.
* **Eve and Alice Swap:** Eve's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob Swap:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Dave Swap:** Gertrude's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Gertrude's.

**The answer is (C) black ball.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out the final book Dave has:

* **Initial Distribution:**  Each person starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who gets which book after each swap.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

1. **Alice and Claire:**  Alice starts with Catch-22, Claire starts with Lolita.
2. **Bob and Dave:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Dave and Fred:** Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.
4. **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with The Pearl, Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.
5. **Alice and Dave:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
6. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby, Gertrude starts with Frankenstein.
7. **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The Final Swap:**  Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring. 

**Therefore, the answer is (F).**

"Okay, so let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how the books end up after all the trading:

* **Alice:**  Starts with Ulysses, then swaps with Gertrude, so she ends up with Lolita.
* **Bob:** Starts with The Odyssey, then swaps with Claire, so he ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Claire:** Starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, then swaps with Alice, then with Bob, then with Eve, then with Dave, so she ends up with The Odyssey.
* **Dave:** Starts with Moby Dick, then swaps with Fred, so he ends up with The Pearl.
* **Eve:** Starts with Frankenstein, then swaps with Claire, so she ends up with Ulysses.
* **Fred:** Starts with The Pearl, then swaps with Alice, so he ends up with Frankenstein.
* **Gertrude:** Starts with Lolita, then swaps with Alice, so she ends up with Ulysses.

**Therefore, Claire has The Odyssey.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Bob and Dave switch partners.**
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
4. **Alice and Gertrude switch partners.**
5. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
6. **Bob and Fred switch partners.**
7. **Fred and Eve switch partners.**

Now, let's see who is dancing with whom at the end. 

**The answer is (F) Helga.**

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives her ball to Alice.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives her ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives her ball to Gertrude.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his ball to Alice.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives her ball to Alice.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives his ball to Alice.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives his ball to Fred.

**The key is to see who ends up with the ball after each swap.**

* **Alice** ends up with the ball from each swap. 
* **Claire** ends up with the ball from the swap with Eve and Gertrude. 

**Therefore, Claire ends up with the ball that was originally held by Eve.** 

**Answer:** (B) blue ball. 



"
"Fred ends up with The Pearl!  

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred starts with *The Great Gatsby*.
2. Fred and Bob swap, so Fred now has Bob's book.
3. Bob and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
4. Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
5. Alice and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
6. Claire and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
7. Alice and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
8. Dave and Eve swap, so Fred now has Dave's book.

Fred's book is *The Pearl*. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as the cheerleader.  We know Bob and Alice switch positions, so Bob becomes the cheerleader and Alice becomes the right midfielder.  Then Claire and Fred switch positions, so Claire becomes the striker and Fred becomes the right winger.  

Gertrude and Fred switch positions, so Gertrude becomes the striker and Fred becomes the right midfielder.  Eve and Fred switch positions, so Eve becomes the striker and Fred becomes the fullback.  Alice and Gertrude switch positions, so Alice becomes the fullback and Gertrude becomes the striker.  Finally, Gertrude and Dave switch positions, so Gertrude becomes the center midfielder and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.  

Bob and Dave switch positions, so Bob becomes the goalkeeper and Dave becomes the center midfielder. 

**Therefore, Alice is now the fullback.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out what Dave has, we need to know what gifts were swapped.  

Here's how we can break it down:

* **Fred and Eve Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Gertrude and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Alice and Bob Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Alice and Dave Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Fred and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Eve and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Fred and Claire Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

**The problem is that we don't know what gifts were swapped, so we can't determine the final gift Dave has.**

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Start:**  Each person has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who ends up with which ball.

Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Claire and Dave:**  Claire's ball is swapped with Dave's.
2. **Fred and Eve:** Fred's ball is swapped with Eve's.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob's ball is swapped with Claire's.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Eve's ball is swapped with Alice's.
5. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's ball is swapped with Gertrude's.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's ball is swapped with Dave's.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude's ball is swapped with Bob's.

**The final ball is Gertrude's, and it is pink.**

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Blue
    * Claire: Orange
    * Dave: Yellow
    * Eve: White
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Red

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This changes Eve's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Eve's. 
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes Bob's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Bob's.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Alice's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Alice's.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This changes Claire's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Claire's.

**The answer is (E) pink ball.**

"Okay, so let's think about this!  

We know that the gifts are being swapped, and we need to figure out who ends up with what.  

The key is to remember that the gifts are being swapped in a way that doesn't change the color of the gifts. 

**Therefore, Gertrude will have the brown present at the end.**

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Bob is right winger, Claire is fullback, Dave is striker, Eve is benchwarmer, Fred is right midfielder, and Gertrude is left winger. 

2. **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes left winger, Gertrude becomes cheerleader.

3. **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes left winger, Claire becomes fullback.

4. **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes fullback, Fred becomes right winger.

5. **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes left winger, Alice becomes right winger.

6. **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes right winger, Fred becomes left winger.

7. **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes right winger, Bob becomes fullback.

8. **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire becomes benchwarmer, Eve becomes right winger.

**Final Position:** Bob is now playing **(B) Fullback**.

"Eve ends up with the green ball!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Gertrude starts as the benchwarmer, and we know she's going to be playing a different position by the end of the game.  Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Fullback, Fred becomes Goalkeeper
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Fullback
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Benchwarmer
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Goalkeeper
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Right Winger, Bob becomes Center Midfielder

**Final Positions:**

* **Gertrude:** Left Midfielder
* **Alice:** Goalkeeper
* **Bob:** Center Midfielder
* **Claire:** Right Winger
* **Dave:** Fullback
* **Eve:** Center Midfielder
* **Fred:** Right Winger 


**Answer:** (A) Left Midfielder 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Fred's present is the **black ball**.  Here's why:

* **Fred and Bob Swap:** Fred's present doesn't change.
* **Dave and Claire Swap:** Fred's present doesn't change.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has which book at the end, we need to follow the order of the swaps.  

* **Alice and Bob:**  Alice starts with Moby Dick, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave starts with The Pearl, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Moby Dick, Eve starts with Ulysses.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Catch-22, Dave starts with The Pearl.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Pearl.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.

**The answer is (B) The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Start:** Everyone has a ball.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a brown ball, Gertrude gets a white ball.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets a yellow ball, Claire gets a pink ball.
4. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gets a yellow ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
5. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a pink ball, Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets a pink ball, Claire gets a green ball.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets a green ball, Claire gets a brown ball.
8. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets a brown ball, Claire gets an orange ball.

**So, who has the white ball?**

* (B) white ball 


Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they both have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve and Alice have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice and Fred have a book they didn't originally get.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at the end of the semester.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (E) Ulysses.** 



"
"Fred ends up with Catch-22.  

The correct answer is **(E)**. 
"
"The answer is **(F) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

* **Alice and Fred:**  Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Bob's white ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

Bob ends up with the yellow ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

* **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners.**
* **Claire and Gertrude switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Bob switch partners.**
* **Claire and Bob switch partners.**
* **Fred and Gertrude switch partners.**
* **Claire and Dave switch partners.**

The final dance is a bit tricky, but we can figure it out! 

**Answer: (F) Karl** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Claire is with Melissa.
2. **Fred and Eve switch:** Fred now dances with Ophelia, Eve now dances with Karl.
3. **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob now dances with Claire, Dave now dances with Ophelia.
4. **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve now dances with Karl, Alice now dances with Dave.
5. **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob now dances with Ophelia, Claire now dances with Karl.
6. **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve now dances with Karl, Alice now dances with Dave.
7. **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude now dances with Ophelia, Fred now dances with Karl.
8. **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob now dances with Ophelia, Dave now dances with Karl.

**Therefore, Claire is dancing with Karl.** 


The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Bob is dancing with Lola!  The final swap is Bob and Eve switching partners. 

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Fred and Gertrude switch partners first, so Fred is now dancing with Lola.  Then Dave and Claire switch partners, so Dave is now dancing with Sam.  

The next swap is Dave and Bob, so Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.  Bob and Claire switch partners, so Bob is now dancing with Ophelia.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners, so Alice is now dancing with Rodrigo.  Dave and Alice switch partners, so Dave is now dancing with Jamie.  Finally, Eve and Gertrude switch partners, so Eve is now dancing with Karl. 


So the answer is **(F) Karl**. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out what book Gertrude has at the end:

* **Initial Ownership:**  We know each person starts with a specific book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track how the books are exchanged. 
* **The Goal:**  We want to know what book Gertrude has at the end.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Alice and Eve:**  Alice starts with Lolita, Eve starts with Catch-22.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.
3. **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
4. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
5. **Alice and Fred:** Alice starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
6. **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with Catch-22, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.

**The key is to understand that the swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

**Therefore, the answer is (F) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has what, we need to know what gifts were swapped.  

Here's how we can think about it:

* **Fred and Eve:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.
* **Claire and Dave:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.
* **Gertrude and Alice:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.
* **Gertrude and Bob:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.
* **Dave and Fred:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.
* **Dave and Gertrude:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.
* **Bob and Eve:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.

**So, we can't determine who has what!** 



 
"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track who gets which book after each swap.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

1. **Alice and Eve:** Alice gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Alice's book.
2. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Dave's book.
3. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Gertrude's book.
4. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Alice's book.
5. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
6. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.

**The key is to remember that each swap involves two people exchanging books.**

**Therefore, the final book Gertrude has is (E) The Odyssey.** 



"
"The answer is **(C) brown ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Bob swap, then Eve and Fred swap, then Dave and Eve swap.  
2. Alice and Bob swap, then Dave and Fred swap.
3. Bob and Claire swap.
4. Gertrude and Alice swap.

The final ball in Alice's possession is the brown ball. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know Dave starts as the goalkeeper.  Then, Bob and Fred swap positions, and Bob then swaps with Dave.  This means Dave moves to the left winger position.  Then, Gertrude and Eve swap positions, and then Bob and Dave swap positions again.  This means Dave is now playing left winger.  Finally, Gertrude and Dave swap positions, and Eve and Alice swap positions.  

So, Dave is now playing **(C) center midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has what, we need to think about how the gifts are swapped.  

Here's the breakdown:

* **We know:**  The gifts are swapped in pairs. 
* **We need to figure out:**  Who ends up with what after all the swaps.

Let me know if you want to try another puzzle!

"Gertrude is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

The answer is (E). 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the trades! 

* **Start:** Dave is right midfielder, Gertrude is fullback, Fred is left winger, Alice is left midfielder, Bob is cheerleader, Claire is right winger, and Eve is striker.

* **Fred and Gertrude trade:** Fred becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes left winger.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes right midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes left winger, Fred becomes fullback.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes cheerleader, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes right midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes right winger, Claire becomes striker.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes right winger, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.

**Final Positions:**

* **Dave:** He started as right midfielder and then traded with Gertrude, so he ends up as right winger. 

**Answer:** (G)

"Okay, let's break down the dance changes! 

Here's the key:  We need to figure out who Bob is dancing with at the end. 

* **Start:** Bob - Karl, Claire - Izzi, Dave - Jamie, Eve - Helga, Fred - Rodrigo, Gertrude - Ophelia
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire - Izzi, Eve - Helga
* **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice - Rodrigo, Fred - Gertrude
* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude - Ophelia, Dave - Jamie
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve - Karl, Bob - Helga
* **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve - Rodrigo, Fred - Ophelia
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob - Izzi, Claire - Helga

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Izzi.**

"The answer is **(D) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap again, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap again, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.

Gertrude ends up with the ball that was originally Claire's ball.

"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Bob starts as the goalkeeper.  We know that Gertrude and Eve switch positions, then Gertrude and Alice switch positions.  Then Eve and Claire switch positions.  Fred and Eve switch positions.  Claire and Gertrude switch positions.  Claire and Dave switch positions.  Finally, Fred and Bob switch positions. 

Bob ends up playing goalkeeper. 

The answer is **(A)**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We have a bunch of colors and a bunch of people. 
* **Swapping:**  We're going to swap gifts, which means we're going to change the colors. 
* **The Goal:** We want to figure out what Gertrude has at the end.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Fred swap.
2. Claire and Bob swap.
3. Dave and Fred swap.
4. Eve and Alice swap.
5. Bob and Alice swap.
6. Eve and Gertrude swap.
7. Fred and Alice swap.

**The key is to remember that the colors are being swapped, not the gifts themselves.** 

Let me know if you'd like to try another gift exchange puzzle!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Start:** Fred is with Sam.
2. **Claire and Fred switch:** Fred is now with someone else.
3. **Claire and Dave switch:** Dave is now Fred's partner.
4. **Alice and Bob switch:** Bob is now Alice's partner.
5. **Claire and Eve switch:** Eve is now Claire's partner.
6. **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave is now Claire's partner.
7. **Gertrude and Eve switch:** Eve is now Gertrude's partner.
8. **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob is now Eve's partner.

**Therefore, Fred is dancing with Sam.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swapping! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Alice:**  Alice starts with Ulysses.  She then trades with Dave, so she ends up with The Pearl. 
* **Bob:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby. He trades with Claire, so he ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Claire:** Claire starts with The Fellowship of the Ring. She trades with Dave, so she ends up with The Pearl.
* **Dave:** Dave starts with The Pearl. He trades with Bob, so he ends up with The Great Gatsby.
* **Eve:** Eve starts with Hound of the Baskervilles. She trades with Fred, so she ends up with Lolita.
* **Fred:** Fred starts with Lolita. He trades with Eve, so he ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude starts with Catch-22. She trades with Fred, so she ends up with Lolita.

**Therefore, the answer is (D) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book to begin with. 
* **Look for patterns:**  We need to see which books are traded and who trades with whom. 
* **The key is to track the books that Dave trades with:**  This will help us figure out which book Dave ends up with.

"The answer is **(C) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Gertrude swap.
2. Gertrude and Bob swap.
3. Fred and Claire swap.
4. Claire and Dave swap.
5. Claire and Eve swap.
6. Alice and Bob swap.
7. Claire and Eve swap.

Notice that the ball that was originally Claire's ball is the one that ends up with Dave.

"Eve is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Dave and Alice:** Dave starts with a green ball, Alice starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Alice gets the green ball.
2. **Alice and Fred:** Alice now has the pink ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the pink ball and Alice gets the black ball.
3. **Fred and Dave:** Fred now has the pink ball, Dave has the black ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Fred gets the black ball.
4. **Eve and Bob:** Eve now has the blue ball, Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Eve gets the orange ball.
5. **Claire and Fred:** Claire now has the white ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the white ball and Claire gets the black ball.
6. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob now has the orange ball, Gertrude has the yellow ball. They swap, so Gertrude gets the orange ball and Bob gets the yellow ball.
7. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude now has the yellow ball, Alice has the black ball. They swap, so Alice gets the yellow ball and Gertrude gets the black ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the white ball.**

* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap, so Gertrude starts with Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve and Bob swap, so Eve now has Bob's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap, so Dave now has Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred and Claire swap, so Claire now has Fred's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** Claire and Alice swap, so Alice now has Claire's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap again, so Bob now has Dave's book.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve and Fred swap, so Fred now has Eve's book.

**Therefore, the answer is (B) Catch-22.**

"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Dave ends up with the green present.  

The answer is **(F) green present.** 
"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out Fred's book:

* **Initial Distribution:**  Everyone starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who gets which book. 
* **Focus on Fred:**  We're only interested in Fred's book at the end.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

1. **Alice-Gertrude:** Alice gives up Ulysses, Gertrude gets it.
2. **Dave-Fred:** Dave gives up Moby Dick, Fred gets it.
3. **Alice-Claire:** Alice gives up Ulysses, Claire gets it.
4. **Claire-Bob:** Claire gives up Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob gets it.
5. **Eve-Claire:** Eve gives up Frankenstein, Claire gets it.
6. **Fred-Alice:** Fred gives up The Pearl, Alice gets it.
7. **Claire-Dave:** Claire gives up Moby Dick, Dave gets it.

**Final Book:**  Fred ends up with **Moby Dick** (from Dave). 

**Answer:** (D)

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Fred and Alice:**  Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Eve starts with Frankenstein.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Moby Dick, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

**The answer is (E) The Odyssey.**

"Okay, let's break down the dance swaps! 

* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means they now dance with different people.
* **Dave and Claire switch partners:**  This changes their partners.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Claire and Fred switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Fred and Alice switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** This changes their partners.

The final dance is a bit tricky, but we can figure it out! Fred is now dancing with the person who was originally dancing with Alice. 

**Therefore, Fred is dancing with Melissa.** 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can break down the book swapping:

* **Start:** We know everyone gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track the swaps to see who ends up with what. 

Let's go through the swaps one by one.  

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's book to Gertrude's and vice versa.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This changes Claire's book to Alice's and vice versa.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's book to Bob's and vice versa.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's book to Claire's and vice versa.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes Eve's book to Bob's and vice versa.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's book to Claire's and vice versa.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's book to Eve's and vice versa.

**The Answer:**  

To figure out who has which book at the end, we need to consider the swaps and how they affect the ownership.

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Initial Distribution:**  Each person starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who gets which book.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

1. **Claire and Gertrude:** Swap books.
2. **Fred and Dave:** Swap books.
3. **Bob and Alice:** Swap books.
4. **Eve and Gertrude:** Swap books.
5. **Dave and Bob:** Swap books.
6. **Fred and Eve:** Swap books.
7. **Bob and Fred:** Swap books.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at the end.**

**Here's a possible solution:**

* **Eve:**  Eve starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring*.  She then swaps with Gertrude, and then with Fred. 
* **Fred:** Fred starts with *Catch-22*. He then swaps with Eve, and then with Bob. 
* **Bob:** Bob starts with *Ulysses*. He then swaps with Alice, and then with Dave. 
* **Dave:** Dave starts with *The Odyssey*. He then swaps with Bob. 
* **Alice:** Alice starts with *Frankenstein*. She then swaps with Bob. 
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude starts with *Moby Dick*. She then swaps with Eve. 
* **Claire:** Claire starts with *The Great Gatsby*. She then swaps with Gertrude. 


**Therefore, Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring at the end of the semester.**

**Answer: (B)**

"The answer is **(A) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Dave and Bob swap, Dave gets a purple ball, Bob gets an orange ball.
2. Alice and Gertrude swap, Alice gets a blue ball, Gertrude gets a white ball.
3. Gertrude and Eve swap, Gertrude gets a black ball, Eve gets a white ball.
4. Claire and Eve swap, Claire gets a black ball, Eve gets a white ball.
5. Eve and Fred swap, Eve gets a pink ball, Fred gets a black ball.
6. Eve and Claire swap, Eve gets a pink ball, Claire gets a black ball.
7. Dave and Fred swap, Dave gets a pink ball, Fred gets a black ball.

Fred ends up with the black ball.

"The answer is **(D) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Alice swap: Fred gets Alice's blue ball, Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
2. Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets Gertrude's green ball, Gertrude gets Claire's brown ball.
3. Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's purple ball, Dave gets Bob's red ball.
4. Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Alice's blue ball, Alice gets Eve's black ball.
5. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.
6. Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets Eve's black ball, Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
7. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.

Fred ends up with the green ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Dave and Eve switch partners.**
2. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Fred switch partners.**
4. **Alice and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
6. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**

Now, let's see who is dancing with whom at the end.  

* **Alice is dancing with Bob.** 


**Answer:** (B) 
"
"The answer is **(B) pink ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Bob and Eve:**  Bob gets a pink ball, Eve gets a brown ball.
2. **Dave and Alice:** Alice gets a brown ball, Dave gets a pink ball.
3. **Gertrude and Claire:** Claire gets a brown ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
4. **Fred and Eve:** Eve gets a green ball, Fred gets a pink ball.
5. **Gertrude and Bob:** Bob gets a green ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
6. **Eve and Claire:** Claire gets a green ball, Eve gets a pink ball.
7. **Bob and Fred:** Fred gets a green ball, Bob gets a pink ball.

Eve ends up with the pink ball. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Claire starts as a benchwarmer, then Eve and Claire swap positions.  Then, Claire and Dave swap positions.  Dave and Bob swap positions, and then Fred and Gertrude swap positions.  Bob and Claire swap positions again.  Dave and Alice swap positions, and finally, Claire and Eve swap positions. 

So, Claire ends up playing **(G) left midfielder**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which ball:

* **Start:**  We know everyone has a ball.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets Fred's ball, Fred gets Eve's ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets Claire's ball, Claire gets Dave's ball.

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Fred starts with Frankenstein.  Then, Fred and Dave swap books.  This means Fred now has Dave's book.  

Alice and Claire swap books, so Alice now has Claire's book.

Eve and Dave swap books, so Eve now has Dave's book.

Bob and Eve swap books, so Bob now has Eve's book.

Gertrude and Claire swap books, so Gertrude now has Claire's book.

Eve and Gertrude swap books, so Eve now has Gertrude's book.

Dave and Bob swap books, so Dave now has Bob's book.

**Therefore, Fred's book at the end of the semester is Frankenstein.** 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Claire is the striker, Dave is the left midfielder, Eve is the center midfielder, Fred is the right midfielder, and Gertrude is the goalkeeper. Alice is the left winger.

2. **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the left winger.

3. **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Gertrude becomes the left midfielder.

4. **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the left winger.

5. **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes the cheerleader, and Bob becomes the right midfielder.

6. **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes the right midfielder, and Gertrude becomes the striker.

7. **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the right midfielder.

8. **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the center midfielder.

**Therefore, Claire is now the center midfielder.** 


The answer is **(F)**.

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out where Alice ends up:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap books.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Eve:** Swap books.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Swap books.

**The key is to track the books as they are traded.**  

Let's analyze the swaps to see where Alice ends up:

* **Alice's book:** Alice starts with ""The Pearl"".
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob now has ""The Pearl"" and Alice has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has ""The Pearl"" and Bob has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Fred and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Fred has ""The Pearl"".
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Claire now has ""The Pearl"" and Fred has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Dave has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Bob has ""The Pearl"".
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Gertrude has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".

**Therefore, Alice ends up with ""The Great Gatsby"".**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Dave starts with Patrick, then Eve and Dave switch partners.  Then Fred and Eve switch partners.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Dave and Bob switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners again.  Bob and Claire switch partners.  

So, Dave is now dancing with **Bob**. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

Gertrude starts with a pink ball.  She then swaps with Alice, who has a white present.  

The next swap is between Eve and Claire.  Then, Dave and Bob swap.  

We need to keep track of who has what!  

Let me know if you want to continue! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial distribution:**  We know everyone gets a new book to begin with. 
* **Then, we see the swaps:**  We need to track who swaps with whom. 
* **The key is to keep track of the books:**  We need to see how the ownership of each book changes. 

Let's go through the swaps and see where Eve ends up! 


**Eve's Book:**

Eve ends up with **(E) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Dave is starting with Sam.  We know Fred and Eve switch partners, then Bob and Dave switch partners.  Then Eve and Alice switch partners.  Then Bob and Claire switch partners.  Then Eve and Alice switch partners again.  Then Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Dave switch partners again. 

So, Dave is now with Sam. 


The answer is (A). 
"
"Gertrude is dancing with Jamie! 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Start:** Bob has a black ball, Alice has a white present, etc.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets a white present, Alice gets a black ball.
3. **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets a green present, Fred gets a blue present.
4. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets a purple present, Gertrude gets a white present.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets an orange ball, Eve gets a white present.
6. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets a brown present, Claire gets a black ball.
7. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets a blue present, Bob gets a green present.
8. **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets an orange ball, Eve gets a green present.

**Bob's final gift is the blue present.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the book Alice had at the start:

* **Initial Ownership:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Claire: The Great Gatsby
    * Dave: Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Eve: Frankenstein
    * Fred: Moby Dick
    * Gertrude: Ulysses

* **Swaps:**
    * Eve and Fred swap:  Eve gets Fred's book, Fred gets Eve's book.
    * Claire and Bob swap:  Claire gets Bob's book, Bob gets Claire's book.
    * Fred and Eve swap:  Fred gets Eve's book, Eve gets Fred's book.
    * Gertrude and Alice swap:  Gertrude gets Alice's book, Alice gets Gertrude's book.
    * Fred and Dave swap:  Fred gets Dave's book, Dave gets Fred's book.
    * Gertrude and Eve swap:  Gertrude gets Eve's book, Eve gets Gertrude's book.
    * Dave and Fred swap:  Dave gets Fred's book, Fred gets Dave's book.

* **Final Ownership:**  We need to figure out who has the book Alice had at the start. 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Fred starts as the goalkeeper.  We know that Fred and Eve trade positions, and then Eve and Claire trade positions.  Then Fred and Bob trade positions.  Then Gertrude and Fred trade positions.  Then Alice and Eve trade positions.  Then Eve and Dave trade positions.  Finally, Bob and Alice trade positions. 

Fred ends up as the right winger. 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as Left Midfielder**
* **Fred and Gertrude trade positions**
* **Dave and Gertrude trade positions**
* **Gertrude and Fred trade positions**
* **Alice and Bob trade positions**
* **Claire and Dave trade positions**
* **Eve and Claire trade positions**
* **Alice and Gertrude trade positions**

Let's look at the final positions:

* **Alice is now playing Fullback.** 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:**  We know everyone gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This means Fred now has Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  This means Gertrude now has Alice's book.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave now has Claire's book.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice now has Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice now has Fred's book.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve now has Dave's book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve now has Alice's book.

**Therefore, Fred has Catch-22.** 



 
"
"The answer is **(A) white present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets red, Eve gets white.
2. Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets orange, Gertrude gets pink.
3. Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets black, Dave gets orange.
4. Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets brown, Fred gets red.
5. Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets pink, Bob gets white.
6. Claire and Alice swap: Claire gets brown, Alice gets pink.
7. Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets pink, Bob gets white.

Bob starts with a white present, and the final swap leaves him with the white present. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Purple
    * Bob: Brown
    * Claire: Red
    * Dave: Green
    * Eve: Black
    * Fred: Yellow
    * Gertrude: White

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This changes Eve's present to something Dave had.
* **Fred and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Fred had.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's present to something Claire had.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something Dave had.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's present to something Bob had.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to something Fred had.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes Bob's present to something Alice had.

**The final answer is (E) brown present.**

"The final book Gertrude ends up with is **Hound of the Baskervilles**.  

The correct answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can break down the gift swaps to figure out who has what:

* **Initial State:**
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Brown
    * Claire: Red
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: White
    * Fred: Orange
    * Gertrude: Black

* **Alice and Dave Swap:**  Alice's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Alice's. 
* **Claire and Dave Swap:**  Claire's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Gertrude Swap:** Fred's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Fred's.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:** Eve's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Eve's.
* **Eve and Alice Swap:** Eve's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob Swap:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Dave Swap:** Gertrude's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Gertrude's.

**The final result is that Gertrude has the black ball.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball game! 

Here's how the swapping works:

1. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve his ball.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Claire her ball.
3. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Dave his ball.
4. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Bob his ball.
5. **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his ball, and Dave gives Fred his ball.
6. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
7. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Dave his ball.

**The final distribution of the balls is a cycle.**  

**Therefore, the answer is (E) red ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the gifts are swapped in pairs.  Let's see how the gifts change hands:

* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets purple, Eve gets green.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets pink, Dave gets orange.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets white, Alice gets pink.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets black, Claire gets orange.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets green, Eve gets purple.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gets brown, Claire gets black.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred gets brown, Gertrude gets green.

Now, Claire has the brown present! 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the positions! 

* **Start:** Claire is right winger, Dave is striker, Eve is center midfielder, Fred is fullback, Gertrude is benchwarmer, Alice is left midfielder, and Bob is cheerleader.

* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes left midfielder, Alice becomes benchwarmer.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes left midfielder, Gertrude becomes striker.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes striker, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes fullback, Claire becomes center midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes fullback, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes center midfielder.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes left midfielder, Alice becomes fullback.

**Final Position:** Claire is now playing **center midfielder**. 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has what present, we need to know what gifts were swapped.  

Here's how we can think about it:

* **We know:**  The gifts were swapped in pairs. 
* **We need to figure out:**  What gifts were swapped and who received them.

Let me know if you want to try another scenario! 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
6. **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**

Now, let's look at the final dance.  Eve is dancing with...

**(A) Ophelia** 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Start:** Alice has blue, Bob has red, Claire has orange, Dave has brown, Eve has black, Fred has yellow, and Gertrude has purple.

2. **Fred and Gertrude swap:** Fred gets purple, and Gertrude gets yellow.

3. **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets black, and Eve gets yellow.

4. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets orange, and Claire gets brown.

5. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets purple, and Gertrude gets orange.

6. **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets black, and Eve gets brown.

7. **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets yellow, and Fred gets blue.

8. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets red, and Bob gets blue.

**The final gift is blue!**

**Answer: (G)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire and Dave swap balls, so Claire gets Dave's purple ball and Dave gets Claire's brown ball.  Then Fred and Eve swap, so Fred gets Eve's white ball and Eve gets Fred's red ball.  

Bob and Claire swap, so Bob gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Bob's brown ball.  Then Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's white ball.  Finally, Eve and Gertrude swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's pink ball and Gertrude gets Eve's white ball.  

The final ball distribution is:

* **Claire:**  The only ball she didn't swap is her brown ball. 


**Answer:** (G) brown ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Claire switched partners, then Fred and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Eve and Bob switched partners.  Eve and Alice switched partners.  Dave and Bob switched partners.  Dave and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Alice and Dave switched partners. 

So, the final dance partners are:

* Eve is dancing with Bob.
* Dave is dancing with Alice. 
* Fred is dancing with Sam.
* Gertrude is dancing with Lola.

"Okay, let's break down the dance swaps! 

Here's the key: we need to figure out who Fred is dancing with at the end. 

* **Start:** Fred is with Lola.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave now dances with Lola, Bob now dances with Izzi.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire now dances with Rodrigo, Bob now dances with Izzi.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve now dances with Rodrigo, Bob now dances with Izzi.
* **Gertrude and Bob switch:** Gertrude now dances with Izzi, Bob now dances with Izzi.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire now dances with Rodrigo, Dave now dances with Izzi.
* **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice now dances with Izzi, Gertrude now dances with Rodrigo.
* **Bob and Fred switch:** Bob now dances with Izzi, Fred now dances with Rodrigo.

**Therefore, Fred is dancing with Rodrigo.** 

The answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has:

* **Start:** We know Gertrude has a purple present.
* **Claire and Bob Swap:**  This doesn't change anything, as they swap colors.
* **Fred and Bob Swap:** Fred's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Fred's.
* **Dave and Claire Swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Claire Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Alice and Dave Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Eve Swap:** This changes the colors.

**The answer is (E) purple present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

* **Bob and Claire switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Fred and Alice switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Dave switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Alice and Eve switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Alice and Dave switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:**  This means they swap places.

Now, we need to figure out who Claire is dancing with at the end.  

**The answer is (B) Jamie.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has what, we need to think about how each swap affects the gifts.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial State:**
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Yellow
    * Claire: White
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Purple
    * Fred: Red
    * Gertrude: Orange

* **We need to figure out the final state of the gifts after all the swaps.** 

Let me know if you'd like to try a different scenario! 



"
"Okay, let's break down the book trades! 

Here's how we can figure out what book Gertrude has at the end:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her book, and Eve gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Bob's book.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Dave's book.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Gertrude gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Gertrude's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

**The key is to see who has the book at the end.** 

Gertrude started with ""The Pearl"" and traded it to Eve. 



**Therefore, the answer is (F) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire starts with Patrick.  Then, Fred and Alice switch partners.  Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Claire and Eve switch partners.  Fred and Dave switch partners.  Claire and Alice switch partners.  Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. 

So, Claire is now dancing with Bob. 

The answer is **(B) Patrick.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has the brown present at the end, we need to see how the gifts are swapped.  

Here's what we know:

* **Initial State:** Alice: White, Bob: Orange, Claire: Black, Dave: Pink, Eve: Purple, Fred: Green, Gertrude: Brown

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.

**The key is to understand that the gifts are being swapped, not necessarily changing colors or types.** 

**The problem is missing information.** 

Let me know if you want to explore a different scenario with more information!

2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Fred his ball.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Fred his ball.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve her ball.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Alice her ball.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.
7. **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Claire his ball.

**The final ball distribution is:**

* **Gertrude:**  The ball she has is the one she started with. 
* **Alice:** The ball she has is the one she started with. 
* **Bob:** The ball he has is the one he started with. 
* **Claire:** The ball she has is the one she started with.

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means they both started with different books.

**Conclusion:**

The swaps are happening in a way that keeps the books changing hands.  We can't determine the final book Gertrude has based on the information given.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:** Alice has a white present.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This changes Fred's present to purple and Eve's present to green.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes Bob's present to pink and Dave's present to orange.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to white and Alice's present to pink.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes Bob's present to black and Claire's present to orange.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes Fred's present to green and Eve's present to purple.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes Dave's present to brown and Claire's present to black.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This changes Fred's present to brown and Gertrude's present to green.

**Final Gift:**  The only gift that remains unchanged is Alice's. 

**Answer:** (F) orange ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **Initial Books:**
    * Alice: The Odyssey
    * Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Claire: Moby Dick
    * Dave: The Pearl
    * Eve: The Great Gatsby
    * Fred: Catch-22
    * Gertrude: Hound of the Baskervilles

* **Swaps:**
    * Gertrude and Dave swap:  Gertrude gets Dave's book, Dave gets Gertrude's book.
    * Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets Claire's book, Claire gets Eve's book.
    * Dave and Gertrude swap: Dave gets Gertrude's book, Gertrude gets Dave's book.
    * Gertrude and Eve swap: Gertrude gets Eve's book, Eve gets Gertrude's book.
    * Alice and Eve swap: Alice gets Eve's book, Eve gets Alice's book.
    * Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's book, Dave gets Bob's book.
    * Alice and Fred swap: Alice gets Fred's book, Fred gets Alice's book.

* **Final Book:**  To figure out who has which book, we need to track the books that were swapped.  

Let me know if you'd like to continue working through the swaps!

    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: White
    * Fred: Orange
    * Gertrude: Black

* **Alice and Dave Swap:**  Alice's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Alice's. 
* **Claire and Dave Swap:**  Claire's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Gertrude Swap:** Fred's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Fred's.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:** Eve's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Eve's.

"Gertrude ends up playing fullback!  She and Bob switched positions in the last trade.  

The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is Center Midfielder, Bob is Striker, Claire is Left Winger, Dave is Cheerleader, Eve is Fullback, Fred is Right Winger, and Gertrude is Benchwarmer.

2. **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes Left Winger, Claire becomes Center Midfielder.

3. **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes Striker, Bob becomes Fullback.

4. **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Alice becomes Fullback.

5. **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire becomes Right Winger, Fred becomes Center Midfielder.

6. **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes Cheerleader, Dave becomes Fullback.

7. **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Fred becomes Center Midfielder.

8. **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Striker, Bob becomes Right Winger.

**Final Positions:**

* Alice: Fullback
* Bob: Striker
* Claire: Right Winger
* Dave: Cheerleader
* Eve: Center Midfielder
* Fred: Striker
* Gertrude: Benchwarmer


**Answer:** (F) right winger

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **We know they all start with a new book.**  
* **The swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Fred and Dave swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
2. **Eve and Fred swap:**  This means Eve had a book Fred traded.
3. **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
5. **Eve and Bob swap:**  This means Eve had a book Bob traded.
6. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
7. **Fred and Claire swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.

**The swaps are happening in a circular fashion, so we can deduce that the final book ownership is:**

* **Gertrude:**  Ulysses
* **Bob:**  The Great Gatsby
* **Dave:**  The Odyssey
* **Alice:**  Moby Dick

"Fred is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is (E). 
"
"The answer is **(A) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see how the balls are distributed:

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  Gertrude gives Bob her ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave takes Bob's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave takes Fred's ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude takes Dave's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve takes Alice's ball.

Dave ends up with the ball he swapped with Fred. Bob ends up with the ball he swapped with Gertrude. Claire ends up with the ball she swapped with Bob. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
6. **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**

Now, let's look at the final dance.  

**The final dance partner for Alice is:**

**(A) Jamie** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Fred and Eve:** Swap balls.
2. **Claire and Bob:** Swap balls.
3. **Fred and Bob:** Swap balls.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Swap balls.
5. **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap balls.
6. **Bob and Claire:** Swap balls.
7. **Dave and Eve:** Swap balls.

Notice that the swapping pattern is a bit tricky, but it's important to keep track of who has which ball.  

**The final ball that Claire has is the yellow ball.** 

**Answer: (D) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up with the brown present.  

The answer is **(A) brown present.** 
"
"Okay, let's break down the dance swaps! 

Here's the key:  We need to figure out who Bob is dancing with at the end. 

* **Start:** Bob - Patrick, Claire - Karl, Dave - Rodrigo, Eve - Izzi, Fred - Helga, Gertrude - Jamie
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire - Karl, Eve - Izzi
* **Gertrude and Alice switch:** Gertrude - Jamie, Alice - Ophelia
* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob - Ophelia, Alice - Karl
* **Eve and Gertrude switch:** Eve - Izzi, Gertrude - Jamie

* **Start:**  We know the initial colors of each person's present.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Eve's present.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means Bob now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Bob's present.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:**  This means Fred now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Fred's present.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has Bob's present, and Bob now has Dave's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Bob now has Alice's present, and Alice now has Bob's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Claire now has Dave's present, and Dave now has Claire's present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Alice now has Claire's present, and Claire now has Alice's present.

"Let's break down the book swapping! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the book that was originally owned by Gertrude:

* **Initial Distribution:**  We start with each person having a new book. 
* **Swaps:**  We see a series of swaps happening throughout the semester.  

**The key is to track the books as they are swapped.**  

Let me know if you'd like me to walk through each swap and see who ends up with which book!

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's the key:  We need to figure out who ends up with each book.  

* **Gertrude and Bob:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Eve and Fred:** This swap doesn't change Dave's book.

**Therefore, Dave ends up with The Pearl.**

"Okay, let's break down the ball trades! 

Here's how the game goes:

* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gives Fred her blue ball, and Fred gets Alice's blue ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, and Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, and Bob gets Claire's black ball.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gives Alice her blue ball, and Alice gets Dave's blue ball.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob gives Fred his orange ball, and Fred gets Bob's orange ball.

**The final ball:**  Dave is the only one who has a ball that hasn't been traded. 

**Therefore, the answer is (A) brown ball.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:** The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave started with a different book than Gertrude.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave started with a different book than Claire.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob started with different books.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire started with different books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This means Alice and Gertrude started with different books.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob and Alice started with different books.

**The key is to keep track of who started with which book.** 

**Here's a possible solution:**

1. **Gertrude:** Frankenstein
2. **Fred:** The Pearl
3. **Dave:** The Odyssey
4. **Claire:** The Great Gatsby
5. **Alice:** Hound of the Baskervilles
6. **Bob:** Lolita
7. **Eve:** Ulysses

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

* **Dave and Bob switch partners:** Dave now dances with Ophelia.
* **Eve and Claire switch partners:** Eve and Claire now dance with each other.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch partners:** Claire and Gertrude now dance with each other.
* **Alice and Eve switch partners:** Alice and Eve now dance with each other.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** Gertrude and Alice now dance with each other.
* **Eve and Fred switch partners:** Eve and Fred now dance with each other.
* **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:** Gertrude and Claire now dance with each other.

**Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.** 


The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gives Eve her orange ball.
2. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice his yellow ball, and Alice gives Dave his brown ball.
3. **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his white ball, and Dave gives Fred his yellow ball.
4. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his black ball, and Fred gives Bob his white ball.
5. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives Dave his red ball, and Dave gives Claire his yellow ball.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob gives Dave his black ball, and Dave gives Bob his yellow ball.

**The final ball distribution:**

* Eve: **Pink ball** (from Gertrude)
* Bob: **Black ball** (from Fred)
* Claire: **Red ball** (from Dave)
* Dave: **Yellow ball** (from Alice)
* Fred: **White ball** (from Bob)
* Gertrude: **Orange ball** (from Eve)
* Alice: **Brown ball** (from Dave)


**The answer is (E) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

* **Bob and Dave switch partners:**  This means Dave is now with Ophelia.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:** This means Fred is now with Alice.
* **Fred and Bob switch partners:** This means Bob is now with Gertrude.
* **Eve and Bob switch partners:** This means Eve is now with Gertrude.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means Alice is now with Bob.
* **Fred and Claire switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Eve.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Bob. 


The answer is **(C) Ophelia**.

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Eve and Gertrude swap books, so Eve now has Gertrude's book. 
Bob and Eve swap books, so Bob now has Eve's book.
Alice and Gertrude swap books, so Alice now has Gertrude's book.
Claire and Eve swap books, so Claire now has Eve's book.
Eve and Alice swap books, so Alice now has Eve's book.
Fred and Alice swap books, so Fred now has Alice's book.
Eve and Dave swap books, so Dave now has Eve's book.

Eve ends up with Dave's book. 


The correct answer is **(B) Catch-22**. 



"
"Eve is the striker!  The final position is striker. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the moves! 

Alice starts as a Left Midfielder.  Then, she and Dave switch places.  Then, she and Claire switch places.  Then, they switch again.  Then, Claire and Fred switch places.  Then, Dave and Eve switch places.  Finally, Gertrude and Bob switch places. 

This means Alice ends up as a Left Winger! 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"The final swap is between Alice and Dave.  Since Alice started with a red ball, and Dave started with a blue ball, the final swap leaves Dave with the blue ball and Alice with the red ball. 

The correct answer is **(D) blue ball.**

"The answer is **(C) purple ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

* Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's yellow ball and Eve gets Alice's purple ball.
* Dave and Fred swap, so Dave gets Fred's pink ball and Fred gets Dave's white ball.
* Alice and Gertrude swap, so Alice gets Gertrude's black ball and Gertrude gets Alice's purple ball.
* Fred and Claire swap, so Fred gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Fred's white ball.
* Bob and Fred swap, so Bob gets Fred's white ball and Fred gets Bob's brown ball.
* Gertrude and Bob swap, so Gertrude gets Bob's brown ball and Bob gets Gertrude's black ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.

The final ball that Alice holds is the purple ball.

"Eve is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(G) Jamie**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) blue present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets yellow, Fred gets orange.
2. Bob and Fred swap: Bob gets yellow, Fred gets orange.
3. Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets orange, Dave gets blue.
4. Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets pink, Claire gets orange.
5. Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets purple, Eve gets orange.
6. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets black, Bob gets purple.
7. Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets white, Alice gets black.

Dave ends up with the blue present.

"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!  

Gertrude starts with the orange ball.  Here's how the swaps go:

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets red, Eve gets white.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  Claire gets orange, Gertrude gets pink.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Gertrude gets black, Dave gets orange.
* **Eve and Fred swap:**  Eve gets brown, Fred gets red.
* **Fred and Bob swap:**  Fred gets white, Bob gets brown.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets yellow, Alice gets pink.
* **Fred and Bob swap:**  Fred gets orange, Bob gets white.

**The final gift Gertrude has is the pink ball!**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Fred and Gertrude switch partners:** Fred-Lola, Gertrude-Fred
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners:** Dave-Sam, Claire-Dave
3. **Dave and Bob switch partners:** Dave-Rodrigo, Bob-Dave
4. **Bob and Claire switch partners:** Bob-Sam, Claire-Bob
5. **Alice and Gertrude switch partners:** Alice-Rodrigo, Gertrude-Alice
6. **Dave and Alice switch partners:** Dave-Jamie, Alice-Dave
7. **Eve and Gertrude switch partners:** Eve-Lola, Gertrude-Eve

Now, let's see who Alice is dancing with at the end. 

**Answer:** Alice is dancing with **Sam**. 



"
"The answer is **(C) green ball**. 

Here's why:  Let's break down the trades and see how the balls are distributed:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her orange ball, and Eve gives Alice her yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her orange ball, and Claire gives Alice her brown ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his white ball, and Claire gives Bob his brown ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude his red ball, and Gertrude gives Dave his green ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his white ball, and Fred gives Bob his black ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her yellow ball, and Claire gives Eve her brown ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave his green ball, and Dave gives Gertrude his red ball. 


Gertrude ends up with the green ball. 
"
"Fred is dancing with Melissa!  

The answer is (D). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Claire has:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Blue
    * Bob: Purple
    * Claire: White
    * Dave: Orange
    * Eve: Yellow
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Pink

* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  This changes Bob's present to Pink and Gertrude's to Purple.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Orange and Dave's to Pink.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This changes Eve's present to Pink and Gertrude's to Yellow.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes Bob's present to Yellow and Dave's to Pink.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Orange and Dave's to White.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Fred's present to Blue and Alice's to Brown.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes Bob's present to Yellow and Eve's to Blue.

**Final State:**

* **Claire:**  We need to figure out what Claire's present is.  

**The answer is (D) orange ball.**

    * Bob: Center Midfielder
    * Claire: Benchwarmer
    * Dave: Cheerleader
    * Eve: Striker
    * Fred: Right Midfielder

    * Dave and Gertrude swap:  Dave becomes Right Winger, Gertrude becomes Cheerleader
    * Dave and Fred swap: Dave becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger
    * Alice and Dave swap: Alice becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Right Winger
    * Alice and Gertrude swap: Alice becomes Right Winger, Gertrude becomes Center Midfielder
    * Bob and Eve swap: Bob becomes Striker, Eve becomes Right Winger
    * Dave and Alice swap: Dave becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Center Midfielder
    * Claire and Dave swap: Claire becomes Right Winger, Dave becomes Center Midfielder

* **Final Positions:**
    * Alice: Center Midfielder
    * Bob: Striker
    * Claire: **Right Winger**
    * Dave: Center Midfielder
    * Eve: Right Winger
    * Fred: Right Midfielder
    * Gertrude: Left Winger

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Bob is starting with Karl.  We know Fred and Claire switch partners, then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then Dave and Eve switch partners.  Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Alice and Bob switch partners again.  Alice and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Fred and Claire switch partners.  

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end?

"Okay, let's break down the book swap puzzle! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **The Swaps:**  We need to track the swaps to see who ends up with which book.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with The Great Gatsby, Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave starts with The Odyssey.
5. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Gertrude starts with Lolita.
6. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with The Odyssey, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.
7. **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Eve starts with Lolita.

**The Final Swap:** Fred and Eve swap books, so Eve ends up with Frankenstein.

**Therefore, the answer is (E) Frankenstein.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Bob has:

* **Start:**
    * Bob: Yellow
    * Alice: Red
    * Claire: Black
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Purple
    * Fred: White
    * Gertrude: Brown

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This changes Gertrude's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Claire's.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes Eve's present to Claire's, and Claire's present to Eve's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Gertrude's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to Bob's, and Bob's present to Fred's.

**The answer is (B) yellow.**

"Let's break down the book trades! 

Here's how the trades affect Bob's book:

1. **Bob starts with Frankenstein.**
2. **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This doesn't change Bob's book.
3. **Bob and Fred swap:** This swaps Fred's book with Bob's.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This swaps Dave's book with Bob's.
5. **Bob and Alice swap:** This swaps Alice's book with Bob's.
6. **Claire and Alice swap:** This swaps Alice's book with Claire's.
7. **Claire and Fred swap:** This swaps Fred's book with Claire's.
8. **Eve and Dave swap:** This swaps Dave's book with Eve's.

**Therefore, Bob ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.** 


**The answer is (C).**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has what at the end:

* **Start:**  Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, and so on. 

* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gets Ulysses, Gertrude gets The Odyssey. 
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets The Odyssey, Eve gets The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets The Odyssey, Gertrude gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, Eve gets Catch-22.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Alice gets The Odyssey.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets The Odyssey, Alice gets Catch-22.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Dave gets The Odyssey.

**Therefore, Alice has The Great Gatsby.** 



"
"Fred is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We know Alice has a blue present, Bob has a green present, Claire has a brown present, Dave has a purple present, Eve has an orange ball, Fred has a pink ball, and Gertrude has a red present.

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Eve's. 
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Fred's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Gertrude's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Claire's.

**The final result is that Alice has the brown present.**

"The answer is **(B) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Eve swap.
2. Dave and Fred swap.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap.
4. Fred and Claire swap.
5. Bob and Fred swap.
6. Gertrude and Bob swap.
7. Gertrude and Claire swap.

Notice that the ball swapping always results in a new player holding the ball that was previously held by the other player.  This means that the final player with the ball is the one who received the ball that was previously held by the other player. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the game! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to see how the colors are distributed at the end.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Claire and Bob:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Claire and Dave:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Fred and Gertrude:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Fred:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Alice and Dave:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.

**Conclusion:**

The swaps don't change the color of the balls. 

**Answer:**  None of the above. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Eve and Claire:** Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Claire now has the purple ball.
2. **Bob and Eve:** Bob starts with a black ball, and Eve now has a purple ball. They swap, so Bob now has the purple ball.
3. **Claire and Alice:** Claire now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Alice now has the purple ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Bob now has the pink ball.
5. **Dave and Eve:** Dave now has the purple ball, and Eve has the purple ball. They swap, so Dave now has the purple ball.
6. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred now has the purple ball, and Gertrude has the brown ball. They swap, so Fred now has the brown ball.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude now has the brown ball, and Claire has the pink ball. They swap, so Gertrude now has the pink ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the pink ball at the end of the game.** 

**The answer is (F).**

"Eve is dancing with Helga!  

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Let's break down the swaps and see who ends up with what book!

* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap books.
* **Claire and Bob:** Swap books.
* **Alice and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap books.
* **Dave and Fred:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Claire:** Swap books.
* **Eve and Fred:** Swap books.

The final swap is Eve and Fred.  

**Therefore, the answer is (E) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude gives Bob her ball, and Bob gives Gertrude his ball.
2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Dave his ball.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
4. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.
5. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Gertrude his ball.
6. **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
7. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.

**The final ball holder is Gertrude, and she has the red ball.** 

**The answer is (G).** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the dance swaps! 

* **Dave starts with Helga.**
* **Fred and Eve switch partners.**
* **Bob and Eve switch partners.**
* **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
* **Bob and Fred switch partners.**
* **Bob and Gertrude switch partners.**
* **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
* **Claire and Alice switch partners.**

The final dance is a bit tricky, but we can see that Dave is now dancing with someone new. 

**The answer is (A) Ophelia.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Fred swapped balls, then Dave and Claire, and so on.  Let's see who ends up with what ball. 

* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with pink, Eve starts with orange. They swap, so Fred now has orange and Eve has pink.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with black, Claire starts with red. They swap, so Claire now has black and Dave has red.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice starts with white, Gertrude starts with purple. They swap, so Gertrude now has white and Alice has purple.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude now has white, Eve has pink. They swap, so Eve now has white and Gertrude has pink.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve now has white, Fred has orange. They swap, so Fred now has white and Eve has orange.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred now has white, Alice has orange. They swap, so Alice now has white and Fred has orange.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice now has white, Bob has yellow. They swap, so Bob now has white and Alice has yellow.

**Therefore, Bob has the yellow ball at the end.** 

**Answer:** (D) 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!  

Claire starts with a pink ball.  We know that the gifts are swapped around, but the colors don't change.  

The answer is **(G) pink ball**. 



"
"Eve ends up with the green present!  The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice's pink goes to Claire's blue.
2. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's brown goes to Bob's red.
3. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice's pink goes to Gertrude's black.
4. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire's blue goes to Gertrude's black.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's pink goes to Eve's yellow.
6. **Fred and Dave swap:** Fred's white goes to Dave's brown.
7. **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire's blue goes to Alice's pink.

**The final gift Dave has is the one that was originally Bob's red present.** 

The answer is **(E) red present**.

"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Bob starts with a black ball.  

* **First swap:** Bob and Claire swap.  Claire's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Claire. 
* **Second swap:** Bob and Alice swap. Alice's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Alice. 

The only way Bob ends up with the white present is if he started with the white present. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is right midfielder, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left winger.
* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes right winger, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes left winger, Alice becomes goalkeeper.
* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes goalkeeper, Bob becomes left winger.

So, at the end of the match, Bob is playing left winger. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"The answer is **(C) Ulysses**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Alice starts with Frankenstein:** She gets it at the beginning.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means they both trade books, so Alice gets The Great Gatsby and Bob gets Frankenstein.
3. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets The Great Gatsby and Bob gets Ulysses.
4. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob gets Ulysses and Alice gets The Great Gatsby. 


Let me know if you have any other book-related puzzles! 📚 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Alice starts with a red present.  Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a white present.  

Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Claire's. 
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Alice's.

After the swaps, Alice will have Bob's present, which is the black ball. 

**Therefore, the answer is (A) black ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(C).**  Bob ends up with the brown ball. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can break down the gift exchange:

* **Start:** Alice has a white present, Bob has an orange ball, and Claire has a brown present. 
* **Bob and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Bob Swap:**  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.

**The key is that the order of the swaps matters.**  

**Therefore, we can't determine the final color of the present Bob has.** 

**The answer is (None of the above)** 



"
"The final position Claire ends up in is fullback.  

The correct answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The answer is **(B)**.  Claire starts as a left winger, and after the trades, she ends up back in that position. 
"
"The answer is **(C) Melissa**. 

Here's why:

* Bob and Claire switch partners first.
* Then Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners again. 

This means that Bob ends up dancing with Melissa. 
"
"The answer is **(B) pink ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice gets Bob's pink ball, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Alice gets Claire's purple present, and Claire gets Alice's blue present. 

Let me know if you have any other fun scenarios you'd like to explore! 
"
"The answer is **(A)**.  Here's why:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire starts with a white ball, and Alice starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Claire gets the yellow ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice now has the white ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the white ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has the white ball, and Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the white ball and Bob gets the orange ball. 



 
"
"The answer is **(C).**  Claire ends up playing fullback. 
"
"The answer is **(C) yellow present**. 

Here's why:

* Claire starts with a pink ball.
* Alice starts with a yellow present.
* Bob starts with a red present.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Bob's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Claire's present, and Bob gets Alice's present.

Since Claire started with a pink ball, and Alice started with a yellow present, the only possible outcome is that Claire ends up with the yellow present.

"Let's break down the book swapping! 

Here's how the books change hands:

1. **Initial Ownership:**
   * Alice: Lolita
   * Bob: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring

2. **Bob and Claire Swap:**  Bob gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Bob's book. This means:
   * Bob now has The Fellowship of the Ring
   * Claire now has Hound of the Baskervilles

3. **Alice and Bob Swap:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book. This means:
   * Alice now has Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Bob now has The Fellowship of the Ring

4. **Final Result:**
   * Alice: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring
   * Claire: Lolita


**Therefore, the answer is (C) Hound of the Baskervilles.** 
"
"The answer is **(A) Patrick**. 

Here's why:

* Alice and Bob switch partners first, so Alice is now with Claire and Bob is with Lola.
* Then, Claire and Bob switch partners, so Claire is now with Alice and Bob is with Patrick.
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire and Alice is with Rodrigo. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the gift exchange! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with the green present:

* **Alice starts with yellow**
* **Bob starts with blue**
* **Claire starts with green**

We need to figure out the order of the swaps.  

**The key is that the order of the swaps matters.**

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Alice and Bob swap first:**  This means they exchange their presents.  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Alice swap first:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
* **Alice and Bob swap second:** This means they exchange their presents again.

**The only way Alice ends up with the green present is if Claire and Alice swap first.**

**Therefore, the answer is (A) green present.**

"Okay, so let's think about the positions! 

* **Start:** Alice is center midfielder, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left winger.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire becomes goalkeeper, Alice becomes left winger.

"The answer is **(B) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Initial State:** Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *Catch-22*, and Claire has *Ulysses*.

2. **Bob and Claire Swap:** Bob gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *Catch-22*.

3. **Claire and Alice Swap:** Claire gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Alice gets *Catch-22*. 


Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Alice starts with a red present, Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a pink ball.  

Here's how the swapping works:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice starts with a red present, and Claire starts with a pink ball, they swap.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Claire's pink ball, and Bob has Alice's red present, they swap.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Bob's red present, and Claire has Bob's black ball, they swap.

**Therefore, Claire ends up with the black ball.**

"The answer is **(A) Melissa**. 

Here's why:

* Bob and Alice switch partners first, so Bob is now with Melissa.
* Then, Claire and Alice switch partners, so Bob is now with Alice. 
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners again, leaving Bob with Melissa. 



"
"The answer is **(C) The Odyssey**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Alice starts with Frankenstein.**
2. **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets Lolita, and Claire gets Frankenstein.
3. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Frankenstein, and Alice gets The Odyssey.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, and Bob gets Lolita. 

This means Alice ends up with The Odyssey. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Here's how the gift exchange works:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Alice's, and Alice's present becomes Claire's. 
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Alice's.

The important thing to remember is that the gifts are swapped, not necessarily the colors. 

So, let's think about the starting positions:

* **Bob starts with the purple present.**
* **Alice starts with the orange ball.**
* **Claire starts with the blue present.**

After the swaps, Bob will have the blue present. 

**Therefore, the answer is (C).** 



"
"The final dance will be Claire with Rodrigo. 

The answer is **(C) Rodrigo**. 
"
"The answer is **(C) Izzi**. 

Here's why:

* Claire and Alice switch partners first, so Claire is now with Bob.
* Then Bob and Claire switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire.
* Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Claire. 



Let me know if you have any other dance-related questions! 
"
"The answer is **(B)**.  Bob ends up with the orange ball. 
"
"The final dance partner for Alice is Ophelia!  

Here's why:

Since Bob and Alice switch partners twice, and they start with Bob and Alice, the final dance partner for Alice is **Melissa**.

"The answer is **(B)**.  Here's why:

Let's break down the gift exchange:

1. **Initial State:** Alice has green, Bob has blue, and Claire has brown.

2. **Claire and Alice Swap:**  Claire's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Claire. This means Claire now has the green present, and Alice has the brown present.

3. **Claire and Bob Swap:** Claire's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Claire. This means Bob now has the green present, and Claire has the blue present.

4. **Alice and Claire Swap:** Alice's present goes to Claire, and Claire's present goes to Alice. This means Bob has the blue present. 



 
"
"The answer is **(C) red ball**. 

Here's why:

* Alice and Bob swap, with Alice getting Bob's orange ball and Bob getting Alice's orange ball.
* Then, Claire and Bob swap, with Claire getting Bob's orange ball and Bob getting Claire's black ball.
* Finally, Alice and Claire swap, with Alice getting Claire's orange ball and Claire getting Alice's red ball.

"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Alice starts with a green present. Bob starts with a red present, and Claire starts with a purple present.  

Here's how the swaps work:

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Claire's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Claire's. 
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Claire's, and Claire's present becomes Alice's.

The final state is:

* **Alice has Bob's present (red).**
* **Bob has Claire's present (purple).**
* **Claire has Alice's present (green).**

So the answer is **(C) green present**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance moves play out:

* **Start:** Alice - Jamie, Bob - Karl, Claire - Patrick
* **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire and Bob switch partners.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice and Claire switch partners.

**The final dance:**  We need to figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end.

**The answer is (B) Patrick.** 



"
"The answer is **(B) Catch-22**. 

Here's why:

* Alice starts with *Lolita*.
* Alice and Claire swap books, giving Claire *The Great Gatsby* and Alice *Lolita*.
* Bob and Alice swap books, giving Bob *The Great Gatsby* and Alice *Catch-22*.

"
"The answer is **(B)**.  

Here's why:

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This leaves Bob with the orange ball and Claire with the red present.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This leaves Alice with the red present and Claire with the blue present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This leaves Bob with the blue present and Alice with the orange ball.

"The answer is **(C) Sam**. 

Here's why:

* Bob and Alice switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is with Sam.
* Bob and Claire switch partners, so Bob is now with Alice, and Claire is with Sam.
* Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Bob, and Claire is with Sam. 



Let me know if you have any other dance-related questions!

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can break down the gift exchange:

* **Start:** Alice (red), Bob (black), Claire (white)
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they exchange gifts.  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. Again, we don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.

The key is that the order of the swaps matters.  

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Scenario 1:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, then Claire would end up with the red present. 
* **Scenario 2:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, then Claire would end up with the black ball. 
* **Scenario 3:** If Bob and Claire swap, and then Alice and Bob swap, and then Claire and Alice swap, then Claire would end up with the white present. 

**Therefore, the answer is (C) black ball.**

Let's look at the final dance:
