"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  Clue 2 tells us the person with a vase of tulips lives to the left of the guitarist.  Clue 3 tells us the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person with carnations.

We also know there is one house between the flutist and the pianist. 

Let's look at the possibilities:

* **Option A:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 2.
* **Option B:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 3.
* **Option C:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 4.
* **Option D:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 5.

We can eliminate options A and B because the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in the same house as the guitarist. 

We can also eliminate option C because the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person with carnations. 

Therefore, the only option left is **Option D**.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

We know the mystery book reader lives in the second house.  The bird keeper is not in the third house.  The percussionist is to the left of the computer owner, and the gameboy owner is to the left of the rose bouquet owner.  The cellist is not in the third house.

Let's look at the clues and see what we can figure out:

* **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
* **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses. 


The person with the gameboy lives in house **(C) 2**. 



 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  It's a bit tricky, but I'm up for the challenge.  

Here's what we need to do:

* **Start with the most direct clues:**  These are the clues that give us the most specific information.
* **Use logic:**  We need to use the clues to figure out relationships between the people and their characteristics. 
* **Eliminate possibilities:**  As we go through the clues, we'll eliminate houses and possibilities.

Let's get started! 


**Question 1:**  What is the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives?

**(A) 5**
**(B) 3**
**(C) 1**
**(D) 4**
**(E) 2**


 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know the person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who likes history books.  

We also know the person wearing boots lives in a house other than the first one. 

So, the person wearing boots can't be in house 1.  

The only house left for the person wearing boots is house 2. 


The answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

We know the golfer lives in the first house.  We also know the swimmer lives to the left of the romance book lover.  The mystery book reader lives to the left of the history book buff.  The swimmer doesn't live in the third house.  The basketball player doesn't live in the fourth house.

Let's put it all together:

1. **Golfer** lives in the first house.
2. **Swimmer** lives to the left of the romance book lover.
3. **Mystery book reader** lives to the left of the history book buff.
4. **Swimmer** does not live in the third house.
5. **Basketball player** does not live in the fourth house.

So, the order of the houses is:

1. Golfer
2. Mystery book reader
3. Swimmer
4. Romance book lover
5. History book buff
6. Basketball player

The basketball player must be in house **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the mystery book reader lives in the third house.  And we know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the romance book lover.  

Since the person wearing sandals is to the left of the romance book lover, and the romance book lover is in a house with a different book preference than the mystery book reader, the romance book lover must be in the house to the right of the mystery book reader.

We also know the person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.  The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers.  And the person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.

Let's think about the remaining houses.  

**The answer is (B) 3.** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the person who likes green lives to the left of the person with the gameboy.  And the person with the gameboy lives to the left of the person with the computer.  

This means the order is: Green - Gameboy - Computer. 

The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house.  

So, the person with the computer must live in the first house. 


**Answer:** 1 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

We know a few things about the people and their houses:

* **Clue 1:** There are two houses between the person who likes white and the coffee drinker.
* **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
* **Clue 7:** The romance book lover lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the coffee drinker lives. 

**Clue 1 and 5:** The root beer lover is in the third house.
**Clue 7 and 8:** The romance book lover is in the third house, and the history book buff is to their left.

Now, let's use the other clues to fill in the gaps. 

**Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. 
**Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house. 
**Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house. 
**Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.  The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.  

Clue 1 tells us the person who likes green lives to the left of the person with the radio.  

We also know the pizza person does not live in house 1. 

So, the cat lover lives in house 2. 


**Answer: B** 
"
"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  It's like a fun little game of detective work.  We need to find the house where the person who only drinks water lives.  

Here's what we know:

* **We have clues about the houses and their occupants:**  We know who lives in each house and what they like. 
* **We need to find the pattern:**  We need to figure out how these things connect.

Let's start by looking for the most direct clues.  

**Here's what I'm thinking:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
* **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the second house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
* **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
* **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
* **Clue 8:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 9:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
* **Clue 10:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
* **Clue 12:** The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
* **Clue 14:** The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 16:** There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
* **Clue 17:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 18:** The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.

**Now, let's see if we can figure out the answer!**

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  

We have a lot of information, so let's break it down step by step. 

**Here's what we know:**

* **House 3:** The person who likes milk lives here.
* **House 3:** The person who is eating apples lives here.
* **House 3:** The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.
* **House 3:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
* **House 4:** The person who owns a sedan lives here.

**Now, let's use these clues to figure out the location of the sedan owner.** 

**Answer:**  The sedan owner lives in **house 4**. 


 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the person who drives a truck is not in the third house, and the person who owns an SUV is not in the third house. This means the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV cannot be in the same house. 

We also know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

So, the person who owns an SUV must live in house number 2. 


**Answer:**  (B) 2 
"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.  And the person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.  

We also know the swimmer lives in the first house.  And the cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

So, the order must be:

1. Swimmer
2. Spaghetti
3. Fried Rice

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house **2**. 


 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the second house.
* **Clue 6:** The person who wears loafers lives in the third house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

* The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
* The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

* **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

* The person who likes yellow lives in the house next to the person wearing boots. 
* The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house. 
* The person who likes yellow lives in the house next to the person wearing boots. 

**Therefore, the person who likes green lives in house number (C) 2.**

We also know the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. 

Let's put it all together!

Let's think about the clues:

* **Clue 1:** The person who drives a truck lives to the right of the basketball player.

"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  It's a bit tricky, but I'm up for the challenge.

**2.  Use the clues to deduce relationships:**

* **Start by identifying the most restrictive clues:**  These are clues that limit the possibilities of a house.
* **Look for patterns:**  See if you can find any patterns in the clues that can help you narrow down the possibilities.

**3.  Work through the puzzle:**

* **Use the clues to eliminate possibilities:**  As you solve clues, eliminate houses that are no longer possible.
* **Be careful with multiple clues:**  Sometimes, multiple clues can be used to eliminate possibilities.


I'll keep working through the clues and let you know what I find!

"The person with the computer lives in house 2. 

**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.  That means the golfer must be in house 2.  

The person who had pizza and the history book buff live next to each other. This means the pizza eater must be in house 1.

The guitarist lives to the right of the person with daffodils.

So, the golfer is in house 2, the pizza eater is in house 1, and the guitarist is to the right of the person with daffodils.  

The percussionist must be in house 1. 


**Answer:** The percussionist lives in **(B) 1**. 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

First, we need to figure out where the percussionist lives.  We know the violinist lives in the fourth house, and the bird keeper lives in the fifth house.  

Let's start by looking at the clues that tell us about the people and their houses:

* **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 4:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
* **Clue 6:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
* **Clue 7:** The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
* **Clue 8:** The violinist lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who owns horses lives.
* **Clue 10:** The bird keeper lives in the fifth house.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the location of the percussionist.

"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the person with the lilies lives in house 1.  And we know the basketball player is in house 2.  

Clue 1 tells us the person with the radio is to the right of the person eating apples.  Clue 2 tells us the person with the radio is to the right of the violinist. 

So, the violinist must be in house 1. 


**Answer:**  House 1 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

We know the tennis player lives in the third house.  The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.  The golfer lives in the fourth house.  We also know that there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti. 

Let's think about the clues:

* **Clue 5:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
* **Clue 6:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

This tells us that the cricketer must be in a house to the left of the person who had pizza.

"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the root beer lover doesn't live in the second house.  We also know the person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house.  This means the root beer lover can't be in house 2.

We also know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos.  

The only remaining possibility is house 3. 


**Answer:** The root beer lover lives in **(C) 3**.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  It's a bit tricky, but I'm up for the challenge.  

Here's what we know:

* **We have four houses, and each person has a unique characteristic:**  This means we need to figure out who lives in each house based on the clues. 

Let's start by looking for clues that give us the most information. 

**Here are some things we know:**

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

* **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 2:** The violinist does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 3:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by looking at the clues that tell us where people *don't* live.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  It's a bit tricky, but I'm up for the challenge.  

Here's what I'm thinking:

* **Start with the most direct clues:**  We need to figure out the order of the houses and the people's locations. 
* **Focus on key information:**  We need to pay attention to the specific details about the people and their preferences.

Let's see...

**1.  The romance book lover lives in the fifth house.**

**2.  The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.**

**3.  The person who likes white and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.**

**4.  The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.**

**5.  The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.**

**6.  There is one house between where the person who has a vase of tulips lives and where the romance book lover lives.**

**7.  The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.**

**8.  The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.**

**9.  The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other.**

**10. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**

**11. The person who owns horses lives in the second house.**

**Now, let's see...**

**Which house is the cat lover in?**

**(A) 1**
**(B) 5**
**(C) 3**
**(D) 2**

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  

We have a fun little house puzzle.  Here's what we know:

* **People and their houses:**  We have four houses, numbered 1 to 4. Each house has a person living there.
* **Favorite things:** Each person has a favorite color, lunch, and fruit, and a favorite drink. 
* **Clues:** We have some clues to help us figure out where everyone lives.

Let's start by looking at the clues and seeing what we can figure out. 

**Here are some things to keep in mind:**

* **Direct clues:** These clues tell us exactly where people live.
* **Indirect clues:** These clues tell us about relationships between people.

**Let's start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
* **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  It's like a fun little game of detective work!  

Here's what we know:

* **Houses and their occupants:** We have 5 houses, each with a person and their unique characteristics. 
* **Flowers, music, cars, books, and pets:**  Each person has a specific flower, instrument, car, book, and pet. 
* **Clues:** We have a bunch of clues that connect these details.

Let's start by looking for the most important clues.  We need to find the house where the person who drives a minivan lives. 

**Here's what I'm thinking:**

* **Clue 1:** There's one house between the person who owns horses and the person with daffodils.
* **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** There's one house between the convertible owner and the bird keeper.
* **Clue 4:** The pianist lives to the right of the bird keeper.
* **Clue 5:** The person with lilies doesn't live in the fifth house.
* **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast doesn't live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 7:** The fantasy book enthusiast doesn't live in the fifth house.
* **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives to the left of the sedan owner.
* **Clue 9:** There are two houses between the carnations arrangement person and the cellist.
* **Clue 10:** The fantasy book enthusiast and the history book buff live next to each other.
* **Clue 11:** The person with daffodils lives to the left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 12:** The person who drives a convertible lives to the left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 13:** The person with a rose bouquet lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 14:** The flutist doesn't live in the first house.
* **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the romance book lover.
* **Clue 16:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
* **Clue 17:** The history book buff doesn't live in the fifth house.
* **Clue 18:** The person with carnations arrangement doesn't live in the fifth house.
* **Clue 19:** The person who drives a minivan doesn't live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 20:** The person who owns an SUV lives to the left of the person with a rose bouquet.

**Now, let's see...**

I think I can figure out the location of the minivan owner.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  It's a bit tricky, but we can figure it out.  

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 3:** The dog owner lives in the second house.
* **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
* **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.

We know the dog owner and fish enthusiast are in houses 2 and 3.  

Let's see what else we can figure out.

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

We know a few things for sure:

* **The basketball player lives in the first house.**
* **The saxophonist lives in the first house.**

This gives us a starting point.  Let's think about the clues and how they connect. 

**Clue 1:** There is one house between the cat lover and the guitarist.

**Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
**Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
**Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Now, let's think about the houses and the clues.  

**Which house is the dog owner in?**

**(A) 2**
**(B) 3**
**(C) 1** 


 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the history book buff lives in the first house.  We also know the cat lover doesn't live in the second house.  

Clue 1 tells us the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person with daffodils.  Clue 4 tells us the person wearing loafers lives to the right of the person with a computer.

Putting it all together, we can figure out the order of the houses.  The person with lilies lives in house 1.

**(C) 3**
**(D) 2**
**(E) 4**

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm going to use my detective skills to figure out where the pianist lives. 

Here's what I'm thinking:

* **Clue 1:**  We know there are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person eating apples.
* **Clue 2:** The baseball player doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

**Which house is the pianist in?**

**(A) 4**
**(B) 3**
**(C) 1**
**(D) 2**

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person who likes white lives in the first house.  We also know the person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house.  

The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing high heels.  The person wearing boots also lives to the left of the person who had stew. 

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. 


**Answer: 1**

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

We know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2.  And we know the person with the science fiction book fanatic lives next to them.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.  We also know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.  

Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, and the fried rice person is in the second house, the spaghetti person must be in the first house. 

The person who ate fried rice is in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house. 

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"The carnation person lives in house 1.  

**Answer: B** 
"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person who only drinks water lives to the left of the person wearing high heels.  We also know the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes yellow.  

Since the person who likes yellow lives in house 1, and the person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who likes yellow, the person wearing sandals lives in house 2. 

So the answer is **2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know a few things:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
* **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

**Here's how it works:**

* Since the person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes live next to each other, and the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television, we can deduce the following:
    * The person with a television is to the right of the person wearing sandals.
    * The person wearing sandals is to the left of the person eating grapes.
    * The person eating grapes is to the left of the person who drinks tea.

* We also know the person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person who drinks tea.

**The only way to satisfy all the clues is if the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.** 



**Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.** 
"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.  We also know the violinist doesn't live in the third house.  

Let's think about the remaining clues:

* **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
* **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.

This tells us the order of the houses:

* T (Tea drinker)
* V (Violinist)

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.  We also know the mystery book reader lives to the left of the cat lover.  Finally, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other. 

Let's use this information to figure out where the person who had stew lives. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
* **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives to the left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other.

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the root beer lover lives in the first house.  We also know the person who only drinks water lives in the second house.  

Let's think about the clues:

* **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
* **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person who eats oranges lives in the first house.  That's a good start!  

We also know the person who owns horses lives in the third house.  

Now, let's think about the other clues.  The person who drives a truck lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible.  

We also know the person who eats mangos does not live in the third house. 

Let's think about the order of the houses.  

The person who drives a truck lives in house 2. 


**Answer: (A) 2** 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  

Here's how we can figure out where the percussionist lives.  We'll use clues to figure out the order of the houses and their occupants. 

**Let's start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.
* **Clue 2:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 3:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
* **Clue 4:** There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
* **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
* **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
* **Clue 7:** The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
* **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.
* **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

**Now, let's use these clues to create a grid:**

```
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
-------|----|----|----|----|
|  |  |  |  |  |
-------|----|----|----|----|
|  |  |  |  |  |
-------|----|----|----|----|
|  |  |  |  |  |
```

**Let's start filling in the grid:**

* **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.
* **Clue 2:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 3:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
* **Clue 4:** There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
* **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
* **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
* **Clue 7:** The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
* **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 9:** There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.

**Now, let's think about the houses and their occupants:**

* **First house:**  We know the sedan owner lives here.
* **Third house:** The romance book lover lives here.

Now, this isn't necessarily bad, but it can cause some discomfort.  You might feel that burning sensation in your muscles, and that's because lactic acid is building up.  

The good news is, your body is pretty good at clearing it out.  But if you're pushing yourself really hard, and that lactic acid builds up too much, it can make you feel tired and sore.  

So, is it bad?  Well, it's not inherently bad, but it can be a sign that you're working your muscles a bit too hard.

* **(A) Yes, it's bad.**
* **(B) No, it's not bad.**

* **Back:** The spine is a complex structure, but it can be injured by forceful blows. 


So, while the torso has some protection, it's not completely safe from blows.

Quiet, from Metal Gear, is a fascinating character.  She's incredibly skilled, a master of stealth and strategy.  She's seen things, done things, that most people can't even imagine.  

Think about it:  She's a master of intelligence gathering, a tactical genius, and a survivor.  That kind of experience would be invaluable in a lecture setting, especially one focused on strategy, security, and international relations.  

Now, there are some things to consider.  She's not exactly a traditional academic.  Her background is in the military, not academia.  That could be a hurdle for some students.  And, her past is shrouded in secrecy.  That might make it difficult for her to connect with students on a personal level. 

But, I think Quiet's unique perspective and skills could be incredibly valuable.  She'd bring a different kind of knowledge to the classroom.

"It's a fascinating question!  Godzilla's resilience is legendary, but even the strongest of creatures have limits.  While the Tohoku earthquake was a devastating natural disaster, it's hard to say for sure if it could have been enough to take down Godzilla.  

The answer is: **(A) Yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Godzilla's vulnerability:**  Godzilla's strength is often portrayed as being extraordinary, but he's not invincible.

"The Jungle Book, while a beloved classic, does contain elements that can be seen as problematic.  

**The answer is: Yes.** 

It's important to remember that the story was written in a different time, and its portrayal of certain characters and cultures can be seen as outdated and even harmful.  

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes:** The story relies on stereotypes of Native Americans, often portraying them in a simplistic and negative light. 
* **Animal Personification:** The animals in the story are often given human-like qualities and behaviors, which can be problematic as it can lead to the misrepresentation of animal behavior.
* **Colonialist Undertones:** The story is set in a romanticized version of the Indian subcontinent, which can be seen as ignoring the complex realities of colonialism and its impact on Indigenous communities.


It's important to approach classic literature with a critical eye, considering the historical context and potential for bias.

"Claire ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve ends up with the brown ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

* **Start:** Bob is the benchwarmer, Alice is the right winger, Claire is the right midfielder, Dave is the goalkeeper, and Eve is the cheerleader. 

* **Trade 1:** Bob and Alice switch positions. Bob becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.

* **Trade 2:** Dave and Claire switch positions. Dave becomes the right midfielder, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 3:** Alice and Claire switch positions. Alice becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes the right winger.

* **Trade 4:** Eve and Alice switch positions. Eve becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 5:** Dave and Bob switch positions. Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.

**So, Bob is now the goalkeeper!** 


The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

* **Start:**  Alice has Moby Dick, Bob has Lolita, Claire has The Great Gatsby, Dave has Catch-22, and Eve has Ulysses.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire now has Catch-22 and Dave has The Great Gatsby.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob now has The Great Gatsby and Claire has Catch-22.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Dave now has Ulysses and Alice has Catch-22.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave now has The Great Gatsby and Claire has Ulysses.

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire now has Ulysses and Eve has The Great Gatsby.

**Therefore, Claire ends up with Ulysses.** 


The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Claire is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **We know:** Alice has purple, Bob has white, Claire has brown, Dave has red, and Eve has yellow.
* **Swaps:**  We need to figure out what happens to each color. 

**The key is to think about the swaps and how they affect the colors.** 

Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* Eve and Claire switch partners.
* Bob and Eve switch partners.
* Dave and Bob switch partners.
* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners.

This means that the final dance is a result of all the partners switching.  

The answer is **(A) Melissa**. 



"
"The answer is **(E) black ball**. 

Here's why:

The gifts are swapped in a series of pairs.  Since Claire and Dave swap gifts, and Eve and Dave swap gifts, the gifts are not changed. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Alice has *The Great Gatsby*, Bob has *Catch-22*, Claire has *The Pearl*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  Eve and Claire swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. Eve has *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Claire has *The Pearl*.

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. Bob has *Catch-22* and Eve has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire and Dave swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. Claire has *The Pearl* and Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. Bob has *Catch-22* and Eve has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice and Bob swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. Alice has *The Great Gatsby* and Bob has *Catch-22*.

* **Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Eve ends up dancing with the person who was originally dancing with Alice.  

The answer is **(C) Ophelia**. 



"
"The answer is **(C) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's pink ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.
2. Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's orange ball, Dave gets Bob's pink ball.
3. Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets Claire's black ball, Claire gets Eve's brown present.

"
"Eve ends up with the green ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the balls are swapped:

1. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Alice's ball.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Claire's ball.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
5. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Claire's ball.

**So, the final ball distribution is:**

* **Dave:**  Blue ball
* **Eve:** Red ball
* **Bob:** Purple ball
* **Alice:** Green ball
* **Claire:** Black ball

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets the orange ball and Claire gets the black ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets the blue ball and Bob gets the red ball.
3. **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve gets the black ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets the red ball and Bob gets the brown ball.
5. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave gets the orange ball and Eve gets the black ball.

So, the final ball Alice has is the **blue ball**. 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"The answer is **(A) Ulysses**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the trades:

1. Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets Frankenstein, Eve gets Ulysses.
2. Bob and Dave swap: Dave gets Frankenstein, Bob gets Ulysses.
3. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets The Pearl, Bob gets Ulysses.
4. Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob gets Ulysses.
5. Claire and Eve swap: Claire gets The Pearl, Eve gets Frankenstein.

Bob ends up with Ulysses. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:**  Alice has Lolita, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has Frankenstein, Dave has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Eve has Ulysses.

2. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's book becomes Alice's, and Alice's book becomes Eve's.  This means Eve now has The Great Gatsby and Alice now has Ulysses.

3. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's book becomes Bob's, and Bob's book becomes Dave's. This means Dave now has Ulysses and Bob now has Frankenstein.

4. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's book becomes Claire's, and Claire's book becomes Eve's. This means Eve now has Hound of the Baskervilles and Claire now has Ulysses.

5. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob's book becomes Alice's, and Alice's book becomes Bob's. This means Bob now has Frankenstein and Alice now has Ulysses.

6. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's book becomes Dave's, and Dave's book becomes Claire's. This means Claire now has Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave now has Ulysses.

**So, Bob ends up with Frankenstein.** 


**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Claire ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The final position Alice is playing is right winger! 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) Lolita**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the trades:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire now has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Alice has The Pearl.
2. **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave has Lolita, and Alice has The Pearl.
3. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve has Catch-22, and Bob has Ulysses.
4. **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave has Lolita, and Bob has Ulysses.
5. **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob has Ulysses, and Claire has Lolita. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob starts with Rodrigo, then Claire and Patrick switch partners.  Then, Bob and Eve switch partners.  Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Claire and Bob switch partners again.  

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 

**(A) Izzi** 


"
"The answer is **(C) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice:**  Claire starts with a black ball, Alice starts with a brown ball.
2. **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with a black ball, Alice starts with a purple ball.
3. **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with a purple ball, Dave starts with a yellow ball.
4. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with a yellow ball, Claire starts with a green ball.
5. **Alice and Bob:** Bob starts with a purple ball, Alice starts with a brown ball. 


Let me know if you'd like to play another game! 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Eve starts with a black ball.  We know that Claire and Dave swap gifts, and then Bob and Claire swap gifts.  Then, Claire and Dave swap gifts again.  Finally, Alice and Eve swap gifts. 

The key is that the gifts are swapped, not necessarily the colors. 

**Therefore, Eve ends up with the black ball.** 

The answer is (A). 



"
"Dave ends up with Lolita! 

The correct answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave and Eve switch partners, then Alice and Claire switch partners again.  This means Dave is now with Rodrigo, and Alice is with Patrick.  

So the answer is **(D) Patrick**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final gift:

* **Dave and Eve:**  They swap, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's present.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Eve's present and Eve gets Claire's present.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Dave's present and Dave gets Bob's present.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's present.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Dave's present and Dave gets Alice's present.

**The final gift is the one that Dave received in the last swap.**

"The answer is **(D) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the trades:

1. Eve and Alice swap books. Eve gets Dave's book (The Odyssey), and Alice gets Eve's book (Frankenstein).
2. Bob and Eve swap books. Bob gets Eve's book (Frankenstein), and Eve gets Bob's book (Moby Dick).
3. Claire and Dave swap books. Claire gets Dave's book (The Odyssey), and Dave gets Claire's book (The Fellowship of the Ring). 


This means Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We know Alice has a red present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire now has the red present.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has the red present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Bob now has the red present.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has the red present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Claire now has the red present.

**Therefore, the answer is (A) red present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Alice and Eve:**  Alice starts with yellow, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow and Alice gets the green.
2. **Bob and Dave:**  Bob starts with orange, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Dave gets the orange and Bob gets the purple.
3. **Bob and Eve:** Bob gets the green from Eve, and Eve gets the orange from Bob.
4. **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with red, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the red and Claire gets the green.
5. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets the orange from Bob, and Alice gets the purple from Dave.

**Dave ends up with the green present.**

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Eve ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The final position Alice ends up in is Center Midfielder!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve it:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob's ball becomes Dave's present, and Dave's ball becomes Bob's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Dave's present, and Dave's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Eve's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's present, and Bob's present becomes Alice's present.

"Okay, so let's break down the dance moves! 

* **Start:** Alice is with Melissa, Bob is with Patrick, Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Lola, and Eve is with Rodrigo. 
* **Alice and Claire switch:**  Alice is now with Izzi, and Claire is with Melissa.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave is now with Rodrigo, and Eve is with Lola.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice is now with Patrick, and Claire is with Bob.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice is now with Bob, and Eve is with Izzi.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave is now with Patrick, and Bob is with Izzi.

**So, Claire is dancing with Bob at the end of the dance.** 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) Ophelia**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the steps:

1.  Bob and Eve switch partners.
2.  Alice and Bob switch partners.
3.  Eve and Bob switch partners.
4.  Dave and Alice switch partners.
5.  Eve and Claire switch partners.

This means that Bob and Eve switch partners first, then Alice and Bob switch partners, and then Eve and Bob switch partners again.  Then, Dave and Alice switch partners. Finally, Eve and Claire switch partners. 


 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions:

* **Start:** Bob is center midfielder, Claire is fullback, Dave is striker, Alice is benchwarmer, and Eve is left winger.

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave becomes left winger, Eve becomes striker.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes fullback, Claire becomes striker.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes left winger, Dave becomes striker.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes benchwarmer, Alice becomes center midfielder.

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Claire and Bob:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Bob and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.

**The key is that each swap involves two people trading, and the colors are always changing.**

**Therefore, Dave will have the blue ball at the end.** 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts are swapped:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now with Alice, and Alice's present is now with Claire.
2. **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Bob.
3. **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Alice.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Bob.
5. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Dave.

**The final gift is Dave's present.  The answer is (A) yellow present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives her black ball to Eve, and Eve gets Alice's black ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives his yellow ball to Claire, and Claire gets Dave's yellow ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gives his yellow ball to Eve, and Eve gets Dave's yellow ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives her orange ball to Eve, and Eve gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob gives his green ball to Eve, and Eve gets Bob's green ball.

Eve ends up with all the balls that were originally held by the other players. 

So, the answer is **(E) green ball**.

* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's ball becomes Claire's, and Claire's ball becomes Alice's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve's ball becomes Alice's, and Alice's ball becomes Eve's.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire's ball becomes Bob's, and Bob's ball becomes Claire's.

2. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice starts with an orange ball, and Dave now has the brown ball. They swap, so Alice now has the brown ball and Dave has the orange ball.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has the brown ball, and Claire starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Claire now has the brown ball and Alice has the yellow ball.
4. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave now has the orange ball, and Bob starts with a white ball. They swap, so Dave now has the white ball and Bob has the orange ball.
5. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve now has the orange ball, and Dave now has the brown ball.

   * Alice: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Eve: Frankenstein

**Therefore, Bob ends up with Frankenstein.** 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the book trades work:

1. **Start:**  Alice has Catch-22, Bob has The Odyssey, Claire has Moby Dick, Dave has Lolita, and Eve has Frankenstein.

2. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire now has The Odyssey, and Eve now has Moby Dick.

3. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice now has The Odyssey, and Bob now has Catch-22.

4. **Bob and Eve swap:**  This means Bob now has Moby Dick, and Eve now has Catch-22.

5. **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve now has Catch-22, and Alice now has Moby Dick.

6. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob now has Lolita, and Dave now has Frankenstein.

**Therefore, Dave ends up with Lolita.** 


The answer is **(B)**.

"The final ball Alice has is the yellow ball. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Eve is dancing with Karl at the end!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We have Alice (purple), Bob (white), Claire (yellow), Dave (pink), and Eve (green).

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Claire's.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Dave's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Dave's.

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This means Eve's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Eve's.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Alice's.

**The final gift is:**

**(B) yellow present.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  This means Dave gets a new gift, and Bob gets a new gift.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.

**The key is that each swap involves two people exchanging gifts.**  

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Dave and Claire:**  They swap, so Dave now has Claire's gift.
* **Dave and Bob:**  They swap, so Dave now has Bob's gift.
* **Claire and Eve:**  They swap, so Claire now has Eve's gift.
* **Eve and Alice:**  They swap, so Eve now has Alice's gift.

**Therefore, Dave ends up with the gift that was originally Claire's.** 

**The answer is (E) pink ball.** 



"
"Eve ends up with the blue ball!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) red ball**. 

Here's why:

* Bob starts with a yellow ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the yellow ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the white ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
* Claire and Bob swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Bob gets the red ball. 



"
"The answer is **(A) white ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Dave and Alice swap, Dave gets the brown ball, Alice gets the pink ball.
2. Alice and Claire swap, Claire gets the pink ball, Alice gets the orange ball.
3. Claire and Bob swap, Bob gets the pink ball, Claire gets the blue ball.
4. Eve and Bob swap, Bob gets the white ball, Eve gets the blue ball.
5. Alice and Dave swap, Dave gets the orange ball, Alice gets the pink ball.

Bob ends up with the white ball.

Here's what we know:

* **Alice and Claire switch partners.**  
* **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
* **Dave and Bob switch partners.**
* **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
* **Dave and Eve switch partners.**

Let's think about who is left with whom at the end. 


**The answer is (E) Patrick.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, Dave is with Helga, Alice is with Jamie, Bob is with Patrick, Claire is with Karl, and Eve is with Izzi. 

Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.  This means Claire is now with Bob, and Alice is with Dave.

Then, Alice and Dave switch partners. This means Alice is now with Bob, and Dave is with Claire.

Alice and Bob switch partners again. This means Alice is now with Dave, and Bob is with Claire.

Bob and Eve switch partners. This means Bob is now with Eve, and Dave is with Claire.

Finally, Dave and Bob switch partners. This means Dave is now with Eve, and Bob is with Claire.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Eve. 


The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire gets the brown present and Alice gets the orange ball.
2. **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets the pink ball and Bob gets the orange ball.
3. **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets the orange ball and Claire gets the pink ball.
4. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets the pink ball and Alice gets the orange ball.

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

* **Start:** Alice has Moby Dick, Bob has Lolita, Claire has The Great Gatsby, Dave has Catch-22, and Eve has Ulysses.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means they switch books, so we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Lolita
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: The Great Gatsby
    * Eve: Ulysses

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they switch books again, so we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means they switch books, so we have:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they switch books again, so we have:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means they switch books, so we have:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

**Therefore, Bob has Ulysses at the end of the semester.**

**Answer: (E)**

"Eve gets the pink ball!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob and Eve switch partners first, then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then Dave and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners.  

So, the final dance partners are:

* Bob - Claire
* Eve - Ophelia
* Alice - Jamie
* Dave - Rodrigo
* Izzi - Lola 


The answer is **(C) Jamie**. 



"
"The answer is **(C) Izzi**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the steps:

1. **Start:** Dave is with Jamie.
2. **Claire and Alice switch:**  Claire is now with Dave, and Alice is with someone else.
3. **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve is now with Dave, and Alice is with someone else.
4. **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire is now with someone else, and Dave is with someone else.
5. **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave is now with someone else, and Bob is with someone else.
6. **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire is now with someone else, and Alice is with someone else.



 
"
"The answer is **(E) red present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
2. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Dave's.

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the book trades work:

1. **Start:** Dave has Ulysses, Alice has Catch-22, Bob has Moby Dick, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve has The Great Gatsby.

2. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

3. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

5. **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

6. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

**The final answer is (E) Ulysses.** 



"

2. Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets Eve's present and Eve gets Bob's.
3. Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Eve's present and Dave gets Alice's.
4. Bob and Dave swap, so Bob gets Eve's present and Dave gets Bob's.

This means that Bob ends up with Eve's present, which was originally purple. 



"
"The answer is **(E) green ball**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the game involves pairs of players trading balls.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's ball is now Dave's, and Dave's ball is now Claire's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's ball is now Bob's, and Bob's ball is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means Claire's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Claire's.

The final swap is between Bob and Dave.  

**Therefore, the answer is (A) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the book trades work:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: Ulysses
    * Dave: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Bob and Alice Swap:**  This means Bob's book (The Great Gatsby) is now Alice's book (Lolita).
* **Eve and Claire Swap:** This means Eve's book (The Odyssey) is now Claire's book (Ulysses).
* **Alice and Bob Swap:** This means Alice's book (Lolita) is now Bob's book (The Great Gatsby).
* **Dave and Eve Swap:** This means Dave's book (The Fellowship of the Ring) is now Eve's book (The Odyssey).
* **Claire and Eve Swap:** This means Claire's book (Ulysses) is now Eve's book (The Odyssey).

**Therefore, at the end of the semester, Alice has The Great Gatsby.**

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob (white) + Alice (green) =  Alice (green) gets the white present.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice (green) + Eve (yellow) = Eve (yellow) gets the green present.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire (black) + Eve (yellow) = Eve (yellow) gets the black ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice (green) + Dave (orange) = Dave (orange) gets the green present.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob (white) + Eve (yellow) = Eve (yellow) gets the white present.

"Let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Alice starts with The Pearl.**
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Alice and Bob swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Eve and Alice swap books.** This means they both traded books.

**Therefore, Alice has Catch-22 at the end.** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"The final ball Dave ends up with is the brown ball. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Bob is now playing **Goalkeeper**.  

The correct answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The final position Alice ends up in is Center Midfielder!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"The answer is **(B).** 

Here's why:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a brown ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the book trades work:

1. **Start:**  Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Ulysses*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *The Odyssey*.

2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets *Lolita* and Alice gets *The Great Gatsby*.

3. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *The Odyssey*.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets *The Great Gatsby* and Bob gets *Lolita*.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. Eve and Bob switch partners.
2. Dave and Alice switch partners.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners.
4. Eve and Claire switch partners.
5. Alice and Bob switch partners.

Now, let's look at the final dance.  Dave is dancing with **Alice**. 


The answer is **(A) Sam.** 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Claire and Bob switch positions.
2. Dave and Claire switch positions.
3. Alice and Bob switch positions.
4. Eve and Dave switch positions.
5. Alice and Dave switch positions.

This means:

* Claire starts as a fullback, then becomes a midfielder.
* Dave starts as a midfielder, then becomes a benchwarmer.
* Alice starts as a striker, then becomes a fullback.
* Eve starts as a benchwarmer, then becomes a midfielder.

Bob starts as a fullback, then becomes a striker. 


So the answer is **(B) Striker**. 



"
"The answer is **(B) Ulysses**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Initial Ownership:**
   * Alice: The Pearl
   * Bob: Frankenstein
   * Claire: Ulysses
   * Dave: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Eve: Moby Dick

2. **Bob and Dave Swap:**  This leaves Bob with Ulysses and Dave with Frankenstein.
3. **Bob and Claire Swap:** This leaves Bob with Hound of the Baskervilles and Claire with Ulysses.
4. **Dave and Claire Swap:** This leaves Dave with Moby Dick and Claire with Hound of the Baskervilles.
5. **Claire and Bob Swap:** This leaves Claire with Frankenstein and Bob with Moby Dick.
6. **Alice and Eve Swap:** This leaves Alice with Moby Dick and Eve with Frankenstein.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the gifts are swapped in pairs.  Let's see how it changes:

* **Initial:** Alice - Purple, Bob - White, Claire - Yellow, Dave - Pink, Eve - Green
* **Claire and Alice Swap:**  Claire's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Claire.  This changes the state to:
    * Alice: Yellow
    * Claire: Purple
* **Claire and Bob Swap:** Claire's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Claire. This changes the state to:
    * Bob: Yellow
    * Claire: Purple
* **Dave and Alice Swap:** Dave's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Dave. This changes the state to:
    * Alice: Pink
    * Dave: Purple
* **Eve and Dave Swap:** Eve's present goes to Dave, and Dave's present goes to Eve. This changes the state to:
    * Dave: Green
    * Eve: Pink
* **Alice and Bob Swap:** Alice's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Alice. This changes the state to:

"The answer is **(B) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Bob and Eve swap:  Bob starts with an orange ball, Eve starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Eve now has an orange ball and Bob has a brown ball.
2. Eve and Dave swap: Eve now has an orange ball, Dave now has a brown ball.
3. Dave and Alice swap: Dave now has a brown ball, Alice now has a green ball.
4. Alice and Claire swap: Alice now has a green ball, Claire now has a brown ball.
5. Bob and Claire swap: Bob now has a brown ball, Claire now has a green ball.

"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match! 

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:**  We know the initial pairings: Bob with Rodrigo, Claire with Melissa, Dave with Helga, Alice with Lola, and Eve with Jamie.

2. **Dave and Eve switch:**  Dave and Eve switch partners. This means Dave is now with Jamie, and Eve is now with Dave.

3. **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice and Claire switch partners. This means Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Claire is now with Dave.

4. **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave and Bob switch partners. This means Dave is now with Melissa, and Bob is now with Eve.

5. **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice and Eve switch partners. This means Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Eve is now with Dave.

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Melissa.**

"Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring! 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

The final gift Bob has is the color that was in the last swap.  

The last swap was between Bob and Dave.  

So the answer is **(E) green present.** 
"
"Eve has Ulysses at the end of the semester. 

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) Rodrigo**. 

Here's why:

* We know Dave and Bob switch partners, but this doesn't affect who Claire or Eve are dancing with.
* Claire and Dave switch partners, meaning Claire is now dancing with someone other than Dave.
* Eve and Alice switch partners, meaning Eve is now dancing with someone other than Alice.
* Claire and Eve switch partners, meaning Claire is now dancing with someone other than Eve.
* Alice and Eve switch partners, meaning Alice is now dancing with someone other than Eve. 



Let me know if you have any other dance-related questions! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to figure out who has the gift at the end.  Here's how we can do that:

* **Start with the initial gifts:** Alice has purple, Bob has brown, Claire has green, Dave has red, and Eve has pink. 

* **We need to see how the gifts are swapped:**  We know that Bob and Claire swap gifts, Dave and Eve swap gifts, Bob and Alice swap gifts, Eve and Bob swap gifts, and Dave and Bob swap gifts. 

* **The key is to see how the gifts are swapped:**  We need to see how the gifts are swapped to figure out who has what at the end. 

Let me know if you want to try another puzzle! 



 
"
"Eve is dancing with Helga!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Bob swap balls, so Eve gets Bob's blue ball and Bob gets Eve's green ball. 

Then, Dave and Claire swap, so Dave gets Claire's brown ball and Claire gets Dave's red ball.

Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's blue ball and Eve gets Alice's yellow ball.

Finally, Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Alice's yellow ball.

And last, Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Bob's yellow ball.

So, the answer is **(E) blue ball**. 



"
"The answer is **(D) Sam**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:** Claire is with Sam, Dave is with Karl, Alice is with Lola, Bob is with Melissa, and Eve is with Helga.

2. **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave now dances with Lola, Alice now dances with Karl.

3. **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire now dances with Karl, Dave now dances with Helga.

4. **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice now dances with Helga, Dave now dances with Lola.

5. **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob now dances with Melissa, Eve now dances with Sam. 


 
"
"Eve ends up with Rodrigo!  

The answer is **(A) Rodrigo**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes the colors again.

**The final gift Bob has is the (B) black ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(B) purple present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Dave swap:  Alice gets Dave's purple present.
2. Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets Dave's yellow present.
3. Dave and Eve swap: Eve gets Dave's pink present.
4. Bob and Dave swap: Dave gets Bob's green present.
5. Dave and Claire swap: Claire gets Dave's yellow present.

Since Dave ends up with the yellow present, Claire must have the purple present. 



"
"The answer is **(C) brown ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Dave starts with a green ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball. 



Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

**The key is to see that each swap results in a new ball being held by each player.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (E) yellow ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(B) green ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets Green, Claire gets Purple
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets Purple, Bob gets Green
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Green, Bob gets Purple
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Blue, Alice gets Purple 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Eve ends up with *The Great Gatsby*!  

Here's why:

* **Eve starts with *Lolita*.**
* **Alice and Eve swap books.** This means Alice's book is now Eve's.
* **Claire and Eve swap books.** This means Claire's book is now Eve's.

"Eve is dancing with Dave at the end of the dance.  The answer is **(B) Helga.** 
"
"The answer is **(A) orange ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Dave swap, Dave gets the orange ball.
2. Bob and Claire swap, Claire gets the black ball.
3. Claire and Dave swap, Dave gets the pink ball.
4. Dave and Bob swap, Bob gets the orange ball.
5. Alice and Eve swap, Alice gets the red ball. 


Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance moves break down:

1. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
2. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
3. **Alice and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**

Now, let's look at the final dance. Bob is dancing with...

**(A) Ophelia.** 


 
"
"Eve ends up with the red ball!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"The answer is **(E)**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
2. **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes the colors.
3. **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes the colors again.
4. **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes the colors again.
5. **Eve and Dave swap:** This changes the colors again.

The final gift Alice has is the purple present. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with an orange ball, and Alice starts with purple. They swap, so Eve gets the purple and Alice gets the orange ball.
2. **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Bob gets the blue present and Dave gets the brown present.
3. **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so Bob gets the purple present and Alice gets the blue present.
4. **Claire and Eve:** They swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.
5. **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.

**So, Claire ends up with the purple present.**

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is in the center midfield, Bob is a fullback, Claire is the goalkeeper, Dave is a left winger, and Eve is a right winger.

2. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the right winger.

3. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice becomes the left winger, and Dave becomes the center midfielder.

4. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.

5. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, and Alice becomes the right winger.

6. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.

Here's how we can do it:

* **Start with the initial ownership:**  We know who has each book at the beginning. 
* **Then, we need to track the swaps:**  We need to see which books are swapped and who gets which book. 

Let's break it down step by step.

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Claire starts as a right winger.  We know that Bob and Claire switch positions, so Bob becomes the left midfielder and Claire becomes the right winger.  Then, Bob and Fred switch positions, so Bob becomes the center midfielder and Fred becomes the left midfielder.  Then, Gertrude and Alice switch positions, so Gertrude becomes the right winger and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.  Then, Eve and Alice switch positions, so Eve becomes the right winger and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.  Finally, Eve and Dave switch positions, so Eve becomes the center midfielder and Dave becomes the goalkeeper. 

So, Claire is now playing right winger.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:**  Each person has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who ends up with which ball.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

**The key is to see who ends up with the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with them.**

**Final Answer:** Dave ends up with the ball that was originally held by Alice.

"Fred is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"The answer is **(B) Ophelia**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the changes that happen throughout the dance:

1. **Dave and Eve switch partners.**
2. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**
3. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
4. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
5. **Dave and Eve switch partners.**
6. **Bob and Alice switch partners.**
7. **Bob and Gertrude switch partners.**

We can see that the final dance partners are determined by the last two steps. 

Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **Start:** We know Dave has a black ball.
* **Bob and Eve Swap:**  This changes Bob's present to something else, and Eve's present to something else.
* **Claire and Gertrude Swap:** This changes Claire's present to something else, and Gertrude's present to something else.
* **Gertrude and Dave Swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something else, and Dave's present to something else.
* **Eve and Fred Swap:** This changes Eve's present to something else, and Fred's present to something else.
* **Fred and Bob Swap:** This changes Fred's present to something else, and Bob's present to something else.
* **Claire and Alice Swap:** This changes Claire's present to something else, and Alice's present to something else.
* **Fred and Bob Swap:** This changes Fred's present to something else, and Bob's present to something else.

**The key is to note that the gifts are swapped, but the colors don't change.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (F) black ball.** 



"
"Fred is the left midfielder!  

The correct answer is **(F) left midfielder**. 
"
"Claire is now dancing with Jamie!  The answer is (E). 
"
"Gertrude ends up playing center midfielder!  That's the final position she ends up in. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up with the green ball.  

The answer is **(E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the gifts are being swapped, and we need to figure out who ends up with what.  

Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Start:**  We have Alice (blue), Bob (brown), Claire (orange), Dave (red), Eve (black), Fred (purple), and Gertrude (green).

2. **Claire and Gertrude Swap:**  Claire gets green, and Gertrude gets orange.

3. **Fred and Gertrude Swap:** Fred gets orange, and Gertrude gets green.

4. **Gertrude and Eve Swap:** Gertrude gets black, and Eve gets green.

5. **Dave and Eve Swap:** Dave gets green, and Eve gets black.

6. **Dave and Alice Swap:** Dave gets black, and Alice gets green.

7. **Eve and Alice Swap:** Eve gets green, and Alice gets black.

8. **Bob and Dave Swap:** Bob gets green, and Dave gets black.

**So, Bob ends up with the green present!**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Dave and Claire switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Claire and Fred switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Fred and Alice switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.

**The final answer is (E) Melissa.** 



"
"The answer is **(C) purple ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Dave swap, so Fred gets a pink ball and Dave gets a black ball.
2. Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets a blue ball and Claire gets a yellow ball.
3. Dave and Bob swap, so Dave gets a brown ball and Bob gets a pink ball.
4. Claire and Gertrude swap, so Claire gets a blue ball and Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
5. Alice and Fred swap, so Alice gets a black ball and Fred gets a white ball.
6. Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets a pink ball and Alice gets a black ball.
7. Eve and Bob swap, so Eve gets a purple ball and Bob gets a pink ball. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Alice and Bob:**  They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so they both end up with a different book.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

**The answer is (E) Frankenstein.** 



Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **The swaps:**  We need to see how the swaps affect the books. 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Claire's book.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Eve's book.
5. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Fred's book.

"The answer is **(E) blue ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Bob and Gertrude:**  Bob gives his pink ball to Gertrude, who gives her pink ball to Bob.
2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives his green ball to Bob, who gives his pink ball to Dave.
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Gertrude, who gives her yellow ball to Eve.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his pink ball to Alice, who gives her orange ball to Bob.
5. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Fred, who gives his red ball to Eve.
6. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives her brown ball to Dave, who gives his green ball to Claire.

The final ball that Fred holds is the blue ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Dave swap balls, then Eve and Fred swap balls, and then Eve and Dave swap balls again.  This means Eve is getting a new ball each time.  

Let's look at the other swaps:

* Bob and Alice swap balls.
* Gertrude and Claire swap balls.
* Alice and Dave swap balls.

Eve is the only one who gets a new ball each time.  

**The answer is (E) white ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book at the beginning of the semester. 
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are exchanged. 
* **Identify the final book:**  We need to figure out who has the book that Alice ends up with.

"Eve is playing right winger at the end of the match.  The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Gertrude and Eve:**  Gertrude gives Eve her pink ball, and Eve gives Gertrude her red ball.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his purple ball, and Bob gives Fred his black ball.
3. **Fred and Eve:** Fred gives Eve her purple ball, and Eve gives Fred her red ball.
4. **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gives Gertrude her orange ball, and Gertrude gives Alice her pink ball.
5. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gives Gertrude her blue ball.
6. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave her pink ball, and Dave gives Gertrude her brown ball.
7. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gives Bob his orange ball, and Bob gives Alice her black ball. 


Let me know if you'd like to play another game!

"The answer is **(C) blue present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Eve and Fred swap gifts.
2. Dave and Bob swap gifts.
3. Claire and Gertrude swap gifts.
4. Fred and Claire swap gifts.
5. Bob and Fred swap gifts.
6. Gertrude and Alice swap gifts.
7. Bob and Claire swap gifts.

The final swap is between Gertrude and Alice.  Since Gertrude gave Alice her blue present, Alice now has the blue present.

"Eve is dancing with Sam at the end!  

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Eve ends up with the yellow present!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Eve and Claire switch partners.**
2. **Fred and Gertrude switch partners.**
3. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**
4. **Eve and Alice switch partners.**
5. **Dave and Bob switch partners.**
6. **Dave and Eve switch partners.**
7. **Alice and Dave switch partners.**

So, Dave is now dancing with Rodrigo. 


The answer is **(C) Rodrigo**. 



"
"The answer is **(C) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Eve and Dave swap balls.
2. Gertrude and Eve swap balls.
3. Bob and Fred swap balls.
4. Claire and Fred swap balls.
5. Alice and Claire swap balls.
6. Eve and Fred swap balls.
7. Eve and Dave swap balls.

The final ball distribution is:

* Alice: Green ball
* Bob: Brown ball
* Claire: Orange ball
* Dave: Red ball
* Eve: Blue ball
* Fred: Black ball
* Gertrude: Yellow ball 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions! 

Bob started as center midfielder, and then he traded with Eve, so he is now playing striker. 

The answer is **(D) striker**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:**  We know Alice has a green present.
* **Gertrude and Eve:**  They swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Eve's.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Bob's.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Fred's.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's present and Bob gets Dave's.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's present and Alice gets Bob's.
* **Dave and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Dave's present and Dave gets Claire's.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Claire's present and Claire gets Alice's.

**The answer is (E) purple.**

"Fred is playing fullback at the end of the match.  The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  This means Claire gets the orange ball and Gertrude gets the pink ball.
2. **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets the orange ball and Alice gets the pink ball.
3. **Gertrude and Claire swap:**  Gertrude gets the pink ball and Claire gets the orange ball.
4. **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice gets the orange ball and Dave gets the pink ball.
5. **Fred and Dave swap:**  Fred gets the pink ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
6. **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire gets the orange ball and Dave gets the pink ball.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets the orange ball and Eve gets the pink ball.

**Therefore, Fred has the orange ball.** 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to see who ends up with which ball.  

* Eve and Dave swap, so Eve gets Dave's blue ball and Dave gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Fred swap, so Eve gets Fred's white ball and Fred gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Dave swap again, so Eve gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's purple ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's green ball and Alice gets Bob's purple ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's pink ball and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.
* Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Alice's purple ball.

Fred ends up with the white ball! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the answer:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book to start. 
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see who swapped with whom. 
* **The final swap:**  We need to figure out who has the book that was swapped with everyone else.

* **The final book:**  We need to figure out who has the book that was swapped with Bob.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the book at the end:

* **Start:**  We know everyone gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track the swaps to see how the books change hands. 

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Dave and Gertrude swap:** This changes Gertrude's book to Dave's book, and Dave's book to Gertrude's book.
2. **Claire and Bob swap:** This changes Bob's book to Claire's book, and Claire's book to Bob's book.
3. **Alice and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's book to Alice's book, and Alice's book to Dave's book.
4. **Fred and Claire swap:** This changes Claire's book to Fred's book, and Fred's book to Claire's book.
5. **Dave and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's book to Dave's book, and Dave's book to Fred's book.
6. **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes Claire's book to Bob's book, and Bob's book to Claire's book.
7. **Eve and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's book to Eve's book, and Eve's book to Fred's book.

**The Final Book:**

* **Alice** has the book that was originally Dave's book. 



**Answer:** (C) The Pearl 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the colors will change hands:

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap, so Bob now has a green ball, and Alice has a white ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap, so Alice now has a blue ball, and Claire has a purple ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** They swap, so Bob now has a purple ball, and Fred has a white ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Claire now has a white ball, and Fred has a purple ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so Alice now has a red ball, and Gertrude has a purple ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap, so Alice now has a blue ball, and Dave has a red ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Dave now has a red ball, and Eve has a blue ball.

**Therefore, Fred has the orange ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice - Left Midfielder, Bob - Benchwarmer, Claire - Right Midfielder, Dave - Cheerleader, Eve - Left Winger, Fred - Goalkeeper, Gertrude - Right Winger.

* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Left Midfielder.
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes Cheerleader, Dave becomes Goalkeeper.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes Benchwarmer, Bob becomes Left Midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Winger, Eve becomes Right Winger.

**Answer:**  Fred has **(D) The Great Gatsby**. 



"
"Eve is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The answer is **(G) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

6. Gertrude and Bob swap: Gertrude gets Bob's brown ball.
7. Gertrude and Claire swap: Gertrude gets Claire's blue ball.

Eve ends up with the yellow ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve starts with a yellow present.  We know that Eve and Bob swap gifts, and then Dave and Claire swap gifts.  Then Alice and Bob swap gifts.  

We also know that Alice and Gertrude swap gifts.  

Let's think about the final swap. Bob and Eve swap gifts. 

**Answer: (B) orange ball.**

"Alice is playing Left Winger at the end of the match. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Dave starts with Melissa.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners.  Eve and Dave switch partners.  Bob and Alice switch partners.  Bob and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Eve switch partners. 

This means Dave is now with Rodrigo. 

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Red
    * Bob: Orange
    * Claire: Pink
    * Dave: Purple
    * Eve: Brown
    * Fred: Black
    * Gertrude: Green

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire's present becomes Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve's present becomes Gertrude's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice's present becomes Dave's, and vice versa.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Fred's present becomes Alice's, and vice versa.

Let me know if you have any other book-related puzzles! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:**  Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Bob:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
2. **Alice and Dave:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
3. **Gertrude and Fred:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
6. **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
7. **Dave and Eve:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.**

"Fred has The Odyssey. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Fred starts with Lolita.**
2. **Alice and Fred swap:** Fred gives Lolita to Alice, and Alice gets it.
3. **Eve and Fred swap:** Fred gives Ulysses to Eve, and Eve gets it.

Fred's book is the one that was given to him in the first trade. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Bob and Gertrude:**  Bob's purple + Gertrude's pink =  **Bob gets pink, Gertrude gets purple**
2. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude's pink + Dave's orange = **Dave gets pink, Gertrude gets orange**
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's yellow + Gertrude's pink = **Gertrude gets yellow, Eve gets pink**
4. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's purple + Dave's orange = **Dave gets purple, Bob gets orange**
5. **Claire and Dave:** Claire's white + Dave's orange = **Dave gets white, Claire gets orange**

"Eve ends up with the blue present! 

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out Claire's book:

* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Gertrude's book.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

**The key is to see how the books are swapped.**  Claire's book changes hands multiple times. 

**The answer:**

* **The only book that Claire ends up with is The Great Gatsby.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (A).**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Dave and Bob switch partners.**
2. **Eve and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Claire and Gertrude switch partners.**
4. **Alice and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
6. **Eve and Fred switch partners.**

"Eve ends up with the green present!  

The answer is **(E) green present**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Claire swapped balls first, so Eve now has a pink ball. Then Bob and Eve swapped, so Bob now has a pink ball.  Claire and Alice swapped, so Claire now has a white ball.  Then Bob and Alice swapped, so Bob now has a white ball.  Dave and Eve swapped, so Dave now has a purple ball.  Finally, Fred and Gertrude swapped, so Fred now has a green ball.  

The last swap was between Gertrude and Claire, so Gertrude now has a pink ball. 

**Therefore, Bob has the green ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball trading works:

1. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her white ball, Dave gives Eve her pink ball.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives Eve her purple ball, Eve gives Claire her white ball.
3. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her pink ball, Claire gives Dave her purple ball.
4. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, Fred gives Bob his red ball.
5. **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his red ball, Dave gives Fred his pink ball.
6. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her white ball, Alice gives Eve her green ball.
7. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude her pink ball, Gertrude gives Dave her orange ball.

**Final Ball:** Fred has the **white ball**. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Gertrude starts with a black ball.  We know that Fred and Eve swap gifts, and then Fred and Alice swap gifts.  We also know that Fred and Dave swap gifts.  

The final gift Gertrude has is the **black ball**. 


**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
2. **Claire and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
3. **Eve and Alice:** Swap, so Eve gets a blue ball and Alice gets a white ball.
4. **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
5. **Alice and Dave:** Swap, so Alice gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
6. **Fred and Dave:** Swap, so Fred gets a pink ball and Dave gets a black ball.
7. **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so Claire gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
8. **Bob and Eve:** Swap, so Bob gets a pink ball and Eve gets a black ball.

**Therefore, Bob has the yellow ball.** 



 
"
"Eve ends up with *The Fellowship of the Ring*. 

The correct answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Alice starts with Melissa, but then Dave and Alice switch partners.  Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  After that, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners.  Finally, Dave and Gertrude switch partners.  

So, the final answer is **(A) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives up her blue ball to Alice.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives up his green ball to Bob.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives up his green ball to Claire.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives up her brown ball to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Eve.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives up her orange ball to Fred.

**Fred ends up with the green ball.** 


**So the answer is (E).** 



"
"The final ball Alice has is the purple ball. 

The answer is **(C)**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has what:

* **Fred and Gertrude:**  They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Fred's.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap, so Fred gets Eve's present and Eve gets Fred's.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Claire gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Claire's.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Dave gets Eve's present and Eve gets Dave's.
* **Alice and Fred:** They swap, so Alice gets Fred's present and Fred gets Alice's.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Alice gets Bob's present and Bob gets Alice's.

**Therefore, the answer is (F) red present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial distribution:**  Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *Lolita*, and so on. 
* **We need to track the swaps:**  Alice and Eve swap books, then Bob and Alice swap, and so on. 
* **The key is to keep track of who gets which book after each swap.**

Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the swaps step-by-step! 


"
"Let's break down the process of how to solve this problem. 

**Understanding the Problem**

The problem asks us to determine the final ownership of each book after a series of book swaps. 

**Here's a breakdown of the solution process:

1. **Initial Ownership:**

* Alice: The Great Gatsby
* Bob: Lolita
* Claire: Hound of the Baskervilles
* Dave: Moby Dick
* Eve: Ulysses
* Fred: Frankenstein
* Gertrude: The Fellowship of the Ring

**2.  The Swaps:**

* Gertrude and Dave swap:  This changes Dave's book to Gertrude's, and Dave's book to Gertrude's.
* Fred and Eve swap: This changes Eve's book to Fred's.
* Gertrude and Bob swap: This changes Bob's book to Gertrude's.
* Claire and Alice swap: This changes Alice's book to Claire's.
* Eve and Claire swap: This changes Claire's book to Eve's.
* Eve and Bob swap: This changes Bob's book to Eve's. 
* Eve and Bob swap: This changes Bob's book to Eve's. 

**3. Final Ownership:**

* Alice: The Great Gatsby
* Bob: Lolita
* Claire: Hound of the Baskervilles
* Dave: Moby Dick
* Eve: Ulysses
* Fred: Frankenstein
* Gertrude: The Fellowship of the Ring

"The answer is **(G) white ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's ball.
2. Fred and Alice swap, so Alice gets Fred's ball.
3. Alice and Claire swap, so Claire gets Alice's ball.
4. Bob and Dave swap, so Dave gets Bob's ball.
5. Fred and Eve swap, so Eve gets Fred's ball.
6. Gertrude and Fred swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's ball.
7. Gertrude and Bob swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's ball. 


Bob now has the white ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has what at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: White
    * Bob: Black
    * Claire: Pink
    * Dave: Orange
    * Eve: Purple
    * Fred: Yellow
    * Gertrude: Blue

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This changes Dave's present to something Fred has, and Fred's present to something Dave has. 
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes Bob's present to something Fred has, and Fred's present to something Bob has.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something Dave has, and Dave's present to something Gertrude has.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Claire has, and Claire's present to something Dave has.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Eve has, and Eve's present to something Dave has.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This changes Claire's present to something Bob has, and Bob's present to something Claire has.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Alice has, and Alice's present to something Dave has.

**The final gift Gertrude has is the one that was originally Fred's.** 

**The answer is (F) blue present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred ends up with the black ball because of the following sequence of swaps:

1. Eve and Gertrude swap balls.
2. Fred and Bob swap balls.
3. Fred and Claire swap balls.
4. Eve and Fred swap balls.
5. Fred and Claire swap balls.
6. Alice and Bob swap balls.
7. Dave and Gertrude swap balls.

Let me know if you'd like to play another game! 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out Fred's present:

* **Start with the initial colors:**  We know Fred has a yellow present.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We see that Fred swapped with Alice and then with Dave. 
* **Consider the swaps:**  We also know that Eve's present is black. 

**Therefore, Fred's present is the one that was originally Claire's.** 

The answer is **(B) pink ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the gifts are being swapped in pairs.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave's present is now Fred's, and Fred's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Alice's.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Alice's.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Fred's.

The final gift is the one that was originally Fred's. 

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"The answer is **(C) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps and who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve starts with a white ball and Gertrude starts with a blue ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Bob has a purple ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob now has a purple ball, and Dave has a pink ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred now has a brown ball, and Claire has a black ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Gertrude has a white ball.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Alice now has an orange ball, and Fred has a brown ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Dave now has a pink ball, and Eve has a blue ball.

"The answer is **(C) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and how they affect the books each person has.  

* **Initial:**  Everyone starts with a new book.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This changes the books Bob and Fred have.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes the books Dave and Alice have.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** This changes the books Gertrude and Claire have.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes the books Bob and Claire have.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This changes the books Alice and Claire have.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes the books Eve and Alice have.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes the books Alice and Gertrude have.

After all these swaps, Claire ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:**  Bob is right midfielder, Claire is striker, Dave is fullback, Eve is center midfielder, Fred is benchwarmer, and Gertrude is right winger.

2. **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes right winger, Bob becomes right midfielder.

3. **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes striker, Claire becomes center midfielder.

4. **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes fullback, Dave becomes striker.

5. **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes fullback, Dave becomes center midfielder.

6. **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes right winger, Alice becomes striker.

7. **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes right midfielder, Bob becomes fullback.

8. **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes striker, Alice becomes right winger.

**Final Positions:**

* **Bob:** Bob starts as right midfielder, and after all the trades, he ends up as **(F) right midfielder**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final book Dave has:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know everyone starts with a new book.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see which books are swapped and who gets them. 
* **The key is to follow the swaps:**  We need to see who swaps with whom. 

Let's break it down step by step. 

**Dave's final book is (A) Hound of the Baskervilles.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Alice and Fred switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Gertrude and Eve switch partners.
* Gertrude and Bob switch partners.
* Claire and Bob switch partners.
* Fred and Dave switch partners.
* Alice and Bob switch partners.

    * Bob: Orange
    * Claire: Black
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Red
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Pink

* **Fred and Eve Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Fred and Eve now have each other's gifts.

* **Bob and Gertrude Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Bob and Gertrude now have each other's gifts.

* **Alice and Claire Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Claire now have each other's gifts.

* **Dave and Fred Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Fred now have each other's gifts.

* **Dave and Eve Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Eve now have each other's gifts.

* **Alice and Eve Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Eve now have each other's gifts.

**The key is that we don't know what was swapped in each pair.  We can only know that the gifts were swapped.**

    * Fred: White
    * Bob: Yellow
    * Claire: Black
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Purple
    * Alice: Red
    * Gertrude: Brown

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This changes Gertrude's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Claire's.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes Eve's present to Claire's, and Claire's present to Eve's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Gertrude's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to Bob's, and Bob's present to Fred's.

**The answer is (E) yellow.**

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:** Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **The swaps:** We need to track who gets which book after each swap.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Alice and Claire:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Claire starts with Lolita.
2. **Bob and Dave:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Dave and Fred:** Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.
4. **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with The Pearl, Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.
5. **Alice and Dave:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
6. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby, Gertrude starts with Frankenstein.
7. **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The Final Swap:** Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring. 

**Therefore, the answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, so let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how the books are distributed:

* **Start:** Alice: Ulysses, Bob: The Odyssey, Claire: Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave: Moby Dick, Eve: Frankenstein, Fred: The Pearl, Gertrude: Lolita.

* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets Lolita, Gertrude gets Ulysses.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets The Pearl, Fred gets Moby Dick.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Claire gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Ulysses, Claire gets Frankenstein.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets Frankenstein, Alice gets The Pearl.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Moby Dick, Dave gets The Pearl.

**Final Answer:** Claire has **(A) Hound of the Baskervilles**.

"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as the cheerleader.  Then Bob and Alice switch positions.  Then Claire and Fred switch positions.  Gertrude and Fred switch positions.  Eve and Fred switch positions.  Alice and Gertrude switch positions.  Gertrude and Dave switch positions.  Finally, Bob and Dave switch positions. 

So, the final position for Alice is fullback. 


**Answer:** (F) fullback 
"
"The answer is **(E) Moby Dick**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Initial Purchases:** Each person gets a new book.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap books.
3. **Eve and Dave:** Swap books.
4. **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap books.
5. **Eve and Alice:** Swap books.
6. **Fred and Eve:** Swap books.
7. **Alice and Bob:** Swap books.
8. **Claire and Alice:** Swap books.

Alice's book is the one that is swapped the most.

"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Dave and Fred swap:**  Dave gets Fred's ball, and Fred gets Dave's ball.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Claire's ball.
3. **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's ball, and Bob gets Eve's ball.
4. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Gertrude's ball.
5. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets Gertrude's ball, and Gertrude gets Alice's ball.
6. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Bob's ball.
7. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Bob's ball.

**The final ball that Dave has is the ball that was originally Bob's ball.** 

**The answer is (C) blue ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Trades:**  We need to see how the colors change hands.

Let's look at the trades:

1. **Alice-Fred:** Alice gives Fred her blue ball, Fred gets Alice's blue ball.
2. **Dave-Fred:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
3. **Eve-Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
4. **Dave-Claire:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
5. **Claire-Bob:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.

"Fred ends up with Ulysses!  

The correct answer is **(F) Ulysses**. 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives up her blue ball to Alice.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives up his green ball to Bob.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives up his green ball to Claire.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives up her brown ball to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Eve.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives up her orange ball to Fred.

**So, the answer is (B) pink ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Bob starts as a cheerleader, and then he and Claire switch positions.  Then, Bob and Fred switch positions again.  After that, Gertrude and Alice switch positions.  Then, Eve and Alice switch positions.  Finally, Eve and Dave switch positions. 

Bob ends up playing **center midfielder**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**
2. **Gertrude and Bob switch partners.**
3. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
4. **Eve and Dave switch partners.**
5. **Bob and Gertrude switch partners.**
6. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
7. **Dave and Fred switch partners.**

Now, let's see who Alice is dancing with at the end! 


**The answer is (F) Sam.** 



"
"The answer is **(G) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Fred swap.
2. Claire and Eve swap.
3. Dave and Gertrude swap.
4. Eve and Dave swap.
5. Dave and Fred swap.
6. Fred and Claire swap.
7. Claire and Bob swap.

The final ball that Alice holds is the green ball.

"Gertrude is dancing with Dave!  

The answer is (C).

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to figure out what gifts Dave ends up with.  To do that, we need to know what happened in each swap.  

Here's what we know:

* **Fred and Eve:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Alice and Bob:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Alice and Dave:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Fred and Alice:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Eve and Alice:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Fred and Claire:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

**To figure out what Dave has, we need to know what happened in each swap.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who gets which ball after each swap.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Dave:**  Claire's ball is swapped with Dave's.
2. **Fred and Eve:** Fred's ball is swapped with Eve's.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob's ball is swapped with Claire's.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Eve's ball is swapped with Alice's.
5. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's ball is swapped with Gertrude's.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's ball is swapped with Dave's.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude's ball is swapped with Bob's.

**The final ball that Gertrude has is the pink ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Blue
    * Claire: Orange
    * Dave: Yellow
    * Eve: White
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Red

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This changes Eve's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Eve's.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes Bob's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Bob's.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Alice's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Alice's.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This changes Claire's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Claire's.

**The answer is (E) pink ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(D) brown present**. 

Here's why:

The gifts are swapped in a way that doesn't change the color of the gifts. 

Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob starts as a right winger.  Here's how the positions change:

1. Alice and Gertrude switch positions.
2. Dave and Claire switch positions.
3. Bob and Fred switch positions.
4. Fred and Alice switch positions.
5. Gertrude and Fred switch positions.
6. Dave and Bob switch positions.
7. Claire and Eve switch positions.

So, Bob ends up as the **Fullback**.

"Eve gets the green ball!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Gertrude starts as the benchwarmer, and we know she's going to be playing a different position by the end.  Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Fullback, Fred becomes Goalkeeper
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Fullback
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Benchwarmer
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Goalkeeper
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Right Winger, Bob becomes Center Midfielder

**Final Positions:**

* **Gertrude:** Left Midfielder
* **Alice:** Goalkeeper
* **Bob:** Center Midfielder
* **Claire:** Right Winger
* **Dave:** Fullback
* **Eve:** Center Midfielder
* **Fred:** Right Winger 


**Answer:** (A) Left Midfielder 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred's present is the **black ball**.  

Here's why:

* The swaps only involve pairs of people. 
* Fred's present doesn't change throughout the swaps. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has which book at the end, we need to follow the order of the swaps.  

* **Alice and Bob:**  Alice starts with Moby Dick, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave starts with The Pearl, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Moby Dick, Eve starts with Ulysses.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Catch-22, Dave starts with The Pearl.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Pearl.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.

**The answer is (B) The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Start:** Everyone has a ball.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a brown ball, Gertrude gets a white ball.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets a yellow ball, Claire gets a pink ball.
4. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gets a yellow ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
5. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a pink ball, Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets a pink ball, Claire gets a green ball.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets a green ball, Claire gets a brown ball.
8. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets a brown ball, Claire gets an orange ball.

**So, who has the white ball?**

* (B) white ball 


Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they both have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve and Alice have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice and Fred have a book they didn't originally get.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at the end of the semester.**

"Fred ends up with Catch-22.  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"The answer is **(F) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Fred swap.
2. Gertrude and Fred swap.
3. Bob and Dave swap.
4. Alice and Bob swap.
5. Claire and Fred swap.
6. Claire and Gertrude swap.
7. Alice and Eve swap.

Notice that the ball that Bob ends up with is the one that was originally held by Alice.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

1. Alice and Bob switch partners.
2. Eve and Gertrude switch partners.
3. Claire and Gertrude switch partners.
4. Gertrude and Bob switch partners.
5. Claire and Bob switch partners.
6. Fred and Gertrude switch partners.
7. Claire and Dave switch partners.

Now, let's see who Alice ends up with.  

**Answer: (F) Karl** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire is with Melissa to start.  Then, Fred and Eve switch partners.  Bob and Dave switch partners.  Eve and Alice switch partners.  Bob and Claire switch partners.  Eve and Alice switch partners.  Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Dave switch partners. 

So, the final dance partners are:

* **Fred** is with Karl
* **Eve** is with Karl
* **Bob** is with Ophelia
* **Dave** is with Karl
* **Claire** is with **Karl**


The answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Bob is dancing with Lola!  The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred and Gertrude switch partners first, so Fred is now dancing with Lola.  Then Dave and Claire switch partners, so Dave is now dancing with Sam.  

We need to keep track of who is dancing with whom.  

* Fred and Gertrude switch partners.
* Dave and Claire switch partners.
* Dave and Bob switch partners.
* Bob and Claire switch partners.
* Alice and Gertrude switch partners.
* Dave and Alice switch partners.
* Eve and Gertrude switch partners.

Fred is now dancing with Karl. 


The answer is **(F)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know that each person starts with a book.  Then, they trade books with each other.  We need to figure out what book Gertrude ends up with. 

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Lolita, Eve starts with Catch-22.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with Catch-22, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.

**The key is to understand that the swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

**Therefore, the answer is (F) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to figure out who has what at the end.  We know that the gifts are swapped, but we don't know what was swapped.  

Here's what we know:

* **Alice:**  We don't know what she has.
* **Bob:**  We don't know what he has.
* **Claire:**  We don't know what she has.
* **Dave:**  We don't know what he has.
* **Eve:**  We don't know what she has.
* **Fred:**  We don't know what he has.
* **Gertrude:**  We don't know what she has.

**So, we can't determine who has what.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Gertrude ends up with The Odyssey because of the final swap.  

The answer is **(E) The Odyssey**. 


"
"The answer is **(C) brown ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Fred and Bob swap.
2. Eve and Fred swap.
3. Dave and Eve swap.
4. Alice and Bob swap.
5. Dave and Fred swap.
6. Bob and Claire swap.
7. Gertrude and Alice swap.

Notice that the ball that Alice ends up with is the one that was originally held by Gertrude. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Dave starts as the goalkeeper.  We know Bob and Fred swap positions, then Bob and Dave swap again.  Then Gertrude and Eve swap positions.  Bob and Dave swap again.  Gertrude and Dave swap again.  Eve and Alice swap positions.  Finally, Alice and Claire swap positions. 

This means Dave ends up playing center midfielder! 

The answer is **(B) center midfielder**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  We need to think about how the gifts are swapped.  

Here's what we know:

* **We start with:** Alice (blue), Bob (black), Claire (purple), Dave (pink), Eve (green), Fred (orange), and Gertrude (yellow).

* **The swaps happen in pairs:**  Each pair of people swaps gifts.

* **We don't know the final outcome:**  We need to figure out who has what after all the swaps.

"Gertrude is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

The answer is (E). 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Fred and Gertrude switch positions. Fred becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes left winger.
2. Dave and Gertrude switch positions. Dave becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes right midfielder.
3. Gertrude and Fred switch positions. Gertrude becomes left winger, Fred becomes fullback.
4. Alice and Bob switch positions. Alice becomes cheerleader, Bob becomes left midfielder.
5. Claire and Dave switch positions. Claire becomes right midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
6. Eve and Claire switch positions. Eve becomes right winger, Claire becomes striker.
7. Alice and Gertrude switch positions. Alice becomes right winger, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.

Now, let's see where Dave ends up:

* Dave started as right midfielder and then traded with Gertrude, so he ends up as **right winger**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
2. **Alice and Fred switch partners.**
3. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**
5. **Eve and Fred switch partners.**
6. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
7. **Fred and Gertrude switch partners.**

Now, let's see who is left with whom at the end.  

**Bob is dancing with Izzi.**

"The answer is **(D) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap again, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap again, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.

Gertrude ends up with the ball that was originally Claire's ball.

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Start:** Each person has a unique color ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.

**The answer is (B) green ball.**

"Bob is the goalkeeper!  He started as the goalkeeper and then Fred and Bob switched positions. 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We have a bunch of colors and a few people. 
* **Swapping:**  We know that people swap gifts, so we need to figure out what happens to the colors. 
* **The Goal:** We want to know what Gertrude has at the end.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Fred swap.
2. Claire and Bob swap.
3. Dave and Fred swap.
4. Eve and Alice swap.
5. Bob and Alice swap.
6. Eve and Gertrude swap.
7. Fred and Alice swap.

**The key is to remember that the colors are being swapped, not the gifts themselves.** 

**The answer is (A) white present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Fred starts with Sam.  Then, Claire and Fred switch partners.  Then, Dave and Claire switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.  Then, Dave and Claire switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Eve switch partners. 

So, Fred is now dancing with Sam. 


The answer is **(F)**.

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change the ownership of either book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

**Dave's book at the end:**

* Dave started with The Odyssey.
* Claire and Dave swapped books, so Dave now has the book Claire had. 

**Therefore, the answer is (G) The Odyssey.**

* **Bob:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby. He trades with Claire, so he ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Claire:** Claire starts with The Fellowship of the Ring. She trades with Dave, so she ends up with The Pearl.
* **Dave:** Dave starts with The Pearl. He trades with Bob, so he ends up with The Great Gatsby.
* **Eve:** Eve starts with Hound of the Baskervilles. She trades with Fred, so she ends up with Lolita.
* **Fred:** Fred starts with Lolita. He trades with Eve, so he ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude starts with Catch-22. She trades with Fred, so she ends up with Lolita.

**Therefore, the answer is (D) The Pearl.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book to begin with. 
* **Look for patterns:**  We need to see who traded with whom. 
* **The key is to track the books:**  We need to figure out which book Dave ends up with. 

Let's see...

* **Dave traded with:** Alice, Claire, Bob, and Eve.

1. Fred and Gertrude swap.
2. Gertrude and Bob swap.
3. Fred and Claire swap.
4. Claire and Dave swap.
5. Claire and Eve swap.
6. Alice and Bob swap.
7. Claire and Eve swap.

Notice that the ball that was originally Claire's ball is the one that ends up with Dave.

"Eve is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the game involves trading balls.  Let's see who ends up with what ball. 

* **Dave and Alice:** Dave starts with a green ball, Alice starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Alice gets the green ball.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice now has the pink ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the pink ball and Alice gets the black ball.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred now has the pink ball, Dave has the black ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Fred gets the black ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve now has the blue ball, Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Eve gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire now has the white ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the white ball and Claire gets the black ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob now has the orange ball, Gertrude has the yellow ball. They swap, so Gertrude gets the orange ball and Bob gets the yellow ball.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude now has the yellow ball, Alice has the black ball. They swap, so Alice gets the yellow ball and Gertrude gets the black ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the white ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  They swap, so Gertrude starts with Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve and Bob swap, so Eve now has Bob's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap, so Dave now has Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred and Claire swap, so Claire now has Fred's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** Claire and Alice swap, so Alice now has Claire's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap again, so Bob now has Dave's book.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve and Fred swap, so Fred now has Eve's book.

**The key is to remember who has which book at the end.**

**Therefore, the answer is (B) Catch-22.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave ends up with the green present.  

The answer is **(F) green present.** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out Fred's book! 

Here's how we can break it down:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who swaps with whom. 

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gives up Ulysses, Gertrude gets it.
2. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives up Moby Dick, Fred gets it.
3. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up Ulysses, Claire gets it.
4. **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives up Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob gets it.
5. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives up Frankenstein, Claire gets it.
6. **Fred and Alice:** Fred gives up The Pearl, Alice gets it.
7. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives up Moby Dick, Dave gets it.

**Final Book:** Fred ends up with **Moby Dick** (from Dave). 


**Answer:** (D)

"The answer is **(A) blue ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Eve and Gertrude swap: Eve gets a black ball, Gertrude gets a blue ball.
2. Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets an orange ball, Bob gets a yellow ball.
3. Fred and Claire swap: Fred gets a white ball, Claire gets a yellow ball.
4. Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets a yellow ball, Fred gets a blue ball.
5. Fred and Claire swap: Fred gets a white ball, Claire gets a blue ball.
6. Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets an orange ball, Bob gets a green ball.
7. Dave and Gertrude swap: Dave gets a pink ball, Gertrude gets a black ball. 


Eve is the only one who has a blue ball at the end.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Fred and Alice:**  Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Eve starts with Frankenstein.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Moby Dick, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.**  

**The answer is (E) The Odyssey.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know that Fred and Alice switched partners, and then Gertrude and Dave switched partners.  This means Fred is now dancing with the person who was originally dancing with Alice. 

So the answer is **(D) Melissa**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to figure out who has which book at the end.  

Here's how we can do it:

* **Start with the initial list:** Alice has Ulysses, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has The Odyssey, Dave has Catch-22, Eve has Lolita, Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Gertrude has Moby Dick.

* **Look at the swaps:** We need to see which books were swapped and who swapped them. 

* **Think about the order:**  We need to figure out the order of the swaps to figure out who has which book at the end. 

Let me know if you want to try another example!

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with the ball:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order. 

**Let's look at the swaps:**

1. **Claire and Bob:** Claire's yellow ball and Bob's green ball are swapped.
2. **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice's blue ball and Gertrude's purple ball are swapped.
3. **Claire and Dave:** Claire's yellow ball and Dave's black ball are swapped.
4. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave's black ball and Gertrude's purple ball are swapped.
5. **Eve and Fred:** Eve's red ball and Fred's orange ball are swapped.
6. **Bob and Eve:** Bob's green ball and Eve's red ball are swapped.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude's purple ball and Claire's yellow ball are swapped.

**The Final Ball:**  

* **Fred** is the only one who doesn't swap with anyone in the last round. 

**Therefore, Fred ends up with the purple ball.**

**Answer: (G)**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:** Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **The swaps:** We need to see how the books are exchanged.

**Let's break down the swaps:**

1. **Claire and Gertrude:** Swap books.
2. **Fred and Dave:** Swap books.
3. **Bob and Alice:** Swap books.
4. **Eve and Gertrude:** Swap books.
5. **Dave and Bob:** Swap books.
6. **Fred and Eve:** Swap books.
7. **Bob and Fred:** Swap books.

**Now, let's think about who has which book at the end.**

Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring. 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"The answer is **(A) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Dave and Bob swap, so Dave gets a purple ball and Bob gets an orange ball.
2. Alice and Gertrude swap, so Alice gets a blue ball and Gertrude gets a white ball.
3. Gertrude and Eve swap, so Gertrude gets a black ball and Eve gets a white ball.
4. Claire and Eve swap, so Claire gets a black ball and Eve gets a white ball.
5. Eve and Fred swap, so Eve gets a pink ball and Fred gets a black ball.
6. Eve and Claire swap, so Eve gets a pink ball and Claire gets a black ball.
7. Dave and Fred swap, so Dave gets a pink ball and Fred gets a black ball. 


Fred ends up with the black ball.

**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Eve gets the pink ball!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Claire starts as a benchwarmer, then Eve and Claire switch positions.  Then, Claire and Dave switch positions.  Dave and Bob switch positions. Fred and Gertrude switch positions. Bob and Claire switch positions again. Dave and Alice switch positions. Finally, Claire and Eve switch positions. 

So, Claire ends up playing **(G) left midfielder**. 



"
"The final position Alice ends up in is **(C) goalkeeper**.  

Here's why:

* The positions are swapped throughout the game, and we know Alice ends up in a new position. 
* The final swap is Bob and Alice. 
* Bob becomes Left Winger, and Alice becomes Goalkeeper.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred starts with Frankenstein, and then he and Dave swap books.  This means Fred now has Dave's book.  

Alice and Claire swap books, so Alice now has Claire's book.

Eve and Dave swap books, so Eve now has Dave's book.

Bob and Eve swap books, so Bob now has Eve's book.

Gertrude and Claire swap books, so Gertrude now has Claire's book.

Eve and Gertrude swap books, so Eve now has Gertrude's book.

Dave and Bob swap books, so Dave now has Bob's book.

**Therefore, Fred's book at the end of the semester is Frankenstein.** 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Claire starts as the striker.  Then, Fred and Claire switch positions.  Dave and Gertrude switch positions, and Alice and Eve switch positions.  Fred and Bob switch positions, and Claire and Gertrude switch positions.  Fred and Dave switch positions, and Eve and Claire switch positions.  

So, at the end of the match, Claire is playing **Center Midfielder**. 


**The answer is (F).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap books.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Eve:** Swap books.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Swap books.

**The key is to track the books as they are traded.**  

Let's analyze the swaps to see where Alice ends up:

* **Alice's book:** Alice starts with ""The Pearl"".
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob now has ""The Pearl"" and Alice has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has ""The Pearl"" and Bob has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Fred and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Fred has ""The Pearl"".
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Claire now has ""The Pearl"" and Fred has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Dave has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Bob has ""The Pearl"".
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Gertrude has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".

**Therefore, Alice ends up with ""The Great Gatsby"".**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave starts with Patrick.  Then Eve and Dave switch partners.  Fred and Eve switch partners.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Dave and Bob switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Bob and Claire switch partners. 

So, Dave is now dancing with Bob. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

We know that the gifts are swapped in a round-robin fashion.  This means that each person gets to swap with everyone else.  

* **Fred and Alice:** Fred's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is Fred's.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is Gertrude's.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Eve's.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Dave's.

The final gift Gertrude has is the one she received from Alice, which is the white present.

**Answer: (G) white present** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Eve ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles.  

Here's how we know:

* **The key is to follow the book swaps.**  We need to see how the ownership of each book changes. 

Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 
"
"Okay, so let's break down the dance swaps! 

* **Start:** Dave is with Sam.
* **Fred and Eve switch:** Fred now dances with Ophelia, Eve now dances with Karl.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob is now with Claire, Dave is now with Ophelia.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve is now with Karl, Alice is now with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with Melissa, Claire is now with Ophelia.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve is now with Karl, Alice is now with Sam.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude is now with Sam, Fred is now with Karl.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob is now with Melissa, Dave is now with Sam.

**So, Dave is now dancing with Sam.** 

The answer is (A).

"Gertrude is dancing with Jamie! 

The answer is **(A)**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Start:** Bob has a black ball, Alice has a white present, and so on.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets a white present, Alice gets a black ball.
3. **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets a green present, Fred gets a blue present.
4. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets a purple present, Gertrude gets a white present.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets an orange ball, Eve gets a white present.
6. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets a brown present, Claire gets a black ball.
7. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets a blue present, Bob gets a green present.
8. **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets an orange ball, Eve gets a green present.

**Therefore, Bob's final gift is the blue present.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball trading works:

1. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her blue ball, Dave gives Eve her red ball.
2. **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gives Eve her yellow ball, Eve gives Gertrude her blue ball.
3. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, Fred gives Bob his black ball.
4. **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his orange ball, Fred gives Claire her black ball.
5. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her green ball, Claire gives Alice her orange ball.
6. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives Fred his blue ball, Fred gives Eve her black ball.
7. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave his blue ball, Dave gives Eve her red ball.

**Final Ball:** Fred ends up with the **black ball**.

"Bob is playing Center Midfielder at the end of the match. 

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has the book Alice had at the start:

* **Initial Ownership:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Claire: The Great Gatsby
    * Dave: Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Eve: Frankenstein
    * Fred: Moby Dick
    * Gertrude: Ulysses

* **Swaps:**
    * Eve and Fred swap:  Eve gets Fred's book, Fred gets Eve's book.
    * Claire and Bob swap:  Claire gets Bob's book, Bob gets Claire's book.
    * Fred and Eve swap:  Fred gets Eve's book, Eve gets Fred's book.
    * Gertrude and Alice swap:  Gertrude gets Alice's book, Alice gets Gertrude's book.
    * Fred and Dave swap:  Fred gets Dave's book, Dave gets Fred's book.
    * Gertrude and Eve swap:  Gertrude gets Eve's book, Eve gets Gertrude's book.
    * Dave and Fred swap:  Dave gets Fred's book, Fred gets Dave's book.

* **Final Ownership:**  We need to figure out who has the book Alice had at the start. 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.**

"Fred is the right winger!  

Here's why:

* Fred started as the goalkeeper.
* Fred and Eve switched positions, and Eve became the goalkeeper.
* Fred and Bob switched positions, and Bob became the goalkeeper.
* Fred and Gertrude switched positions, and Gertrude became the goalkeeper.
* Alice and Eve switched positions, and Eve became the striker.
* Eve and Dave switched positions, and Dave became the fullback.
* Bob and Alice switched positions, and Bob became the left winger. 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as a left midfielder.  Here's what we know:

* Fred and Gertrude switch positions. Fred becomes a left winger, and Gertrude becomes a fullback.
* Dave and Gertrude switch positions. Dave becomes a fullback, and Gertrude becomes a right winger.
* Gertrude and Fred switch positions again. Gertrude becomes a left winger, and Fred becomes a fullback.
* Alice and Bob switch positions. Alice becomes a cheerleader, and Bob becomes a left winger.
* Claire and Dave switch positions. Claire becomes a right winger, and Dave becomes a left winger.
* Eve and Claire switch positions. Eve becomes a right winger, and Claire becomes a left winger.
* Finally, Alice and Gertrude switch positions. Alice becomes a fullback, and Gertrude becomes a left winger.

So, Alice is now playing fullback! 


**Answer: (B) fullback** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book to start. 
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see who swapped with whom. 
* **The final swap:**  The last swap is the key to figuring out who has what. 

Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 


"
"The answer is **(A) white present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets red, Eve gets white.
2. Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets orange, Gertrude gets pink.
3. Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets black, Dave gets orange.
4. Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets brown, Fred gets red.
5. Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets pink, Bob gets white.
6. Claire and Alice swap: Claire gets brown, Alice gets pink.
7. Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets pink, Bob gets white.

Bob started with a white present. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Purple
    * Bob: Brown
    * Claire: Red
    * Dave: Green
    * Eve: Black
    * Fred: Yellow
    * Gertrude: White

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This changes Eve's present to something Dave had.
* **Fred and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Fred had.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's present to something Claire had.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something Dave had.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's present to something Bob had.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to something Fred had.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes Bob's present to something Alice had.

**The final answer is (E) brown present.**

"The answer is **(G) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see how the books end up:

* **Initial:**  Everyone starts with a new book.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets The Pearl, Bob gets Lolita.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets Lolita, Claire gets Catch-22.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred gets Moby Dick.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets The Odyssey, Eve gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Moby Dick, Dave gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets The Odyssey, Eve gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave gets Moby Dick.

After all the swaps, Gertrude ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We have a bunch of colors and a white elephant gift exchange. 
* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap gifts.
* **Claire and Dave:** They also swap gifts.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** They swap gifts.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** They swap gifts.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap gifts.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap gifts.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** They swap gifts.

**The final gift exchange is a bit tricky, but we can figure it out!**

**The answer is (E) black ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve his ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Claire her ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Dave his ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Bob his ball.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his ball, and Dave gives Fred his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Dave his ball.

**Answer:** The final ball distribution is a cycle.  The final ball distribution is:

* **Eve:** White ball
* **Dave:** Pink ball
* **Claire:** Purple ball
* **Bob:** Brown ball
* **Fred:** Red ball
* **Gertrude:** Orange ball
* **Alice:** Green ball

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire ends up with the brown present. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is right winger, Dave is striker, Eve is center midfielder, Fred is fullback, Gertrude is benchwarmer, Alice is left midfielder, and Bob is cheerleader.

* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes left midfielder, Alice becomes benchwarmer.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes left midfielder, Gertrude becomes striker.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes striker, Gertrude becomes left midfielder.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes fullback, Claire becomes center midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes fullback, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes center midfielder.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes left midfielder, Alice becomes fullback.

**Final Position:** Claire is now playing **center midfielder**.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to figure out who has what present after all the swaps.  

Here's how we can do it:

* **Start with the initial colors:**  We know Alice has purple, Bob has brown, Claire has red, Dave has green, Eve has black, Fred has yellow, and Gertrude has white.

* **Think about the swaps:**  We need to consider what happens when people swap gifts.  

* **The key is to think about the order of the swaps:**  The order of the swaps matters because it determines who ends up with which color.

Bob and Claire swap, so Bob gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Bob's brown ball.  Then Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's white ball.  Finally, Eve and Gertrude swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's pink ball and Gertrude gets Eve's white ball.  

Now, let's look at the final distribution of the balls.  

**Answer:** (G) brown ball 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Claire switched partners, then Fred and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Eve and Bob switched partners.  Eve and Alice switched partners.  Dave and Bob switched partners.  Dave and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Alice and Dave switched partners. 

So, who is Alice dancing with at the end? 

**The answer is (A) Rodrigo.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred is with Rodrigo at the end.  So the answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has:

* **Start:** We know Gertrude has a purple present.
* **Claire and Bob Swap:**  This doesn't change anything, as they swap colors.
* **Fred and Bob Swap:** Fred's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Fred's.
* **Dave and Claire Swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Claire Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Alice and Dave Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Eve Swap:** This changes the colors.

**The answer is (E) purple present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  We need to follow the order of the swaps to see who ends up with who. 

* **Start:** Bob-Sam, Claire-Jamie, Dave-Ophelia, Eve-Helga, Fred-Izzi, Gertrude-Rodrigo
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob-Sam, Claire-Jamie
* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred-Izzi, Alice-Bob
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob-Ophelia, Dave-Claire
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice-Ophelia, Bob-Claire
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice-Rodrigo, Eve-Claire
* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice-Helga, Dave-Rodrigo

**So, Claire is dancing with Jamie.** 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  We need to think about how each swap affects the gifts. 

Here's what we know:

* **Initial:** Alice: Pink, Bob: Yellow, Claire: White, Dave: Blue, Eve: Purple, Fred: Red, Gertrude: Orange.

* **Swaps:** We need to see how each swap changes the gifts. 

Let me know if you want to try another scenario! 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a book.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her book, and Eve gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Bob's book.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Dave's book.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Gertrude gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Gertrude's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

**The Answer:**

Gertrude has **The Pearl** at the end of the semester. 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire starts with Patrick.  Then, Fred and Alice switch partners.  Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Claire and Eve switch partners.  Fred and Dave switch partners.  Claire and Alice switch partners.  Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. 

So, Claire is now dancing with Bob. 

The answer is **(B) Patrick.** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change the ownership of either book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

**The key is to remember that the swaps are happening in a specific order.**

**Final State:**

* **Bob** ends up with **The Pearl** because he swapped with Fred and then with Gertrude.


**Therefore, the answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has the brown present at the end, we need to see how the gifts are swapped.  

Here's what we know:

* **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.

**The key is to understand that the gifts are being swapped, not necessarily changing colors or types.** 

**The problem is missing information.**

"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Alice and Fred swap:** Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
2. **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
3. **Bob and Dave swap:** Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
5. **Claire and Fred swap:** Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
6. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
7. **Alice and Eve swap:** Eve gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Eve's ball.

**Fred ends up with the green ball.** 


So the answer is **(E)**.

"Bob is dancing with Ophelia! 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final book Bob has:

* **Start with the initial distribution:**  We know everyone starts with a new book.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are exchanged. 
* **Identify the key swaps:**  We need to see which books are swapped and who swapped them. 

Let's break it down step by step. 

**Final Answer:**  Bob has **Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"The answer is **(E) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.

"Fred ends up with The Great Gatsby!  Here's why:

* **Fred starts with Frankenstein.**
* **Fred and Dave swap books.**  Dave now has Frankenstein.
* **Eve and Fred swap books.** Eve now has Frankenstein.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap books.** Bob now has Frankenstein.
* **Alice and Bob swap books.** Bob now has The Great Gatsby.

"The answer is **(A) Lolita**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Eve and Bob swap books.
2. Fred and Gertrude swap books.
3. Claire and Fred swap books.
4. Dave and Eve swap books.
5. Gertrude and Claire swap books.
6. Alice and Gertrude swap books.
7. Claire and Bob swap books.

We can see that the final book that Bob has is Lolita. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the balls are swapped:

1. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Fred his ball.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Fred his ball.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave his ball, and Dave gives Eve her ball.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Alice her ball.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.
7. **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Claire his ball.

**The final ball distribution is:**

* Gertrude has the **purple** ball. 



"
"Eve ends up with Dave's book, which is Ulysses. 

The answer is **(A) Ulysses**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means they both started with different books.

**Conclusion:**

The swaps are happening in a way that keeps the books changing hands.  We can't determine the final book Gertrude has based on the information given.

"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  

* **First, Bob and Fred switch partners.**  
* **Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.**
* **Then, Claire and Dave switch partners.**
* **Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
* **Then, Claire and Bob switch partners.**
* **Then, Dave and Fred switch partners.**
* **Finally, Eve and Alice switch partners.**

Looking at the final dance, Claire is now dancing with Sam. 

The answer is **(A) Sam.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Alice starts with a white present.  Here's how the swaps go:

* Fred and Eve swap:  Fred gets purple, Eve gets green.
* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets pink, Dave gets orange.
* Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets white, Alice gets pink.
* Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets black, Claire gets orange.
* Fred and Eve swap: Fred gets green, Eve gets purple.
* Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets brown, Claire gets black.
* Fred and Gertrude swap: Fred gets brown, Gertrude gets green.

The only gift that remains unchanged is Alice's. 

**Answer:** (F) orange ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book to start. 
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see which books were swapped and who swapped them. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Dave's book.
2. **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Eve gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Eve's book.
3. **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Dave's book.
4. **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Gertrude gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Gertrude's book.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:**  This means Alice gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Alice's book.
6. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Bob's book.
7. **Alice and Fred swap:**  This means Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.

**The answer is (E) Hound of the Baskervilles.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has what after all the swaps:

* **Start:** We know Alice has pink, Bob has brown, Claire has red, Dave has blue, Eve has white, Fred has orange, and Gertrude has black.

* **Alice and Dave Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now switched.

* **Claire and Dave Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now switched.

* **Fred and Gertrude Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now switched.

* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now switched.

"Gertrude ends up playing fullback!  She and Bob switched positions in the last trade.  So the answer is (G). 
 
Let me know if you have any other soccer questions! ⚽ 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is Center Midfielder, Bob is Striker, Claire is Left Winger, Dave is Cheerleader, Eve is Fullback, Fred is Right Winger, and Gertrude is Benchwarmer.

2. **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes Left Winger, Claire becomes Center Midfielder.

3. **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes Striker, Bob becomes Fullback.

4. **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Alice becomes Fullback.

5. **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire becomes Right Winger, Fred becomes Center Midfielder.

6. **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes Cheerleader, Dave becomes Fullback.

7. **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Fred becomes Center Midfielder.

8. **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Striker, Bob becomes Right Winger.

**Final Positions:**

* Alice: Fullback
* Bob: Striker
* Claire: Right Winger
* Dave: Cheerleader
* Eve: Center Midfielder
* Fred: Striker
* Gertrude: Benchwarmer


**Answer:** (F) right winger 



"
"Eve gets the blue ball!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Fred is playing left winger!  

The final positions are:

* **Fred:** Left winger
* **Alice:** Cheerleader
* **Bob:** Right winger
* **Claire:** Fullback
* **Dave:** Striker
* **Eve:** Benchwarmer
* **Gertrude:**  Right midfielder 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **We know they all start with a new book.**  
* **The swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Fred and Dave swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
2. **Eve and Fred swap:**  This means Eve had a book Fred traded.
3. **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
5. **Eve and Bob swap:**  This means Eve had a book Bob traded.
6. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
7. **Fred and Claire swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.

**The swaps are happening in a circular fashion, so we can deduce that the final book ownership is:**

* **Gertrude:**  Ulysses
* **Bob:**  The Great Gatsby
* **Dave:**  The Odyssey
* **Alice:**  Moby Dick

"Fred is dancing with Izzi!  The answer is (E). 
"
"The answer is **(A) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude gives Bob her ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave takes Bob's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave takes Fred's ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude takes Dave's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve takes Alice's ball.

Dave ends up with the ball he swapped with Fred. Bob ends up with the ball he swapped with Gertrude. Claire ends up with the ball she swapped with Bob. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means Alice is now dancing with someone else.
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners:** This means Claire is now dancing with someone else.
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means Bob is now dancing with someone else.
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** This means Eve is now dancing with someone else.
5. **Claire and Fred switch partners:** This means Fred is now dancing with someone else.
6. **Fred and Alice switch partners:** This means Alice is now dancing with someone else.
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** This means Dave is now dancing with someone else.

Now, let's look at the final dance.  

**The answer is (E) Melissa.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the balls are swapped:

1. Fred and Eve swap.
2. Claire and Bob swap.
3. Fred and Bob swap.
4. Eve and Alice swap.
5. Bob and Gertrude swap.
6. Bob and Claire swap.
7. Dave and Eve swap.

The final ball that Claire has is the yellow ball. 

**Answer: (D) yellow ball.** 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up with the brown present.  

The answer is **(A) brown present.** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
2. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Alice switch partners.**
4. **Eve and Gertrude switch partners.**
5. **Fred and Claire switch partners.**
6. **Fred and Bob switch partners.**

"The answer is **(E) Moby Dick**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

* Each person gets a new book at the start.
* The trades don't change the ownership of any books. 


Let me know if you have any other book-related puzzles! 📚

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Fred and Alice:** Fred gets Alice's blue ball, and Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
2. **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gets Gertrude's green ball, and Gertrude gets Claire's brown ball.
3. **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's purple ball, and Dave gets Bob's red ball.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gets Alice's blue ball, and Alice gets Eve's black ball.
5. **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Bob's red ball, and Bob gets Claire's brown ball.
6. **Dave and Eve:** Dave gets Eve's black ball, and Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
7. **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Bob's red ball, and Bob gets Claire's brown ball.

**Final State:** Claire ends up with the brown ball. 


**Answer:** (D)

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how the balls are distributed after each swap:

1. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Fred his ball.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Fred his ball.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve her ball.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Alice her ball.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.

**The final ball holder is Claire.** 

**The answer is (C) orange ball.**

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:** The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave started with a different book than Gertrude.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave started with a different book than Claire.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob started with different books.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire started with different books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This means Alice and Gertrude started with different books.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob and Alice started with different books.

**The key is to keep track of who started with which book.** 

**Here's a possible solution:**

1. **Gertrude:** Frankenstein
2. **Fred:** The Pearl
3. **Dave:** The Odyssey
4. **Claire:** The Great Gatsby
5. **Alice:** Hound of the Baskervilles
6. **Bob:** Lolita
7. **Eve:** Ulysses

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up with Dave's book because of the final swap.  

The correct answer is **(B) Catch-22**. 


"
"Eve is the striker!  The final position is striker. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as a left midfielder.  She then trades with Dave, becoming a left winger.  Then, she trades with Claire, becoming a benchwarmer.  Then, she trades with Dave again, becoming a left midfielder.  Claire then trades with Fred, becoming a left winger.  Dave then trades with Eve, becoming a cheerleader.  Finally, Gertrude and Bob trade positions. 

So, Alice is now playing left winger. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"The answer is **(G) pink ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

* Eve and Dave swap, then Eve and Fred swap, then Eve and Dave swap again. This means Eve ends up with the red ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, then Bob and Alice swap. This means Alice ends up with the red ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, and we know Claire ends up with the pink ball.

"The answer is **(C) purple ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Eve swap.
2. Dave and Fred swap.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap.
4. Fred and Claire swap.
5. Bob and Fred swap.
6. Gertrude and Bob swap.
7. Gertrude and Claire swap.

Notice that Alice is the only one who ends up with the purple ball. 



"
"Eve is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(G) Jamie**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) blue present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets yellow, Fred gets orange.
2. Bob and Fred swap: Bob gets yellow, Fred gets orange.
3. Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets orange, Dave gets blue.
4. Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets pink, Claire gets orange.
5. Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets purple, Eve gets orange.
6. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets black, Bob gets purple.
7. Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets white, Alice gets black.

Dave ends up with the blue present. 



"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Gertrude ends up with the pink ball because of the following swaps:

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This changes Gertrude's present to black and Dave's present to orange.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** This changes Eve's present to brown and Fred's present to red.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to orange and Bob's present to white.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This changes Claire's present to yellow and Alice's present to pink.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to orange and Bob's present to white.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Start:** Alice-Patrick, Bob-Rodrigo, Claire-Sam, Dave-Ophelia, Eve-Jamie, Fred-Karl, Gertrude-Lola
2. **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred-Lola, Gertrude-Fred
3. **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave-Sam, Claire-Dave
4. **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave-Rodrigo, Bob-Dave
5. **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob-Sam, Claire-Bob
6. **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice-Rodrigo, Gertrude-Alice
7. **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave-Jamie, Alice-Dave
8. **Eve and Gertrude switch:** Eve-Lola, Gertrude-Eve

**The final dance:**  Alice is now dancing with **Sam**. 



 
"
"The answer is **(C) green ball**. 

Here's why:  We can see that Gertrude ends up with the green ball after all the trades. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

* **Bob and Dave switch partners:**  This means Dave is now with Alice, and Bob is with Ophelia.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:**  This means Gertrude is now with Jamie, and Fred is with Melissa.
* **Fred and Bob switch partners:**  This means Fred is now with Alice, and Bob is with Helga.
* **Eve and Bob switch partners:**  This means Eve is now with Karl, and Bob is with Melissa.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:**  This means Gertrude is now with Patrick, and Alice is with Fred.
* **Fred and Claire switch partners:**  This means Fred is now with Lola, and Claire is with Helga.
* **Claire and Eve switch partners:**  This means Claire is now with Karl, and Eve is with Melissa.

**Therefore, Fred is dancing with Melissa.** 


The answer is (D). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Claire has:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Blue
    * Bob: Purple
    * Claire: White
    * Dave: Orange
    * Eve: Yellow
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Pink

* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  This changes Bob's present to Pink and Gertrude's to Purple.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Orange and Dave's to Pink.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This changes Eve's present to Pink and Gertrude's to Yellow.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes Bob's present to Yellow and Dave's to Pink.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Orange and Dave's to White.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Fred's present to Blue and Alice's to Brown.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes Bob's present to Yellow and Eve's to Blue.

**Final State:**

* **Claire:**  We need to figure out what Claire's present is.  

**The answer is (D) orange ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob is starting with Karl.  We know Fred and Claire switch partners, then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then Dave and Eve switch partners.  Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Alice and Bob switch partners again.  Alice and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Fred and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (G) Melissa

**Answer: (E) Sam** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **The swaps:** We need to track who gets which book after each swap.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with The Great Gatsby, Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave starts with The Odyssey.
5. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Gertrude starts with Lolita.
6. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with The Odyssey, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.
7. **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Eve starts with Lolita.

**The Final Swap:** Fred and Eve swap books, so Eve ends up with Frankenstein.

**Therefore, the answer is (E) Frankenstein.**

    * Dave: Catch-22
    * Eve: The Odyssey
    * Fred: Moby Dick
    * Gertrude: Ulysses

* **Swaps:**
    * Eve and Gertrude swap:  Eve gets Ulysses, Gertrude gets The Odyssey
    * Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets The Odyssey, Eve gets The Great Gatsby
    * Alice and Gertrude swap: Alice gets The Odyssey, Gertrude gets Ulysses
    * Claire and Eve swap: Claire gets The Odyssey, Eve gets Catch-22
    * Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Catch-22, Alice gets The Odyssey
    * Fred and Alice swap: Fred gets The Odyssey, Alice gets Catch-22
    * Eve and Dave swap: Eve gets Catch-22, Dave gets The Odyssey

* **Final Ownership:**  

    * Alice has **The Great Gatsby**. 



 
"
"Fred is playing right winger at the end of the match. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We know Alice has a blue present, Bob has a green present, Claire has a brown present, Dave has a purple present, Eve has an orange ball, Fred has a pink ball, and Gertrude has a red present.

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Eve's. 
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Fred's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Gertrude's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Claire's.

**The final result is that Alice has the brown present.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Gertrude starts with the orange ball.  Here's what happens when the gifts are swapped:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob's green gift goes to Alice, and Alice's green gift goes to Bob.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire's purple gift goes to Dave, and Dave's red gift goes to Claire.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob's white gift goes to Gertrude, and Gertrude's orange ball goes to Bob.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred's yellow gift goes to Bob, and Bob's white gift goes to Fred.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire's purple gift goes to Eve, and Eve's blue gift goes to Claire.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice's green gift goes to Bob, and Bob's white gift goes to Alice.

**The final gift Gertrude has is the orange ball.**

"The answer is **(B) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Eve swap.
2. Dave and Fred swap.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap.
4. Fred and Claire swap.
5. Bob and Fred swap.
6. Gertrude and Bob swap.
7. Gertrude and Claire swap.

Notice that the ball swapping always results in a new player holding the ball that was previously held by the other player.  This means that the final player holding the ball is the one who received the ball that was previously held by the other player. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the game! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to see how the colors are distributed at the end.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Claire and Bob:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Claire and Dave:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Fred and Gertrude:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Fred:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Alice and Dave:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.

**Conclusion:**

The swaps don't change the color of the balls. 

**Answer:**  None of the above. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Claire swap balls first, so Claire now has the purple ball.  Then Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets the purple ball.  

Next, Claire and Alice swap, so Alice now has the purple ball.  Then Bob and Alice swap again, so Bob has the purple ball.

Dave and Eve swap, so Dave now has the purple ball.  Finally, Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred has the purple ball.  

And then Gertrude and Claire swap, so Claire has the pink ball. 


**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Fred and Eve trade:** Fred becomes left midfielder, Eve becomes right winger.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Claire becomes right winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes left winger, Alice becomes center midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes right winger, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes left winger, Alice becomes striker.

"Okay, let's break down the ball trades! 

Here's how the game goes:

* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gives Fred her green ball, and Fred gets Alice's green ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gives Eve her orange ball, and Eve gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gives Gertrude her purple ball, and Gertrude gets Dave's purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gives Dave his brown ball, and Dave gets Eve's brown ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gets Fred's pink ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob her orange ball, and Bob gets Claire's orange ball.

**The final ball distribution is:**

* **Dave:** Has the **purple ball** 

**Answer:** (E) 



"
"The answer is **(D) Catch-22**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see how the books end up:

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob gets The Great Gatsby.
2. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Alice gets Frankenstein.
3. **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gets Ulysses, Gertrude gets Catch-22.
4. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gets The Pearl, Fred gets Lolita.
5. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets Catch-22, Claire gets Ulysses.
6. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets Ulysses, Claire gets Catch-22.
7. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gets Catch-22, Dave gets Lolita.

Dave ends up with Lolita. 



"
"Eve is dancing with Helga!  

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Let's break down the swaps and see who ends up with which book!

* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap books.
* **Claire and Bob:** Swap books.
* **Alice and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap books.
* **Dave and Fred:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Claire:** Swap books.
* **Eve and Fred:** Swap books.

The final swap is Eve and Fred.  

**Therefore, the answer is (E) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude gives Bob her ball, and Bob gives Gertrude his ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Dave his ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Gertrude his ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.

**The answer is (G) red ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Dave is with someone new at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* Fred and Eve switch partners.
* Bob and Eve switch partners.
* Fred and Dave switch partners.
* Bob and Fred switch partners.
* Bob and Gertrude switch partners.
* Fred and Dave switch partners.
* Claire and Alice switch partners.

The final dance is with someone new.  

**The answer is (A) Ophelia.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Fred swapped balls, then Dave and Claire swapped, and so on.  Let's see who ends up with what ball. 

* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with pink, Eve starts with orange. They swap, so Fred now has orange and Eve has pink.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with black, Claire starts with red. They swap, so Claire now has black and Dave has red.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice starts with white, Gertrude starts with purple. They swap, so Gertrude now has white and Alice has purple.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude now has white, Eve has pink. They swap, so Eve now has white and Gertrude has pink.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve now has white, Fred has orange. They swap, so Fred now has white and Eve has orange.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred now has white, Alice has orange. They swap, so Alice now has white and Fred has orange.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice now has white, Bob has yellow. They swap, so Bob now has white and Alice has yellow.

**Therefore, Bob has the yellow ball at the end.** 

**Answer:** (D) 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!  

Claire starts with a pink ball.  We know that the gifts are swapped around, but the colors don't change.  So, Claire ends up with the pink ball. 

The answer is **(G) pink ball**. 
"
"Eve ends up with the green present!  The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice's pink goes to Claire's blue.
2. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's brown goes to Bob's red.
3. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice's pink goes to Gertrude's black.
4. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire's blue goes to Gertrude's black.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's pink goes to Eve's yellow.
6. **Fred and Dave swap:** Fred's white goes to Dave's brown.
7. **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire's blue goes to Alice's pink.

Now, let's look at the final gift Dave has.  

**The correct answer is (E) red present.** 



"
"Gertrude is dancing with Dave at the end of the dance!  The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:**  We know each person has a unique color ball. 
* **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so they both get a new ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Swap, so they both get a new ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Swap, so they both get a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap, so they both get a new ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap, so they both get a new ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both get a new ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Swap, so they both get a new ball.

**The answer is (E) the pink ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out the answer:

* **Initial Ownership:** We know each person starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:** We need to track the swaps to see how the books end up. 

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Eve's.
2. **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Fred's.
3. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
4. **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice's book is now Fred's, and Fred's book is now Alice's.
5. **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's book is now Dave's, and Dave's book is now Claire's.
6. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
7. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve's book is now Bob's, and Bob's book is now Eve's.

**Analyzing the swaps:**

* **Alice:** Alice's book is always the one that is swapped with Fred. 
* **Fred:** Fred's book is always the one that is swapped with Alice. 
* **Claire:** Claire's book is always the one that is swapped with Dave and Fred. 
* **Bob:** Bob's book is always the one that is swapped with Gertrude. 
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude's book is always the one that is swapped with Bob. 
* **Eve:** Eve's book is always the one that is swapped with Bob. 
* **Dave:** Dave's book is always the one that is swapped with Claire. 


**Conclusion:**

The only way to get to the end of the semester with Alice having The Odyssey is if she and Fred swapped books.

We know that at the end of the gift exchange, Claire has the white present.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Scenario 1:** If Bob and Claire swap their gifts, and Alice and Claire swap their gifts, then Bob would end up with the white present.

After the swaps, Alice will have Bob's present, which is the black ball. 



"
"The answer is **(C).**  Bob ends up with the brown ball. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out the answer:

* **Start:** Alice has white, Bob has orange, and Claire has brown.
* **Bob and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they got, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Bob Swap:**  We don't know what they got, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Alice Swap:**  We don't know what they got, but we know the order is important.

**The order of the swaps matters!** 

So, we can't determine the final color of the present Bob has. 


**The answer is (None of the above)** 
"
"The answer is **(A)**.  Claire ends up playing fullback. 
"
"The answer is **(B)**.  Claire starts as a left winger and then trades with Bob, then with Claire again.  So, she ends up back in her original position. 
 
 
"
"The answer is **(C) Melissa**. 

Here's why:

* Bob and Claire switch partners first.
* Then Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners again. 

This means Bob ends up with Melissa. 
"
"The answer is **(B) pink ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice gets Bob's pink ball, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Alice gets Claire's purple present, and Claire gets Alice's blue present. 

Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"The answer is **(A)**.  

Here's why:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire starts with a white ball, and Alice starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Claire gets the yellow ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice now has the white ball, and Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the white ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has the white ball, and Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the white ball and Bob gets the orange ball. 



 
"
"The answer is **(C).**  Claire starts as a cheerleader, then trades with Bob to become a fullback.  Then, she trades with Alice to become a cheerleader again.  Finally, Bob and Alice trade positions, and Claire ends up in the fullback position. 


"
"The answer is **(C) yellow present**. 

Here's why:

* Claire starts with a pink ball.
* Alice starts with a yellow present.
* Bob starts with a red present.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Bob's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Claire's present, and Bob gets Alice's present.

Since Claire started with a pink ball, and Alice started with a yellow present, the only possible outcome is that Claire ends up with the yellow present. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

Alice, Bob, and Claire each start with a new book.  They trade books throughout the semester.  

Here's how the trades go:

1. **Initial:** Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, and Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

2. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Claire gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

3. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Bob gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

4. **Final:**  Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Claire has *Lolita*.


So the answer is **(C) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) Patrick**. 

Here's why:

* Alice and Bob switch partners first, so Alice is now with Claire and Bob is with Lola.
* Then, Claire and Bob switch partners, so Claire is now with Alice and Bob is with Patrick.
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire and Alice is with Rodrigo. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

Here's how the gift exchange works:

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they exchange their presents.  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means they exchange their presents again.

The key is that the order of the swaps matters.  

Let's think about the possibilities:

* **Alice starts with yellow**
* **Bob starts with blue**
* **Claire starts with green**

**Scenario 1: Alice and Bob swap first**

* Alice gets Bob's present (blue)
* Bob gets Alice's present (yellow)

**Scenario 2: Claire and Alice swap first**

* Claire gets Alice's present (yellow)
* Alice gets Claire's present (green)

**Scenario 3: Alice and Bob swap second**

* Alice gets Bob's present (blue)
* Bob gets Alice's present (yellow)

**Conclusion:**

The only way Alice ends up with the green present is if Claire and Alice swap first. 


**Therefore, the answer is (A) green present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions:

* **Start:** Alice is center midfielder, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left winger.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire becomes goalkeeper, Alice becomes left winger.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice becomes goalkeeper, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes left winger, Bob becomes center midfielder.

So, at the end of the match, Bob is playing **center midfielder**. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"The answer is **(B) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Initial:** Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *Catch-22*, and Claire has *Ulysses*.

2. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *Catch-22*.

3. **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire gets *Catch-22* and Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Alice starts with a red present, Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a pink ball.  

Here's how the swapping works:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice starts with a red present, and Claire starts with a pink ball, they swap.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Claire's pink ball, and Bob has Alice's red present, they swap.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Bob's red present, and Claire has Bob's black ball, they swap.

**So, Claire ends up with the black ball.**

"Okay, so let's break it down! 

Alice starts with a red present, Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a pink ball.  

Here's what happens:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets the pink ball and Claire gets the red present.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice gets the pink ball and Bob gets the red present.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:**  Claire gets the red present and Alice gets the pink ball.

So, Bob ends up with the pink ball! 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

* **Start:** Alice is fullback, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left midfielder.
* **First Trade:** Claire and Alice switch positions.  Claire becomes fullback, and Alice becomes left midfielder.

"The final position Claire is playing is striker! 

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"The answer is **(B)**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice:**  Claire gets Bob's brown present, and Alice gets Claire's white present.
2. **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets Claire's white present, and Claire gets Bob's brown present.
3. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's brown present, and Bob gets Alice's blue present. 

Since Bob started with a brown present, he ends up with the blue present. 



"
"The answer is **(A) orange ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Alice gets Claire's brown present, and Claire gets Alice's blue present. 

Since Alice started with a blue present, and then received a brown present from Claire, and then received an orange ball from Bob, Alice will end up with the orange ball. 



"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"The answer is **(C) right midfielder**. 

Here's why:

*  Bob and Alice switch positions, so Bob becomes the goalkeeper and Alice becomes the right midfielder.
*  Alice and Claire switch positions, so Alice becomes the goalkeeper and Claire becomes the right midfielder.
*  Finally, Bob and Alice switch positions again, so Bob becomes the left midfielder and Alice becomes the right midfielder. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves! 

* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners again:** This means they swap places again.

The final dance is Claire with Jamie. 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners again:** This means they swap places again.

So, the answer is **(B) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Alice has red, Bob has black, and Claire has white.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. Again, we don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.

The order of the swaps matters!  Let's think about the possibilities:

* **Scenario 1:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, then Claire would end up with the red present. 
* **Scenario 2:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, then Claire would end up with the black ball. 
* **Scenario 3:** If Bob and Claire swap, and then Alice and Bob swap, and then Claire and Alice swap, then Claire would end up with the white present. 

**Therefore, the answer is (C) black ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(A)**.  Bob ends up with the pink ball.
