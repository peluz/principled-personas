"Okay, so we got three houses, right?  And each house has a person.  We know the people are different, like one plays soccer, one plays basketball, and one swims.  And they all eat different fruits, like bananas, mangos, and oranges.  And they got flowers in their house, like tulips, lilies, and daffodils.

"Okay, so we got three houses, right?  And each house has a person.  We know they play different instruments, wear different shoes, and eat different fruits.  We also know they have different things like TVs, phones, and radios.

Here's what I think:

* **The piano person isn't in the first house.**  That's a rule.
* **The person with the oranges is to the right of the person with the kiwis.**  That's a clue.
* **The person with the high heels and the piano person are next to each other.**  That's another clue.

"Okay, so we got a bunch of people and stuff, right?  We gotta figure out where the guy with the sedan lives.

* **Blue next to truck:**  That's a clue!

"Okay, so we got three houses, right?  One person in each.  We know some things about them:

* The truck guy isn't in the last house.
* The SUV guy isn't in the last house.
* The truck guy isn't in the first house.
* The guy eating kiwis is in the first house.

So, we know the SUV guy can't be in the last house, and the truck guy can't be in the first house.  That leaves the SUV guy in the second house. 

**So the answer is 2.**

"Okay, so we got three houses, right?  One, two, and three.  And each house has a person.  

We know this:

* The person in the third house ate fried rice.
* The person who ate spaghetti is next to the person who ate fried rice.

So, the third house has fried rice, and the person next to it has spaghetti.

We also know the swimmer lives in the first house.

The last clue tells us the cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

So, the order is:

1. Swimmer
2. Spaghetti
3. Fried Rice

The person who ate spaghetti is in house **2**.

"Okay, so we got five houses, right?  And each house has a person.  We know one person is wearing sandals, one is wearing running shoes, and so on.  

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person wearing running shoes and the person wearing boots live next to each other.

So, the first house has to be the one with the running shoes.  

We also know that the person who owns a sedan doesn't live in the third house.  

Let me think...

* **Clue 4:** The person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
* **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan lives to the left of the person who wears high heels.

Okay, so the person wearing sandals is to the left of the person who drives a convertible.  And the person who drives a minivan is to the left of the person who wears high heels.

We also know the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

So, the person wearing running shoes has to be in the first house.

The truck guy is to the right of the basketball guy, so the basketball guy can't be in the first house.  

The horse guy is to the left of the sedan guy, so the sedan guy can't be in the first house. 

So, the basketball guy has to be in the second house.

"Okay, so we got four houses, right?  And each house has a person.  We know some things about them:

* **Shoes:** One person has running shoes, one has high heels, one has boots, and one has sandals.
* **Lunch:** One had stew, one had grilled cheese, one had spaghetti, and one had fried rice.
* **Drink:** One likes tea, one likes milk, one only drinks water, and one likes root beer.

We know the tea drinker lives in the third house.  And the person who had stew is to the left of the person who had spaghetti.  The person who only drinks water is to the right of the person who had grilled cheese.  And the person who wears sandals is to the right of the person who has high heels.

So, we got a lot of clues!  Let's see...

**What's the answer?**

* (A) 4
* (B) 3
* (C) 1
* (D) 2

"Okay, so we got a bunch of people and stuff, right?  We gotta figure out where they live and what they like. 

Here's what we know:

* **Shoes:** One person has high heels, one has boots, one has loafers, and one has running shoes.
* **Drinks:** One likes coffee, one likes tea, one likes milk, and one likes root beer.
* **Devices:** One has a radio, one has a gameboy, one has a computer, and one has a TV.
* **Sports:** One is a basketball player, one is a soccer player, one is a cricketer, and one is a tennis player.
* **Lunch:** One had spaghetti, one had stew, one had fried rice, and one had grilled cheese.

Now, we gotta figure out where they live!

**Here's what I think:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
* **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
* **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 8:** The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 9:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
* **Clue 10:** The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 11:** The cricketer lives in the third house.
* **Clue 12:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

**So, I think...**

* **The person with the computer lives in house C.**

So, I think the person who eats mangos lives in the **third** house.

"Okay, so we got five houses, right?  And each house has a person.  We gotta figure out where the saxophonist lives.

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:**  The percussionist and the guitarist are next to each other.
* **Clue 2:**  The cellist isn't in the last house.
* **Clue 3:**  The TV guy is next to the red guy.
* **Clue 4:**  The guitarist is next to the yellow guy.
* **Clue 5:**  There are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist.
* **Clue 6:**  The phone guy is next to the gameboy guy.
* **Clue 7:**  The green guy lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:**  The percussionist is next to the white guy.
* **Clue 9:**  The red guy isn't in the second house.
* **Clue 10:**  The radio guy is in the third house.
* **Clue 11:**  The computer guy isn't in the second house.
* **Clue 12:**  The computer guy is next to the phone guy.

Okay, so we got a lot of clues.  Let's see...

**Which house is the saxophonist in?**

(A) 2
(B) 4
(C) 3
(D) 1
(E) 5

"Okay, so we got two houses, right? One's number one, the other's number two.  

We know some things about the people who live there:

* **One person likes tea, one likes root beer.**
* **One plays a cello, one plays a guitar.**
* **One has horses, one has a cat.**
* **One likes mystery books, one likes history books.**

We can figure out where the horses person lives! 

**Here's how:**

* The person who likes root beer and the guitar player are next to each other.

"Okay, so listen:

Eve and Bob trade balls, right?  Eve gets Bob's ball, and Bob gets Eve's ball.  Then Eve and Dave trade, and Eve gets Dave's ball.  Then Alice and Eve trade, and Alice gets Eve's ball.  Finally, Alice and Claire trade, and Claire gets Alice's ball.

So, who has the ball at the end?  Dave! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with presents, right?  They swap gifts, and we gotta figure out who has what at the end.  

Here's what we know:

* **Alice** has a red present.
* **Bob** has a yellow present.
* **Claire** has a pink ball.
* **Dave** has a brown present.
* **Eve** has a purple present.

Now, they swap gifts, and we don't know who got what.  It's like a big game of guess who! 

So, the answer is...  **none of the above!** 



"
"Okay, so listen:

* Bob and Alice switch partners.
* Then Bob and Claire switch partners.
* Then Dave and Claire switch partners.
* Then Eve and Dave switch partners.
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners again.

So, who's with Claire at the end?

"Okay, so listen:

Bob and Eve switch partners.  Then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Eve and Bob switch partners again.  Then Dave and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Eve and Claire switch partners.  

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end?

"
"Okay, so listen:

* Bob starts in the middle, like the boss of the team.
* Then Dave and Eve switch places, so Dave is on the outside now.
* Then Dave and Claire switch again, so Dave is back in the middle.
* Then Eve and Dave switch again, so Eve is back on the outside.
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch places, so Bob is now on the bench.

So the answer is **(E) benchwarmer**. 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls.  Bob and Claire trade, then Alice and Dave, then Dave and Claire again, and so on.  The last one swaps with Bob and Eve.  So, who has the ball?  

The answer is **(D) brown ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls.  They trade them around.

* Claire and Alice trade, so they switch colors again.
* Dave and Eve trade, so they switch colors.
* Bob and Alice trade, so they switch colors.
* Claire and Alice trade again, so they switch colors.

So, who has the ball at the end?  

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, so we got these colors: green, blue, red, yellow, and purple.  

Let's see...  

* **First swap:**  Claire and Alice switch presents.  
* **Second swap:** Bob and Eve switch presents.
* **Third swap:** Alice and Dave switch presents.
* **Fourth swap:** Bob and Dave switch presents.
* **Fifth swap:** Dave and Eve switch presents.

So, who got the yellow present?

* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets a green ball, Claire gets a brown ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets a brown ball, Claire gets an orange ball.

So, the last person with a ball is Eve.  She has the orange ball. 

**Answer: (E)** 



"
"Okay, so listen:

Gertrude starts as the goalie. Then, Bob switches places with Gertrude.  Then, Eve and Alice switch places.  Then, Gertrude and Dave switch places.  Then, Dave and Fred switch places.  Then, Claire and Eve switch places.  Then, Fred and Claire switch places.  

So, at the end, Gertrude is playing striker. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They're all trading them.  Let's see...

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

So, who got the ball that was originally held by Alice?  It's Dave!

So, who got the ball that was originally Claire's?  It's gotta be the yellow ball!

"

So, Fred is now a left winger. 

The answer is **(B) left winger**. 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  Let's see...

* **First, Claire and Bob swap balls.**  That means they both get a different color ball.

So, the last person to swap balls is Bob.  He has to have the ball that was in the last swap.  That means Bob has the **(D) orange ball**. 



"
"Okay, so listen up!  

Bob was the goalie at the start, right?  Then, some people switched places.  Gertrude and Eve switched, then Gertrude and Alice switched.  Then Eve and Claire switched.  Fred and Eve switched again.  Claire and Gertrude switched again.  And then Claire and Dave switched.  Finally, Fred and Bob switched places. 

So, who's the goalie now?

"Okay, so they all got new books at the start, right?  Then they trade them around.  Let's see...

* **Claire and Gertrude swap books.**  
* **Fred and Dave swap books.**
* **Bob and Alice swap books.**
* **Eve and Gertrude swap books.**
* **Dave and Bob swap books.**
* **Fred and Eve swap books.**
* **Bob and Fred swap books.**

So, who gets what at the end?  I think... Eve gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.  That's what makes sense! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls.  Let's see...

Dave and Bob trade, so Dave gets a purple ball and Bob gets an orange ball.  Then Alice and Gertrude trade, so Alice gets a white ball and Gertrude gets a blue ball.  Gertrude and Eve trade, so Gertrude gets a black ball and Eve gets a white ball.  Claire and Eve trade, so Claire gets a black ball and Eve gets a white ball.  Eve and Fred trade, so Eve gets a pink ball and Fred gets a black ball.  Eve and Claire trade, so Eve gets a pink ball and Claire gets a black ball.  Finally, Dave and Fred trade, so Dave gets a pink ball and Fred gets a black ball.

So, Fred has the black ball!

* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

So, Bob ends up with the book he got from Gertrude. 

**The answer is (A).**

"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with presents, right?  They're all different colors.  

Now, they're gonna swap presents.  That's the fun part!  But we don't know what they got, so it's hard to say who has what. 

So, we gotta figure out who has what at the end.  

**Here's what we know:**

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  We don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  We don't know what they got.

**So, we can't figure out who has what!**

"Okay, so listen up!  Here's what we know:

* **Alice** was in the middle, like a midfielder, right?
* Then, Eve and Alice switched places.
* Then, Claire and Gertrude switched places.
* Fred stayed where he was.
* Dave moved around a lot!

So, Alice is probably still in the middle, right?  

**The answer is (F) center midfielder.** 



"
"Okay, so listen up!  Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Alice is sitting on the bench, Bob is cheering, Claire is in the back, Dave is the goalie, Eve is up front, Fred is on the right side, and Gertrude is on the left.

* **Gertrude and Claire switch places:** Gertrude goes to the back, Claire goes to the left.
* **Alice and Eve switch places:** Alice goes up front, Eve goes to the left.
* **Claire and Bob switch places:** Claire goes to the right, Bob goes to the back.
* **Eve and Dave switch places:** Eve goes to the back, Dave goes up front.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch places:** Claire goes to the left, Gertrude goes up front.
* **Dave and Gertrude switch places:** Dave goes to the left, Gertrude goes to the back.
* **Fred and Eve switch places:** Fred goes up front, Eve goes to the left.

So, now we know:

* **Bob is the cheerleader.** 
* **Alice is up front.**
* **Claire is on the left.**
* **Dave is up front.**

"

"Okay, so Fred got Frankenstein to start. Then, Fred traded with Dave, and then Eve got it.  Then, Gertrude and Bob traded, and Bob got it.  Then, Alice and Bob traded, and then Eve and Bob traded again.  Finally, Dave and Alice traded.  So, Fred got the book that Bob had.  

The answer is **(F) The Great Gatsby**. 



"
"Okay, so they all got new books at the start.  Then they trade books, right?  Eve and Bob trade, then Fred and Gertrude trade, and so on.  

The last trade is between Claire and Bob.  So, Bob has Lolita. 

**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They're all trading them.

So, Eve got Dave's book at the end.  What book did Dave get?  

**Answer: (A) Ulysses** 



"
"Okay, so they all got new books at the start.  Then they trade books.  It's like a big book swap party!  

Here's what we know:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:**  That means they both had different books to start with.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Same thing, they had different books.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Different books again.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Different books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Different books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Different books.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Different books.

So, we can't figure out who has what book at the end. 


**The answer is:**  We don't know!

* **Gertrude:**  She has a brown present.

Now, they swap presents.  So, Fred and Eve swap, then Bob and Dave swap, and so on.  It's a little confusing, but I think...

**Alice ends up with the orange ball!**

"Okay, so we got these people, right? They all got books at the start.  

Now, they trade books, right?  It's like a big book swap party!  

Let's see...

* **Alice** got The Odyssey.
* **Bob** got The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Claire** got Moby Dick.
* **Dave** got The Pearl.
* **Eve** got The Great Gatsby.
* **Fred** got Catch-22.
* **Gertrude** got Hound of the Baskervilles.

Now, they trade books, and I think it's important to remember who got what book.  

* **Gertrude and Dave** swap books.
* **Eve and Claire** swap books.
* **Dave and Gertrude** swap books.
* **Gertrude and Eve** swap books.
* **Alice and Eve** swap books.
* **Bob and Dave** swap books.
* **Alice and Fred** swap books.

So, who has the book at the end?  

**What's the answer?**

(A) Catch-22
(B) Moby Dick
(C) The Fellowship of the Ring
(D) The Pearl
(E) Hound of the Baskervilles
(F) The Great Gatsby
(G) The Odyssey 


 
"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with presents, right?  Let's see...

* **Alice** has pink.
* **Bob** has brown.
* **Claire** has red.
* **Dave** has blue.
* **Eve** has white.
* **Fred** has orange.
* **Gertrude** has black.

Now, they swap presents.  It's like a big game of tag with gifts!

First, **Alice and Dave** switch.  So, Dave gets Alice's pink, and Alice gets Dave's blue. 

Then, **Claire and Dave** switch.  Now Dave has Claire's red, and Claire has Dave's blue.

And then, **Fred and Gertrude** switch.  Gertrude gets Fred's orange, and Fred gets Gertrude's black.

Then, **Eve and Gertrude** switch.  Now Eve has Gertrude's black, and Gertrude has Eve's white.

Then, **Eve and Alice** switch.  Alice gets Eve's white, and Eve gets Alice's pink.

Finally, **Dave and Bob** switch.  Bob gets Dave's blue, and Dave gets Bob's brown.

So, who has the black ball?

"Okay, so listen up!  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts** as a left winger.
* **Bob** is a fullback.
* **Claire** is in the middle.
* **Dave** is on the right.
* **Eve** is sitting on the bench.
* **Fred** is cheering.
* **Gertrude** is a left midfielder.

Now, they trade positions.  It's like a big shuffle!

* Alice and Bob switch places.
* Dave and Eve switch places.
* Fred and Bob switch places.
* Alice and Eve switch places.
* Claire and Fred switch places.
* Claire and Bob switch places.
* Bob and Gertrude switch places.

So, who ends up where?  Gertrude is now a fullback! 

**The answer is (G).** 



"
"Okay, so listen:

* Alice starts in the middle, like the boss.
* Then Claire goes to the middle too.
* Then Gertrude goes to the front, like a striker.
* Then Eve goes to the middle.
* Then Claire goes to the right.
* Then Gertrude goes to the front again.
* Then Eve goes to the right.
* Then Fred goes to the front.

So, Claire is on the right now. 

**Answer:** (F) right winger 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls.  They trade them around.  

* Alice and Fred swap, Fred gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Fred's ball.
* Gertrude and Fred swap, Fred gets Gertrude's ball, and Gertrude gets Fred's ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, Dave gets Bob's ball, and Bob gets Dave's ball.
* Alice and Bob swap, Bob gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Bob's ball.
* Claire and Fred swap, Fred gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Fred's ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap, Gertrude gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Gertrude's ball.
* Alice and Eve swap, Eve gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Eve's ball.

So, Eve has the blue ball. 

**Answer: (C)**

**Answer:** (G) 



"
"Okay, so we got these people, right? They all got new books at the start. Then they trade books, like a big book swap party! 

Let's see... Fred and Dave swap books, then Eve and Fred swap books.  Then Gertrude and Bob swap books.  Alice and Bob swap books.  Eve and Bob swap books again.  Dave and Alice swap books.  And finally, Fred and Claire swap books.

So, who got what book at the end?  Let's look at the options:

* **(A) Moby Dick:**  Nope, that's not right.
* **(B) The Odyssey:**  Nope, that's not right.
* **(C) Hound of the Baskervilles:**  Nope, that's not right.
* **(D) Frankenstein:**  Nope, that's not right.
* **(E) Ulysses:**  That's the one!  Gertrude got Ulysses!
* **(F) The Pearl:**  Nope, that's not right.
* **(G) The Great Gatsby:**  Nope, that's not right.

**So the answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, so listen:

Eve was a left midfielder at the start. Then, some people switched places.  Bob and Alice switched, then Dave and Eve switched.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switched again.  Fred and Bob switched, then Claire and Fred switched.  Finally, Gertrude and Alice switched.  

So, Eve is still a left midfielder. 

The answer is **(D).** 



"
"Okay, so listen:

* Fred is with Gertrude at the start.
* Then Eve and Claire switch partners.
* Then Dave and Fred switch partners.
* Then Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Then Gertrude and Eve switch partners.
* Then Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Then Dave and Eve switch partners.
* Finally, Fred and Gertrude switch partners.

So, Fred is with Gertrude at the end. 

What's the answer? 
 
(B) Karl

So, Fred is with Izzi now. 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They trade them around.  

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  Gertrude gives Bob her ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave takes Bob's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave takes Fred's ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude takes Dave's ball.

* (F) Izzi
* (G) Lola

"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They trade them around.  Eve and Gertrude switch, then Dave and Alice, and so on.  It's like a big game of tag with balls!  

So, who ends up with the ball?  I think it's the yellow ball.  

**Answer: (E) yellow ball** 



"

"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They trade them around.  But it doesn't matter who has what ball, because they all trade them.  So, the answer is... none of the above.

"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They trade them around.  

First, Eve and Claire switch balls.  Then, Bob and Eve switch.  Then, Claire and Alice switch.  Then, Bob and Alice switch again.  Then, Dave and Eve switch.  Then, Fred and Gertrude switch.  And finally, Gertrude and Claire switch.

So, who has the ball at the end?  It's gotta be Claire! 

**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, so listen:

*  At the start, they all have jobs, right? Alice is the striker, Bob is the right winger, Claire is the middle guy, Dave is the cheerleader, Eve is the right midfielder, Fred is the left winger, and Gertrude is the left midfielder.

*  Then, Fred and Eve switch places.
*  Then, Eve and Claire switch places.
*  Then, Gertrude and Alice switch places.
*  Then, Dave and Bob switch places.
*  Then, Claire and Alice switch places.
*  Then, Bob and Alice switch places.
*  Finally, Gertrude and Eve switch places.

So, who's playing where at the end?  Dave is the right winger! 


**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Okay, so Fred got Frankenstein, right?  That's the first thing that happens.  Then, Fred and Eve swap books.  Then, Gertrude and Bob swap books.  Then, Claire and Alice swap books.  Then, Eve and Claire swap books.  Then, Eve and Bob swap books.  Then, Bob and Alice swap books.  So, Fred's book is Frankenstein. 


**Answer: (C) Frankenstein** 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They trade them, and then we gotta figure out who got what ball. 

* **First trade:** Alice and Fred swap.  
* **Second trade:** Claire and Eve swap.
* **Third trade:** Dave and Gertrude swap.
* **Fourth trade:** Eve and Dave swap.
* **Fifth trade:** Dave and Fred swap.
* **Sixth trade:** Fred and Claire swap.
* **Seventh trade:** Claire and Bob swap.

So, who got the ball?  I think it's Dave! 


**Answer:** (E) 



"
"Okay, so we got these people, right? They all got books at the start.  

Now, they trade books, right?  So, let's see...

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's book, Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's book, Alice gets Eve's book.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets Gertrude's book, Gertrude gets Claire's book.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets Fred's book, Fred gets Dave's book.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's book, Claire gets Gertrude's book.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Claire's book, Claire gets Eve's book.

"Okay, so they all got new books at the start, right?  Then they trade them around.  Let's see...

* **Dave and Gertrude** swap books.
* **Claire and Bob** swap books.
* **Alice and Dave** swap books.
* **Fred and Claire** swap books.
* **Dave and Fred** swap books.
* **Bob and Claire** swap books.
* **Eve and Fred** swap books.

So, who has the book at the end?  I think it's the Odyssey. 

**The answer is (E).**

"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  Let's see...

Gertrude and Bob trade balls.  Then Dave and Bob trade.  Bob and Claire trade.  Dave and Fred trade.  Gertrude and Dave trade.  Bob and Claire trade again.  And finally, Eve and Alice trade. 

So, who has the ball at the end?

* **Bob and Eve switch partners.**
* **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
* **Bob and Fred switch partners.**
* **Bob and Gertrude switch partners.**

"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with balls, right?  They trade them around.  

First, Eve and Fred swap.  Then Dave and Claire swap.  Then Alice and Gertrude swap.  And so on.  

At the end, Fred has the yellow ball. 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with presents, right?  They swap gifts, and I don't know how it works, but I'm gonna guess...

**The answer is (G) pink ball.** 

Why?  Because it's the only one that makes sense! 



"
"Okay, so we got a bunch of people with presents, right?  They swap 'em around.  Let's see...

* **First swap:** Claire and Alice switch presents.

* **Then:** Alice and Dave switch presents.
* **And then:** Fred and Alice switch presents.

"Okay, so here's what I think:

* **First swap:** Bob and Claire switch presents.  
* **Second swap:** Bob and Alice switch presents.

So, who got what?  I think Bob got the white present. 

**The answer is (C).**

So, Claire is on the back now, right?  

**Answer:** (A) 
"
"Okay, so listen:

* Alice is in the middle, right? Like, the middle of the field.
* Bob is the goalie, right? Like, the person who stops the ball from going in the net.
* Claire is on the left, like the side of the field.

Then, they switch places.  Claire is the goalie, Bob is on the left, and then they switch again.  

So, Claire is back on the left, right? 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so Bob and Claire switch partners, then Alice and Bob switch partners, and then Bob and Claire switch partners again.  So, who is Bob dancing with at the end?

B. Jamie
C. Melissa 


 
"
"Okay, so Alice has the blue present, right?  Bob has the pink ball, and Claire has the purple present.

"Okay, so listen:

* Claire starts in the front, like the goal-getter.
* Then, Alice goes to the front too.
* Then, Alice goes to the back, and Bob goes to the front.
* Finally, Bob goes to the back, and Claire goes to the front.

So, Bob is in the front now! 

The answer is **(C).** 



"
"Okay, so Alice has the red one, right?  Then Bob has the black one.  And Claire has the pink one.  

So, Alice and Claire switch gifts.  Then Bob and Alice switch gifts.  And then Alice and Claire switch gifts again.  

So, who has the pink one at the end?  

A.  Bob

"Okay, so listen:

* Alice is the striker, right?
* Bob is the middle guy.
* Claire is on the left.

Then Claire and Bob switch places.  
Then Claire and Alice switch places.
And then Bob and Claire switch places again.

So, at the end, Claire is the striker! 

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so here's what I think:

* **Start:** Alice has blue, Bob has brown, and Claire has white.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Bob's brown, Alice gets Claire's white.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Claire's white, Claire gets Bob's brown.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's brown, Bob gets Alice's blue.

So, Bob ends up with the blue present! 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, so Alice starts with a blue thing.  Then Bob gives her something orange, right?  Then Claire gives her something brown.  So, Alice gets the orange thing from Bob, and then Claire gives her the brown thing.  So, Alice has the orange thing! 

The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so Alice and Claire switch partners, then Alice and Bob switch partners, and then Bob and Claire switch partners.  So, who is dancing with Claire at the end? 

A. Sam
B. Rodrigo
C. Helga 


 
"
"Okay, so Alice starts in the left spot, right?  Then Bob and Alice switch places.  Then Alice and Claire switch places.  And then Bob and Alice switch places again.  So, who's playing where at the end?  

A. Left midfielder
