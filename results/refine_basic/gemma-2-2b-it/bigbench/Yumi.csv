"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  Clue 2 tells us the person with a vase of tulips lives to the left of the guitarist.  Clue 3 tells us the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person with carnations.

We also know there's one house between the flutist and the pianist. 

Let's look at the possibilities:

* **Option A:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 2.
* **Option B:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 3.
* **Option C:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 4.
* **Option D:** The person with a vase of tulips lives in house 5.

We can eliminate options A and B because the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in the same house as the guitarist. 

We can also eliminate option C because the person with a bouquet of lilies lives to the left of the person with carnations. 

Therefore, the only option left is **Option D**.

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know a few things right away:

* **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives in the first house.
* **Clue 8:** The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.

This means the person who likes green is in the first house, and the person who eats kiwis is in the first house.

Now, let's look at the clues that connect the houses:

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
* **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
* **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
* **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
* **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses. 

**The cellist lives in house (B) 2.**

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.  The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.  

Clue 1 tells us the person who likes green lives to the left of the person with the radio.  

We also know the pizza person does not live in house 1.

Putting it all together, the cat lover must live in house 2. 


**Answer: B** 
"
"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I love a good logic puzzle.  

Here's how we'll approach this:

**Step 1:  The Basics**

We need to find the house where the person who only drinks water lives.  Let's start by looking for clues that give us the most direct information about house locations.

**Step 2:  Elimination**

We'll use elimination to narrow down the possibilities.  

**Step 3:  The Clues**

Let's go through each clue and see what we can deduce. 

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
* **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the second house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
* **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
* **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
* **Clue 8:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
* **Clue 9:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the romance book lover.
* **Clue 10:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
* **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
* **Clue 12:** The fantasy book enthusiast and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 13:** There are two houses between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who had pizza lives.
* **Clue 14:** The dog owner and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 16:** There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the romance book lover lives.
* **Clue 17:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 18:** The person who had stew does not live in the fifth house.

**Step 4:  The Solution**

Now, let's see if we can figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the baseball player lives in the second house.  We also know the bird keeper doesn't live in the first house.

"Okay, let's solve this!  

Here's how we can figure out where the person with the television lives:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:** The pianist does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
* **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.

**2.  Create a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the information.  Here's a simple grid to represent the houses and their occupants:

```
| House |  Pianist | Violinist | Percussionist |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
```

**3.  Deduce relationships:**

* **Clue 3 and 6:**  The person wearing high heels and the pianist are next to each other.  The person with the radio is to the left of the person wearing high heels.
* **Clue 4 and 5:** The person wearing running shoes and the percussionist are next to each other. The person wearing boots is to the right of the person eating kiwis.
* **Clue 7:** The person eating oranges is to the left of the person with the television.

**4.  Fill in the grid:**

* **Start with the most direct clues:**  We know the person with the radio is to the left of the person wearing high heels.  We also know the person wearing high heels and the pianist are next to each other.  
* **Continue filling in the grid:**  Use the clues to deduce the remaining information. 

**5.  The answer:**

By carefully analyzing the clues and filling in the grid, you can determine the location of the person with the television.

"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the person with the lilies lives in house 1.  And we know the basketball player is in house 2.  

Clue 1 tells us the person with the radio is to the right of the person eating apples.  Clue 2 tells us the person with the radio is to the right of the violinist. 

Putting it all together, the violinist must be in house 1. 


**Answer:**  House 1

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the tennis player lives in the third house.  The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.  The golfer lives in the fourth house.  We also know that there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who ate spaghetti. 

Let's think about the clues:

* **Clue 5:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
* **Clue 6:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses. 

**The answer is (C) 1** 



"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes doesn't live in house 1.
* **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
* **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

Let's use these clues to figure out the layout!

**Here's what we know:**

* The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1.
* The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.

**Now, let's think about the other clues:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

**Putting it all together:**

* We know the person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. 
* We also know the person who only drinks water lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. 

**Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in house 2.**


**Answer:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know the root beer lover is not in the second house.  We also know the person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house.  This means the root beer lover must be in one of the remaining houses.

We also know the coffee drinker lives to the left of the person eating mangos.  

The only remaining possibility is house 3.

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.  We also know the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.  

Clue 2 tells us the person wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.  

Let's think about the houses.  

* **House 1:**  The person who ate spaghetti lives here.
* **House 2:**  The person who ate fried rice does not live here.
* **House 3:** The person wearing boots lives here.

So, the person wearing loafers must live in house 2. 


**Answer: (A) 2**

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person who likes red lives in the first house, and the person who is eating grapes also lives in the first house.  

Let's look at the clues and see what we can figure out:

* **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
* **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
* **Clue 6:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
* **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.

We can use these clues to deduce the order of the houses and the people's characteristics.

"The person who is eating mangos lives in house **1**. 

**Answer: 1** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.  And we know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person eating kiwis.  This means the person eating kiwis must be in house 1. 

The person who likes blue lives in house 2.

We also know the person who likes apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. 

Now, we need to figure out where the person who likes white lives.  We know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green. 

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3. 


**Answer: (A) 3** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover lives to the right of the person with a rose bouquet.
* **Clue 2:** The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 3:** The person with a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Let's think about this:

* **Clue 1** tells us the root beer lover is to the right of the rose bouquet person. This means the rose bouquet person is in house 1. 
* **Clue 2** tells us the soccer player is left of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader is in house 2. 
* **Clue 3** tells us the gameboy person is left of the mystery book reader. This means the gameboy person is in house 1.


So, the rose bouquet person is in house 1, and the mystery book reader is in house 2. 


**Answer:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in **House 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the dog owner lives in house 3.  

Here's why:

* **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
* **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 


**Answer:** (C) 3 
"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the root beer lover lives in the second house.  We also know the person who likes yellow lives in the third house.  Let's start with that!

Here's a grid to help us:

```
House | Color | Drink
-------|-------|-------
1     |     |     
2     |     |     
3     |     |     
4     |     |     
```

We can use the clues to fill in the rest of the grid. 


Let me know if you'd like to continue!

* **We have clues about the houses and their occupants:**  We know the people in each house have different sports, fruits, and book preferences. 
* **We need to find the location of the history book buff.**

Let's start by looking for the most direct clues.  

**Here's what I'm going to do:**

1. **Identify the most direct clues:**  I'll focus on the clues that give us the most specific information about the houses and their occupants.
2. **Use logic and deduction:** I'll use the clues to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options.
3. **Look for patterns:** I'll look for any repeating information or relationships between the clues.

I'll keep you updated as I work through the puzzle!

"The dog owner lives in house **2**. 

Here's why:

*  Clue 1 tells us the cellist lives to the left of the person with the gameboy.
*  Clue 2 tells us the dog owner does not live in the first house. 

Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the minivan lives in the first house.  That's a good start!  

We also know the gameboy lives in the third house.  

Let's think about the other clues.  The person with the phone lives to the left of the SUV owner.  

Hmm...  The person with the radio lives to the right of the gameboy.  

We can use this information to figure out the rest!

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle!  

Here's how we can figure out where the person with the computer lives:

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
* **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
* **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 8:** The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 9:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
* **Clue 10:** The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
* **Clue 11:** The cricketer lives in the third house.
* **Clue 12:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

Let's start by looking for clues that give us direct information about the location of the computer. 

**Clue 2** and **Clue 4** tell us that the person with the gameboy is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
**Clue 8** tells us that the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
**Clue 4** tells us that the person wearing boots is to the left of the person with the computer.

**Therefore, the person with the computer lives in house C.**

"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

We know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.  The saxophonist is in the fourth house, and the violinist lives next to them.  So, the violinist must be in the third house. 

We also know the romance book lover lives to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.  The history book buff is to the left of the guitarist.  The percussionist is to the left of the mystery book reader. 

Let me know if you'd like to try another puzzle! 


**Answer: (C) 3** 
"
"Okay, let's solve this! 

We know the person with the television lives in the fourth house.  We also know the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.  The person with the phone is not in the second house. 

Let's think about the other clues.  The person wearing boots lives to the left of the person wearing loafers.  This means the person wearing boots is in the house to the left of the person wearing loafers.

"Okay, let's crack this puzzle!  I'm going to use my detective skills to figure out where the percussionist lives. 

First, we need to look for some key clues.  

* **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The flutist lives in the second house.
* **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.

Let's start with these! 

**Now, let's think about the houses and their occupants.  I'll use a grid to help me keep track.**

* **House 1:**  
* **House 2:** 
* **House 3:** 
* **House 4:** 
* **House 5:** 

**I'll use the clues to fill in the grid.  I'll keep track of the information I find.**

**I'll keep you updated as I go!**

"Okay, let's solve this! 

We have a few clues to work with.  Let's start by looking for the most direct information. 

* **Clue 7:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

These clues help us understand the layout of the houses.  

Now, let's see if we can use the other clues to figure out the order of the houses.

"The cellist lives in house 2, and the pianist lives in house 1.  The root beer lover cannot live in house 2.  Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1. 

The answer is **(A) 1**. 
"
"Okay, let's solve this puzzle! 

Here's how we can figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives:

**1.  Start with the most direct clues:**

* **Clue 1:**  Boots and carnations are next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** Tulips are to the left of loafers.
* **Clue 3:** Sandals are not in the fifth house.
* **Clue 4:** Running shoes and lilies are next to each other.
* **Clue 5:** Tulips are to the right of daffodils.
* **Clue 6:** Tulips are not in the fourth house.
* **Clue 7:** Carnations are in the fifth house.
* **Clue 8:** Daffodils and running shoes are next to each other.

**2.  Use the clues to create a grid:**

It's helpful to visualize the houses and their occupants.  You can use a simple grid to keep track of the information.

**3.  Deduce the positions:**

* **Clue 1 and 8:**  This tells us that the person wearing boots and the person with carnations are next to each other. 
* **Clue 2 and 5:** This tells us that the person with tulips is to the left of the person wearing loafers.
* **Clue 3:** This tells us that the person wearing sandals is not in the fifth house.
* **Clue 4:** This tells us that there is a house between the person wearing running shoes and the person with lilies.
* **Clue 5 and 6:** This tells us that the person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils.
* **Clue 7:** This tells us that the person with carnations is in the fifth house.
* **Clue 8:** This tells us that the person with daffodils and the person wearing running shoes are next to each other.

**4.  Solve for the remaining positions:**

By combining the clues, you can deduce the positions of the remaining people.

"Okay, let's break it down! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
* **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
* **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives!

**Here's how it works:**

* Since the person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes live next to each other, and the tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television, we can deduce the following:
    * The person with a television is to the right of the person wearing sandals.
    * The person wearing sandals is to the left of the person eating grapes.
    * The person eating grapes is to the left of the person who drinks tea.

**Now, let's use the information we have to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives!**

* The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
* The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person who drinks tea.

The only way to satisfy all the clues is if the person who is eating kiwis lives in house **1**. 



**Therefore, the answer is (B) 1.**

"Okay, let's solve this! 

Here's what we know:

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.

Let's use these clues to figure out the order of the houses.

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.

So, you're curious about lip piercings and their impact on your dental health?  The short answer is: **yes, they can potentially lead to more expensive dental bills.**

"The Jungle Book is a classic story, but it's important to be aware that it does contain elements that can be seen as problematic.  

**The answer is (B) Yes.** 

Here's why:

* **Stereotypes:** The story relies on stereotypes of Native Americans, often portraying them in a simplistic and negative light.

Ferguson, allowed for racial segregation as long as facilities for different races were considered equal. Wilson supported this idea, believing it was a way to maintain social order and prevent racial conflict.
* **Wilson's views on race were complex.** While he initially opposed racial discrimination, he later became more comfortable with the idea of racial segregation. He believed that racial equality was a matter of states' rights and that the federal government should not interfere with the social order of the South.

"Claire ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve ends up with the brown ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is the benchwarmer, Alice is the right winger, Claire is the right midfielder, Dave is the goalkeeper, and Eve is the cheerleader.

* **Trade 1:** Bob and Alice switch positions. Bob becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.

* **Trade 2:** Dave and Claire switch positions. Dave becomes the right midfielder, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 3:** Alice and Claire switch positions. Alice becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes the right winger.

* **Trade 4:** Eve and Alice switch positions. Eve becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Trade 5:** Dave and Bob switch positions. Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.

**So, the final position for Bob is Goalkeeper!**

The correct answer is **(E).** 
"
"Claire is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **We know:** Alice has purple, Bob has white, Claire has brown, Dave has red, and Eve has yellow.
* **Swaps:**  We need to figure out what happens to each color. 

Let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Dave:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we'll assume they swapped colors.
* **Bob and Eve:** We don't know what they swapped, but we'll assume they swapped colors.
* **Bob and Dave:** We don't know what they swapped, but we'll assume they swapped colors.
* **Claire and Eve:** We don't know what they swapped, but we'll assume they swapped colors.
* **Alice and Dave:** We don't know what they swapped, but we'll assume they swapped colors.

**The key is that the gifts are swapped, and we don't know what they swapped.** 

**Therefore, we can't determine the final gift.** 

**The answer is (None of the above)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance moves play out:

1. Eve and Claire switch partners.
2. Bob and Eve switch partners.
3. Dave and Bob switch partners.
4. Alice and Bob switch partners.
5. Alice and Claire switch partners.

This means that Bob is dancing with Melissa at the end of the dance. 

**The answer is (A).** 



"
"The answer is **(E) black ball**. 

Here's why:

The gifts are swapped in a series of pairs.  Since Claire and Dave swap gifts, and Eve and Dave swap gifts, the gifts are not changed. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Alice has *The Great Gatsby*, Bob has *Catch-22*, Claire has *The Pearl*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  Eve and Claire swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. 

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. 

* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire and Dave swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. 

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. 

* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice and Bob swap books, so we need to figure out what they each have. 

**The key is to note that the trades are done in a circular fashion.**  

**Therefore, Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.** 


**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up dancing with the person who was originally dancing with Alice.  

The answer is **(C) Ophelia**. 



"
"The answer is **(C) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's pink ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.
2. Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's orange ball, Dave gets Bob's pink ball.
3. Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets Claire's black ball, Claire gets Eve's brown present.
4. Bob and Alice swap: Bob gets Alice's red present, Alice gets Bob's pink ball.
5. Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets Claire's black ball, Claire gets Dave's orange ball.

"Eve ends up with the green ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the balls are swapped:

1. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Alice's ball.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Claire's ball.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
5. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Claire's ball.

**So, the final ball distribution is:**

* **Dave:**  Blue ball
* **Eve:** Red ball
* **Bob:** Purple ball
* **Alice:** Green ball
* **Claire:** Black ball

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets the orange ball, and Claire gets the black ball.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets the blue ball, and Bob gets the red ball.
3. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets the black ball, and Dave gets the orange ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets the red ball, and Bob gets the brown ball.
5. **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets the orange ball, and Eve gets the black ball.

So, the final ball Alice has is the **blue ball**. 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Bob ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Alice has Lolita, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has Frankenstein, Dave has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Eve has Ulysses.

2. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's book becomes Alice's, and Alice's book becomes Eve's. This means Eve now has The Great Gatsby and Alice now has Ulysses.

3. **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's book becomes Bob's, and Bob's book becomes Dave's. This means Dave now has Ulysses and Bob now has Frankenstein.

4. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's book becomes Claire's, and Claire's book becomes Eve's. This means Eve now has Hound of the Baskervilles and Claire now has Ulysses.

5. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob's book becomes Alice's, and Alice's book becomes Bob's. This means Bob now has Frankenstein and Alice now has Ulysses.

6. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's book becomes Dave's, and Dave's book becomes Claire's. This means Claire now has Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave now has Ulysses.

**Therefore, Bob ends up with Frankenstein.** 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Claire ends up with Ulysses! 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Alice is playing right winger!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Claire ends up with *Lolita*.  Here's why:

* **The trades happen in a specific order:**  We need to follow the sequence of trades to see who ends up with which book. 

Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob and Eve switch partners, then Claire and Alice switch partners.  Bob and Eve switch partners again, and then Claire and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Claire and Bob switch partners.  

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 

**A) Izzi** 


"
"Dave ends up with the yellow ball!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up with the black ball because the gifts are swapped, not necessarily the colors. 

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Dave ends up with Lolita! 

The correct answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Dave is dancing with Patrick!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Dave and Eve:**  They swap, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's present.
2. **Eve and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Eve's present and Eve gets Claire's present.
3. **Dave and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Dave's present and Dave gets Bob's present.
4. **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's present.
5. **Dave and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Dave's present and Dave gets Alice's present.

**The final gift is the one that Dave received in the last swap.**

"Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring! 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Alice has red, Bob has black, Claire has pink, Dave has orange, and Eve has brown.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

**The answer is:**  We can't determine the final gift Alice has. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Alice and Eve:**  Alice starts with yellow, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow and Alice gets the green.
2. **Bob and Dave:**  Bob starts with orange, Dave starts with purple. They swap, so Dave gets the orange and Bob gets the purple.
3. **Bob and Eve:** Bob gets the green from Eve, and Eve gets the orange from Bob.
4. **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with red, Eve starts with green. They swap, so Eve gets the red and Claire gets the green.
5. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets the orange from Bob, and Alice gets the purple from Dave.

**Dave ends up with the green present.**

The answer is **(B)**.

"Eve ends up with Ulysses! 

The correct answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Alice is now playing **Center Midfielder**.  

The correct answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve it:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob's ball becomes Dave's present, and Dave's ball becomes Bob's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Dave's present, and Dave's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Eve's present.

"Claire is dancing with Bob!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Bob is dancing with Ophelia!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Start:** Bob is center midfielder, Claire is fullback, Dave is striker, Alice is benchwarmer, and Eve is left winger.

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave becomes left winger, Eve becomes striker.
* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes fullback, Claire becomes striker.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes left winger, Dave becomes striker.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes benchwarmer, Alice becomes center midfielder.

**Therefore, Bob is now playing benchwarmer.**

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Claire and Bob:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Bob and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.
* **Claire and Alice:** Swap balls, so they end up with different colors.

**The key is that each swap involves two people trading, and the colors are always changing.**

**Therefore, Dave will have the blue ball at the end.** 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts are changing hands:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now with Alice, and Alice's present is now with Claire.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Bob.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Alice.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Bob.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Dave.

**The final gift is Dave's present.  The answer is (A) yellow present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives her black ball to Eve, and Eve gets Alice's black ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives his yellow ball to Claire, and Claire gets Dave's yellow ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gives his yellow ball to Eve, and Eve gets Dave's yellow ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives her orange ball to Eve, and Eve gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob gives his green ball to Eve, and Eve gets Bob's green ball.

Eve ends up with all the balls that were originally held by the other players. 

So, the answer is **(E) green ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final ball Alice has:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob's ball becomes Alice's, and Alice's ball becomes Bob's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's ball becomes Claire's, and Claire's ball becomes Alice's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve's ball becomes Alice's, and Alice's ball becomes Eve's.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire's ball becomes Bob's, and Bob's ball becomes Claire's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's ball becomes Dave's, and Dave's ball becomes Claire's.

**The answer is (C) black ball.** 



"
"Eve ends up with the orange ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:**  Bob is with Izzi, Claire is with Lola, Dave is with Sam, Eve is with Melissa, and Alice is with Ophelia.

2. **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire is now with Sam, and Bob is with Izzi.

3. **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Sam.

4. **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob is now with Izzi, and Dave is with Sam.

5. **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Sam.

6. **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Sam.

**Therefore, Bob is dancing with Izzi at the end.**

* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Claire his present.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Alice her present.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her present, and Eve gives Alice her present.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his present, and Bob gives Dave his present.

"
"The final ball holder is Dave!  He ends up with the blue ball. 

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Claire is playing right midfielder!  

Here's why:

Let's look at the trades and how they affect Claire's position:

1. **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave moves to left midfielder, Alice moves to right midfielder.
2. **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve moves to right midfielder, Bob moves to left winger.
3. **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire moves to right midfielder, Dave moves to left winger.
4. **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice moves to left winger, Eve moves to right midfielder.
5. **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice moves to fullback, Bob moves to left winger.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

* **Start:** Alice has brown, Bob has black, Claire has green, Dave has purple, and Eve has yellow.

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets the purple and Dave gets the black.

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets the yellow and Eve gets the black.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets the green and Claire gets the purple.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets the black and Bob gets the green.

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice gets the purple and Dave gets the black.

**So, the final gift Alice has is the purple present!**

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"The final position Claire is playing is **Goalkeeper**.  

The correct answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. Eve and Dave swap: Eve starts with a brown ball, and Dave starts with a red ball. They swap, so Eve now has the red ball and Dave has the brown ball.
2. Alice and Dave swap: Alice starts with an orange ball, and Dave now has the brown ball. They swap, so Alice now has the brown ball and Dave has the orange ball.
3. Alice and Claire swap: Alice now has the brown ball, and Claire starts with a yellow ball. They swap, so Claire now has the brown ball and Alice has the yellow ball.
4. Dave and Bob swap: Dave now has the orange ball, and Bob starts with a white ball. They swap, so Dave now has the white ball and Bob has the orange ball.
5. Eve and Dave swap: Eve now has the orange ball, and Dave now has the brown ball.

**So, Claire ends up with the yellow ball!**

"Eve ends up with Dave's book, which was Catch-22. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance! 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) Ulysses**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets Ulysses, Bob gets Frankenstein.
2. Alice and Eve swap: Alice gets Lolita, Eve gets Frankenstein.
3. Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets Lolita, Eve gets Ulysses.
4. Dave and Bob swap: Dave gets The Pearl, Bob gets Ulysses.
5. Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets The Odyssey, Claire gets Ulysses.

This means that Claire ends up with Ulysses. 



"
"Eve ends up with Catch-22! 

The correct answer is (C). 
"
"Claire is dancing with Sam!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Dave is playing Left Winger!  

The answer is (B). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob starts with a black ball.  Here's how the swaps go:

* **Dave and Bob:**  Dave starts with purple, Bob starts with black. They swap, so Bob now has purple and Dave has black.
* **Alice and Dave:**  Dave now has black, Alice has purple. They swap, so Alice now has black and Dave has purple.
* **Bob and Eve:**  Bob now has purple, Eve has green. They swap, so Eve now has purple and Bob has green.
* **Dave and Claire:**  Dave now has purple, Claire has yellow. They swap, so Claire now has purple and Dave has yellow.
* **Alice and Eve:**  Alice now has purple, Eve has green. They swap, so Eve now has purple and Alice has green.

**So, Bob ends up with the green present!**

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"The final gift is the orange ball! 

Here's why:

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This leaves Dave with a white present and Claire with a black ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This leaves Dave with an orange ball and Eve with a white present.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This leaves Alice with a black ball and Claire with an orange ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This leaves Eve with a green present and Alice with a black ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This leaves Bob with a green present and Dave with an orange ball. 



 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:**
   * Bob: Frankenstein
   * Dave: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Claire: Ulysses
   * Alice: The Pearl
   * Eve: Moby Dick

2. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means they both get each other's books. 
   * Bob gets Dave's book (Hound of the Baskervilles)
   * Dave gets Bob's book (Frankenstein)

3. **Bob and Claire swap:**
   * Bob gets Claire's book (Ulysses)
   * Claire gets Bob's book (Frankenstein)

4. **Dave and Claire swap:**
   * Dave gets Claire's book (Ulysses)
   * Claire gets Dave's book (Hound of the Baskervilles)

5. **Claire and Bob swap:**
   * Claire gets Bob's book (Frankenstein)
   * Bob gets Claire's book (Ulysses)

6. **Alice and Eve swap:**
   * Alice gets Eve's book (Moby Dick)
   * Eve gets Alice's book (The Pearl)

**Therefore, Bob ends up with Ulysses.**

**Answer: (E)** 



"
"The answer is **(C) Patrick**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the dance changes:

1. Eve and Bob switch partners.
2. Alice and Bob switch partners.
3. Dave and Eve switch partners.
4. Eve and Claire switch partners.
5. Alice and Claire switch partners.

"Eve is dancing with Patrick!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **We know:**  We have a starting set of colors: pink, brown, green, red, and purple.
* **Swaps:**  We have a series of swaps happening. 
* **The goal:** We need to figure out what color Dave ends up with.

**Let's think about the swaps:**

* **Claire and Bob:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Claire and Dave:**  We don't know what they swapped, but the colors are now mixed up.
* **Bob and Alice:**  We don't know what they swapped, but the colors are now mixed up.
* **Alice and Eve:**  We don't know what they swapped, but the colors are now mixed up.
* **Dave and Alice:**  We don't know what they swapped, but the colors are now mixed up.

**The key is that the gifts are swapped, and we don't know what they swapped.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Alice has Moby Dick, Bob has Catch-22, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave has Ulysses, and Eve has The Odyssey.

2. **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they switch books.  So now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

3. **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch books again.  So now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

4. **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books.  So now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

5. **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch books.  So now we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: The Odyssey

**Dave ends up with Ulysses.**

**The answer is (D).**

"The final gift is the one that was originally Eve's.  So the answer is **(D) black ball**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Bob and Alice:**  Bob starts with a white present, and Alice starts with a green present. They swap, so the white present goes to Alice and the green present goes to Bob.
2. **Alice and Eve:** Alice now has the green present, and Eve has the yellow present. They swap, so the yellow present goes to Alice and the green present goes to Eve.
3. **Claire and Eve:** Claire has the black ball, and Eve has the yellow present. They swap, so the yellow present goes to Claire and the black ball goes to Eve.
4. **Alice and Dave:** Alice now has the green present, and Dave has the orange ball. They swap, so the orange ball goes to Alice and the green present goes to Dave.
5. **Bob and Eve:** Bob now has the white present, and Eve has the yellow present. They swap, so the yellow present goes to Bob and the white present goes to Eve.

**So, Claire ends up with the yellow present!** 


The answer is **(D)**.

   * Eve: Frankenstein

2. **Claire and Dave swap:**  This leaves us with:

   * Bob: Moby Dick
   * Alice: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Eve: Frankenstein

3. **Alice and Eve swap:** This leaves us with:

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  This means Dave gets a new gift, and Bob gets a new gift.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.

**The key is that each swap involves two people exchanging gifts.**  

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Dave and Claire:**  They swap, so Dave now has Claire's gift.
* **Dave and Bob:**  They swap, so Dave now has Bob's gift.
* **Claire and Eve:**  They swap, so Claire now has Eve's gift.

"Eve ends up with the blue ball!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob starts with a yellow ball, Alice starts with an orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the yellow ball. 

Eve starts with a white ball, Alice gets the yellow ball. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the white ball.

Bob and Dave swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Dave gets the orange ball.

Bob and Alice swap again, so Bob gets the orange ball and Alice gets the blue ball.

Finally, Claire and Bob swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Bob gets the red ball. 

So, Bob has the red ball! 


The answer is **(D).**

3. Claire and Bob swap, Bob gets the pink ball, Claire gets the blue ball.
4. Eve and Bob swap, Bob gets the white ball, Eve gets the blue ball.
5. Alice and Dave swap, Dave gets the orange ball, Alice gets the pink ball.

Bob ends up with the white ball.

1. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gets Bob's book, Alice gets Eve's book.
2. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, Bob gets Alice's book.
3. **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Bob's book, Bob gets Claire's book.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gets Dave's book, Dave gets Eve's book.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out Claire's book:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: Ulysses
    * Dave: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Eve: The Odyssey

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This changes their books, but we don't know the final order.

**The key is to understand that the swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

**The only way to determine Claire's book is to look at the final order.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

* **Start:** Alice has Moby Dick, Bob has Lolita, Claire has The Great Gatsby, Dave has Catch-22, and Eve has Ulysses.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means they switch books, so we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: Lolita
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: The Great Gatsby
    * Eve: Ulysses

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they switch books again, so we have:
    * Alice: Moby Dick
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means they switch books, so we have:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they switch books again, so we have:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means they switch books, so we have:
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Ulysses
    * Claire: Catch-22
    * Dave: Moby Dick
    * Eve: Lolita

**Therefore, Bob has Ulysses at the end of the semester.**

**Answer: (E)** 



"
"Eve gets the pink ball!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Bob is dancing with Claire at the end of the dance.  The answer is **(C) Jamie**. 
"
"Dave is dancing with Izzi! 

The answer is (C). 
"
"The answer is **(E) red present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
2. **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Dave's.

"Eve gets the blue present!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Claire is playing right winger!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Dave has Ulysses, Alice has Catch-22, Bob has Moby Dick, Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve has The Great Gatsby.

2. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

3. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

5. **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

6. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means they trade books, so we need to figure out who gets which book.

**The final answer is (E) Ulysses.**

1. **Dave starts with Rodrigo.**
2. **Claire and Bob switch partners.**
3. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
4. **Claire and Bob switch partners again.**
5. **Eve and Dave switch partners.**

"The answer is **(B) Patrick**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the dance moves:

1. **Start:** Claire - Sam, Dave - Patrick, Alice - Izzi, Bob - Lola, Eve - Jamie

2. **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire - Jamie, Eve - Sam

3. **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave - Izzi, Alice - Sam

4. **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire - Patrick, Dave - Izzi

5. **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire - Lola, Alice - Patrick 


Let me know if you have any other dance-related questions! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is goalkeeper, Bob is striker, Claire is cheerleader, Dave is center midfielder, and Eve is right midfielder.

2. **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Dave becomes right midfielder.

3. **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes striker, Bob becomes center midfielder.

4. **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes cheerleader, Claire becomes center midfielder.

5. **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes striker, Bob becomes center midfielder.

6. **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes striker, Bob becomes center midfielder.

**Therefore, Bob is now playing center midfielder. Alice is playing striker.** 


The answer is **(D) striker**. 
"

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the game involves pairs of players swapping balls.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's ball is now Dave's, and Dave's ball is now Claire's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's ball is now Bob's, and Bob's ball is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means Claire's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Claire's.

The final ball holder is Bob.  

**The answer is (A) yellow ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the book trades work:

1. **Initial Ownership:**
   * Alice: Lolita
   * Bob: The Great Gatsby
   * Claire: Ulysses
   * Dave: The Fellowship of the Ring
   * Eve: The Odyssey

2. **Bob and Alice Swap:**  This means Bob's book (The Great Gatsby) is now Alice's book.
3. **Eve and Claire Swap:** This means Eve's book (The Odyssey) is now Claire's book.
4. **Alice and Bob Swap:** This means Alice's book (Lolita) is now Bob's book.
5. **Dave and Eve Swap:** This means Dave's book (The Fellowship of the Ring) is now Eve's book.
6. **Claire and Eve Swap:** This means Claire's book (Ulysses) is now Eve's book.

**Therefore, at the end of the semester, Alice has The Great Gatsby.**

"The answer is **(B) white present**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob (white) + Alice (green) =  Alice (green) gets the white present.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice (green) + Eve (yellow) = Eve (yellow) gets the green present.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire (black) + Eve (yellow) = Eve (yellow) gets the black ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice (green) + Dave (orange) = Dave (orange) gets the green present.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob (white) + Eve (yellow) = Eve (yellow) gets the white present. 



Let me know if you have any other questions! 
"
"Dave is dancing with Helga!  

The answer is **(D)**.

"Let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Alice starts with The Pearl.**
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Alice and Bob swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means they both traded books.
* **Eve and Alice swap books.** This means they both traded books.

**Therefore, Alice has Catch-22 at the end.** 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"The final ball Dave ends up with is the brown ball. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Bob is now playing **Goalkeeper**. 

The correct answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Eve is playing Right Winger! 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as the goalkeeper.  Then, she and Claire switch positions.  Alice becomes the right winger, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.  

Next, Alice and Bob switch positions. Alice becomes the left midfielder, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.

Then, Dave and Bob switch positions. Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the striker.

Bob and Eve switch positions. Bob becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the right winger.

Finally, Dave and Eve switch positions. Dave becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the striker.

So, Alice is now the center midfielder! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"The answer is **(B).** 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice:**  Claire starts with a pink ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a brown ball.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
5. **Eve and Claire:** Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.

Dave ends up with the orange ball. 



"
"Let's figure this out! 

Here's how the trades work:

1. **Start:** Alice has Lolita, Bob has The Great Gatsby, Claire has Ulysses, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring, and Eve has The Odyssey.

2. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Lolita, and Alice gets The Great Gatsby.

3. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Ulysses, and Claire gets The Odyssey.

4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets The Great Gatsby, and Bob gets Lolita.

5. **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets The Odyssey, and Eve gets The Fellowship of the Ring.

6. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, and Eve gets Ulysses.

**Therefore, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring at the end.** 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Eve ends up with the blue ball!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Ophelia. Then, Claire and Dave switch partners, so Claire is now with Rodrigo.  Eve and Alice switch partners, so Eve is now with Dave. 

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Melissa. 

The answer is **(E)**.

"Eve is the striker!  

The final position is **(E) striker**.

"The final gift Alice has is the orange ball! 

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

* **Alice and Claire:**  Alice starts with red, Claire starts with blue. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob starts with white, Alice starts with red. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with pink, Alice starts with red. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with blue, Dave starts with brown. After swapping, they end up with each other's colors.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. Eve and Bob switch partners.
2. Dave and Alice switch partners.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners.
4. Eve and Claire switch partners.
5. Alice and Bob switch partners.

This means that Dave is now dancing with Alice. 

So the answer is **(A) Sam.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is striker, Bob is fullback, Claire is left winger, Dave is center midfielder, and Eve is benchwarmer.

2. **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire moves to fullback, Bob moves to left winger.

3. **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave moves to left winger, Claire moves to center midfielder.

4. **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice moves to fullback, Bob moves to striker.

5. **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve moves to center midfielder, Dave moves to benchwarmer.

6. **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice moves to center midfielder, Dave moves to striker.

**Therefore, Bob is now playing striker.** 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"The answer is **(B) Ulysses**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Initial Ownership:**
   * Alice: The Pearl
   * Bob: Frankenstein
   * Claire: Ulysses
   * Dave: Hound of the Baskervilles
   * Eve: Moby Dick

2. **Bob and Dave Swap:**  This leaves Bob with Ulysses and Dave with Frankenstein.
3. **Bob and Claire Swap:** This leaves Bob with Hound of the Baskervilles and Claire with Ulysses.
4. **Dave and Claire Swap:** This leaves Dave with Moby Dick and Claire with Hound of the Baskervilles.
5. **Claire and Bob Swap:** This leaves Claire with Frankenstein and Bob with Moby Dick.
6. **Alice and Eve Swap:** This leaves Alice with Moby Dick and Eve with Frankenstein. 



Let me know if you have any other book-related puzzles! 📚 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Claire. This means Claire now has the purple present.
2. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Claire. This means Bob now has the purple present.
3. **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Dave. This means Alice now has the pink ball.
4. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve's present goes to Dave, and Dave's present goes to Eve. This means Dave now has the green present.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Alice. This means Bob now has the green present.

So the answer is **(B) green present.** 



"
"The answer is **(B) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Bob and Eve swap:  Bob starts with an orange ball, Eve starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Eve now has an orange ball and Bob has a brown ball.
2. Eve and Dave swap: Eve now has an orange ball, Dave now has a brown ball.
3. Dave and Alice swap: Dave now has a brown ball, Alice now has a green ball.
4. Alice and Claire swap: Alice now has a green ball, Claire now has a brown ball.
5. Bob and Claire swap: Bob now has a brown ball, Claire now has a green ball.

"Eve is playing right winger!  

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Bob is dancing with Melissa! 

The answer is (C). 
"
"Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring! 

The correct answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift swapping works:

* Eve and Claire swap: This doesn't change the colors.
* Claire and Bob swap: This swaps the colors.
* Bob and Alice swap: This swaps the colors again.
* Eve and Alice swap: This swaps the colors again.
* Bob and Dave swap: This swaps the colors again.

The final gift Bob has is the color that was in the last swap, which is the green present.

**Answer: (E) green present.** 



"
"Eve ends up with Ulysses!  

Here's why:

* **The trades:**  We need to see how the books move around. 
* **Eve's book:**  Eve's book is the one that gets passed around the most. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo! 

The answer is (A). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to figure out who has the gift at the end.  Here's how we can do that:

* **Bob and Claire Swap:**  This swaps their gifts, so we don't know who has what.
* **Dave and Eve Swap:** This swaps their gifts, so we don't know who has what.
* **Bob and Alice Swap:** This swaps their gifts, so we don't know who has what.
* **Eve and Bob Swap:** This swaps their gifts, so we don't know who has what.
* **Dave and Bob Swap:** This swaps their gifts, so we don't know who has what.

**The key is that we don't know who has what after each swap.**  We can't determine the final gift based on the information given.

"Eve is dancing with Helga!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Bob swap, so Eve gets Bob's blue ball and Bob gets Eve's green ball. 

Then, Dave and Claire swap, so Dave gets Claire's brown ball and Claire gets Dave's red ball.

Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's blue ball and Eve gets Alice's yellow ball.

Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Alice's yellow ball.

Finally, Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Bob's yellow ball.

So, the final ball is Bob's blue ball. 


The answer is **(E) blue ball.** 
"
"Claire is dancing with Sam!  

The answer is **(D).** 
"
"Eve ends up with Rodrigo!  

The correct answer is **(A) Rodrigo**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve it:

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes the colors again.

**The final gift Bob has is the (B) black ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(B) purple present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Dave swap:  Alice gets Dave's purple present.
2. Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets Dave's yellow present.
3. Dave and Eve swap: Eve gets Dave's pink present.
4. Bob and Dave swap: Dave gets Bob's green present.
5. Dave and Claire swap: Claire gets Dave's yellow present. 


Claire ends up with the purple present. 



"
"Bob ends up with the brown ball!  

The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

**The key is to see that each swap results in a new ball being held by each player.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (E) yellow ball.** 



"
"The answer is **(B) green ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets Green, Claire gets Purple
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets Purple, Bob gets Green
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Green, Bob gets Purple
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Blue, Alice gets Purple

1. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
2. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
3. **Alice and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**

This means that Bob is dancing with someone new at the end of the dance.

"The final gift Alice has is the purple present. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gifts change hands:

1. **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with an orange ball, and Alice starts with purple. They swap, so Eve gets the purple and Alice gets the orange ball.
2. **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Bob gets the blue present and Dave gets the brown present.
3. **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so Bob gets the purple present and Alice gets the blue present.
4. **Claire and Eve:** They swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is in the center, Bob is the fullback, Claire is the goalkeeper, Dave is the left winger, and Eve is the right winger.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who ends up with the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with them.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.

"Fred is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"The final dance partner for Alice is Ophelia! 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **Start:** We know Dave has a black ball.
* **Bob and Eve Swap:**  This changes Bob's present to something else, and Eve's present to something else.
* **Claire and Gertrude Swap:** This changes Claire's present to something else, and Gertrude's present to something else.
* **Gertrude and Dave Swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something else, and Dave's present to something else.
* **Eve and Fred Swap:** This changes Eve's present to something else, and Fred's present to something else.
* **Fred and Bob Swap:** This changes Fred's present to something else, and Bob's present to something else.
* **Claire and Alice Swap:** This changes Claire's present to something else, and Alice's present to something else.
* **Fred and Bob Swap:** This changes Fred's present to something else, and Bob's present to something else.

**The key is to note that the gifts are swapped, but the colors don't change.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (F) black ball.** 



"
"Fred is the left midfielder!  

The correct answer is **(F) left midfielder**. 
"
"Claire is now dancing with Jamie!  The answer is (E). 
"
"Gertrude ends up playing center midfielder!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Eve ends up with the green ball.  

The answer is **(E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the gifts are swapped in pairs.  Let's see how the colors change hands:

* **Claire and Gertrude:**  Claire gets a green present, Gertrude gets an orange present.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred gets an orange present, Gertrude gets a green present.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets a black present, Eve gets a green present.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gets a green present, Eve gets a black present.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets a black present, Alice gets a green present.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gets a green present, Alice gets a black present.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets a green present, Dave gets a black present.

**Therefore, Bob has the green present!**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Dave and Claire switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Claire and Fred switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Fred and Alice switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** This means they are now dancing with different people.

**The final answer is (E) Melissa.**

"The answer is **(C) purple ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Dave swap, Dave gets a black ball.
2. Gertrude and Claire swap, Gertrude gets a blue ball.
3. Dave and Bob swap, Dave gets a brown ball.
4. Claire and Gertrude swap, Claire gets a yellow ball.
5. Alice and Fred swap, Alice gets a black ball.
6. Bob and Alice swap, Bob gets a pink ball.
7. Eve and Bob swap, Eve gets a purple ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see which books are swapped and who swaps with whom. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Alice and Bob:** They swap books.
2. **Fred and Claire:** They swap books.
3. **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap books.
4. **Bob and Alice:** They swap books.
5. **Bob and Claire:** They swap books.
6. **Dave and Alice:** They swap books.
7. **Bob and Eve:** They swap books.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

**The answer is (E) Frankenstein.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  Everyone gets a new book to begin with.
* **The swaps:**  We need to see how the swaps affect the books. 

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Claire's book.
3. **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Eve's book.
5. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Fred's book.
6. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Dave's book.
7. **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Fred's book.

**Fred ends up with Frankenstein.** 



 
"
"The answer is **(E) blue ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Bob and Gertrude:**  Bob gives his pink ball to Gertrude, who gives her pink ball to Bob.
2. **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives his green ball to Bob, who gives his pink ball to Dave.
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Gertrude, who gives her yellow ball to Eve.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his pink ball to Alice, who gives her orange ball to Bob.
5. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives her yellow ball to Fred, who gives his red ball to Eve.
6. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives her brown ball to Dave, who gives his green ball to Claire.

The final ball that Fred holds is the blue ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Dave swap balls, then Eve and Fred swap balls, and then Eve and Dave swap balls again.  This means Eve is getting a new ball each time.  

Let's look at the final swap: Alice and Dave swap.  

**The answer is (E) white ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial ownership:**  We know each person got a new book at the beginning of the semester. 
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are exchanged. 
* **Identify the final book:**  We need to figure out who has the book that Alice ends up with.

1. **Gertrude and Eve:**  Gertrude gives Eve her pink ball, and Eve gives Gertrude her red ball.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his purple ball, and Bob gives Fred his black ball.
3. **Fred and Eve:** Fred gives Eve her purple ball, and Eve gives Fred her red ball.
4. **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gives Gertrude her orange ball, and Gertrude gives Alice her pink ball.

"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps! 

We know that Alice starts with a brown present.  Let's see how the swaps change things:

* **Eve and Fred swap:**  This changes the black ball to a pink ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This changes the green present to a yellow present.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This changes the purple present to a blue present.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This changes the pink ball to a purple present.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes the yellow present to a pink present.

"The answer is **(C) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Eve and Dave swap balls.
2. Gertrude and Eve swap balls.
3. Bob and Fred swap balls.
4. Claire and Fred swap balls.
5. Alice and Claire swap balls.
6. Eve and Fred swap balls.
7. Eve and Dave swap balls.

The final ball distribution is:

* Alice: Green ball
* Bob: Brown ball
* Claire: Orange ball
* Dave: Red ball
* Eve: Blue ball
* Fred: Black ball
* Gertrude: Yellow ball 



"
"Bob is playing striker!  He started as center midfielder and then traded with Eve, so he is now playing striker. 

The answer is (D). 
"
"Claire is dancing with Melissa!  

The answer is (A).

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:**  We know Alice has a green present.
* **Gertrude and Eve:**  They swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Eve's.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Bob's.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's present and Gertrude gets Fred's.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's present and Bob gets Dave's.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's present and Alice gets Bob's.
* **Dave and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Dave's present and Dave gets Claire's.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Claire's present and Claire gets Alice's.

**The answer is (E) purple.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred starts with a green present.  He then gets an orange present from Eve.  So Fred's present is now an orange ball. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Gertrude ends up with the brown ball!  The answer is (F).

"Fred is playing fullback!  

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  Claire gets the orange ball, and Gertrude gets the pink ball.
2. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets the orange ball, and Alice gets the pink ball.
3. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets the pink ball, and Claire gets the orange ball.
4. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice gets the orange ball, and Dave gets the pink ball.
5. **Fred and Dave swap:** Fred gets the pink ball, and Dave gets the orange ball.
6. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets the orange ball, and Dave gets the pink ball.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets the orange ball, and Eve gets the pink ball.

**Therefore, Fred has the orange ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to see who ends up with which ball.  

* Eve and Dave swap, so Eve gets Dave's blue ball and Dave gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Fred swap, so Eve gets Fred's white ball and Fred gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Dave swap again, so Eve gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Eve's blue ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's purple ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's green ball and Alice gets Bob's purple ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's pink ball and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.
* Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's red ball and Dave gets Alice's purple ball.

Fred ends up with the white ball! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the answer:

* **Initial Ownership:**
    * Alice: The Great Gatsby
    * Bob: Catch-22
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Ulysses
    * Eve: Frankenstein
    * Fred: The Pearl
    * Gertrude: The Odyssey

* **Swaps:**
    * Fred and Alice swap books.
    * Gertrude and Eve swap books.
    * Alice and Eve swap books.
    * Dave and Gertrude swap books.
    * Gertrude and Claire swap books.
    * Alice and Claire swap books.
    * Dave and Bob swap books.

* **The Final Swap:**
    * Alice is the only one who has a book that has been swapped with everyone else. 

**Therefore, the answer is (E) Catch-22.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book to start. 
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see who swapped with whom. 
* **The final book:**  We need to figure out who has the book that was swapped with Bob.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the book at the end:

* **Start:**  We know everyone gets a new book to begin with.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track the swaps.  
* **The End:**  We need to figure out who has the book that was originally Dave's.

"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the colors will change hands:

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap, so Bob's ball becomes Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap, so Alice's ball becomes Claire's, and vice versa.
* **Bob and Fred:** They swap, so Bob's ball becomes Fred's, and vice versa.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Claire's ball becomes Fred's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so Alice's ball becomes Gertrude's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap, so Alice's ball becomes Dave's, and vice versa.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Dave's ball becomes Eve's, and vice versa.

"Eve is playing goalkeeper!  

Here's why:

So the answer is **(B)**. 
"

The other players swap positions, but Bob stays as the cheerleader. 

So the answer is **(B) cheerleader**.

* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Eve and Gertrude switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Eve and Dave switch partners.
* Bob and Alice switch partners.
* Bob and Fred switch partners.
* Bob and Eve switch partners.

Let's see who Dave ends up with! 


**Answer:** (A) Rodrigo 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Red
    * Bob: Orange
    * Claire: Pink
    * Dave: Purple
    * Eve: Brown
    * Fred: Black
    * Gertrude: Green

* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve's present becomes Gertrude's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice's present becomes Dave's, and vice versa.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Fred's present becomes Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  Bob's present becomes Fred's, and vice versa.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:**  Gertrude's present becomes Claire's, and vice versa.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave's present becomes Claire's, and vice versa.

**The final gift Alice has is the (C) red present.** 



"
"Claire is playing left winger! 

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring!  

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see where Eve ends up:

* **Initial Books:** Everyone starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:** The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who gets which book. 

Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Alice and Bob:**  Alice starts with Catch-22, Bob starts with Frankenstein.
2. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude starts with The Odyssey, Claire starts with Ulysses.
3. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.
4. **Alice and Fred:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
5. **Dave and Eve:** Dave starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Eve starts with Moby Dick.
6. **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with Ulysses, Bob starts with Frankenstein.
7. **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with Moby Dick, Bob starts with Frankenstein.

**Analyzing the swaps:**

* **Eve's book:** Eve ends up with the book she received in the last swap. 

**Therefore, Eve has The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:**  Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Claire and Bob:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Alice and Dave:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Alice and Eve:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap books, so they both end up with a different book.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Gertrude swapped gifts, and then Fred and Eve did too.  This means that Fred and Eve must have received each other's gifts.  

Then, Bob and Claire swapped gifts, and Claire and Gertrude swapped gifts.  This means that Bob and Claire must have received each other's gifts. 

Finally, Alice and Bob swapped gifts.  

So, the answer is **(F) red present**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial distribution:**  Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *Lolita*, and so on.
* **We need to track the swaps:**  Alice and Eve swap, Bob and Alice swap, Dave and Eve swap, and so on. 
* **The key is to keep track of who gets which book after each swap.**

Let me know if you'd like me to walk through the swaps step-by-step!

"The answer is **(G) white ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's ball.
2. Fred and Alice swap, so Alice gets Fred's ball.
3. Alice and Claire swap, so Claire gets Alice's ball.
4. Bob and Dave swap, so Dave gets Bob's ball.
5. Fred and Eve swap, so Eve gets Fred's ball.
6. Gertrude and Fred swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's ball.
7. Gertrude and Bob swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's ball. 


Bob now has the white ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has what at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: White
    * Bob: Black
    * Claire: Pink
    * Dave: Orange
    * Eve: Purple
    * Fred: Yellow
    * Gertrude: Blue

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This changes Dave's present to something Fred has, and Fred's present to something Dave has. 
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes Bob's present to something Fred has, and Fred's present to something Bob has.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something Dave has, and Dave's present to something Gertrude has.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Claire has, and Claire's present to something Dave has.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Eve has, and Eve's present to something Dave has.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This changes Claire's present to something Bob has, and Bob's present to something Claire has.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Alice has, and Alice's present to something Dave has.

**The final gift Gertrude has is the one that was originally Fred's.** 


**Answer:** (F) blue present. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred ends up with the black ball because of the following sequence of swaps:

1. Eve and Gertrude swap: Eve gets a blue ball, Gertrude gets a black ball.
2. Fred and Bob swap: Fred gets an orange ball, Bob gets a yellow ball.
3. Fred and Claire swap: Fred gets a white ball, Claire gets an orange ball.
4. Eve and Fred swap: Eve gets an orange ball, Fred gets a black ball.
5. Fred and Claire swap: Fred gets a pink ball, Claire gets a white ball.
6. Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets an orange ball, Bob gets a green ball.
7. Dave and Gertrude swap: Dave gets a black ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.

Let me know if you'd like to play another game! 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out Fred's present:

* **Start:** We know Fred has a yellow present.
* **Bob and Eve:**  Bob's orange ball becomes Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave's red present becomes Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave's red present becomes Fred's yellow present.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice's green present becomes Fred's yellow present.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire's pink ball becomes Bob's orange ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire's pink ball becomes Eve's black ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire's pink ball becomes Gertrude's blue present.

**Fred's Present:**  Fred's present was originally Claire's pink ball. 

**Answer:** (B) pink ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the gifts are swapped in pairs.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave's present is now Fred's, and Fred's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Alice's.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Alice's.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Fred's.

The final gift is the one that was originally Fred's. 

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"The answer is **(C) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps and who ends up with which ball:

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve starts with a white ball and Gertrude starts with a blue ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Bob has a purple ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob now has a purple ball, and Dave has a pink ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred now has a brown ball, and Claire has a black ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Gertrude has a white ball.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Alice now has an orange ball, and Fred has a brown ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Dave now has a pink ball, and Eve has a blue ball.

"The answer is **(C) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and how they affect the books each person has:

* **Initial:**  Everyone starts with a new book.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This changes the books Bob and Fred have.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes the books Dave and Alice have.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** This changes the books Gertrude and Claire have.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes the books Bob and Claire have.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This changes the books Alice and Claire have.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes the books Eve and Alice have.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes the books Alice and Gertrude have.

After all these swaps, Claire ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Alice starts with Izzi, and we know there are a lot of partner swaps.  Let's see...

* **Fred and Eve switch:** Fred-Ophelia, Eve-Karl
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob-Claire, Dave-Sam
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve-Karl, Alice-Sam
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob-Melissa, Claire-Sam
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve-Karl, Alice-Sam
* **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude-Lola, Fred-Ophelia
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob-Melissa, Dave-Sam

**So, the final dance partner for Alice is Sam!** 


The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final book Dave has:

1. **Start with the initial list:**  We know everyone starts with a new book.

2. **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are swapped around. 

3. **Identify the key swaps:**  We need to pay attention to which books are swapped and who swaps them.

4. **Analyze the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are exchanged.

5. **The final answer:**  Dave ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to figure out who has what at the end.  Here's how we can do it:

* **Start with the initial state:**
    * Alice: Green
    * Bob: Orange
    * Claire: Black
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Red
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Pink

* **Fred and Eve Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Fred and Eve now have each other's gifts.

* **Bob and Gertrude Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Bob and Gertrude now have each other's gifts.

* **Alice and Claire Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Claire now have each other's gifts.

* **Dave and Fred Swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Fred now have each other's gifts.

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Fred has a white present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This changes Gertrude's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Claire's.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes Eve's present to Claire's, and Claire's present to Eve's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Gertrude's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to Bob's, and Bob's present to Fred's.

**Fred's present at the end will be the one that was originally Bob's.** 

**The answer is (F) yellow.**

* **Start:**  We know the initial colors of each person's gift.
* **Alice and Dave:**  Alice's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Dave:**  Claire's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Gertrude:**  Fred's gift is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's gift is now Fred's.

* **Dave and Bob:**  Dave's gift is now Bob's, and Bob's gift is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Dave:**  Gertrude's gift is now Dave's, and Dave's gift is now Gertrude's.

**The answer is (C) black ball.** 



"
"Fred is playing Left Winger! 

The correct answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:** Each person gets a new book to begin with.
* **The swaps:** We need to track who gets which book after each swap.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Alice and Claire:** Alice starts with Catch-22, Claire starts with Lolita.
2. **Bob and Dave:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Dave and Fred:** Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.
4. **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with The Pearl, Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.

6. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with The Great Gatsby, Gertrude starts with Frankenstein.
7. **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The Final Swap:** Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring. 

**Therefore, the answer is (F).**

* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Ulysses, Claire gets Frankenstein.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets Frankenstein, Alice gets The Pearl.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Moby Dick, Dave gets The Pearl.

**Final Answer:** Claire has **(A) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Bob and Dave switch partners.**
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
4. **Alice and Gertrude switch partners.**
5. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
6. **Bob and Fred switch partners.**

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who ends up with which ball:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who ends up with which ball.

Let's analyze the swaps:

1. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives her ball to Alice.
2. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives her ball to Claire.
3. **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives her ball to Gertrude.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his ball to Alice.
5. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives her ball to Alice.
6. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives his ball to Alice.
7. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives his ball to Fred.

**The key is to see who ends up with the ball after each swap.**

* **Alice** ends up with the ball from each swap. 
* **Claire** ends up with the ball from the swap with Eve and Gertrude. 

**Therefore, Claire ends up with the ball that was originally held by Eve.** 

**Answer:** (B) blue ball. 



"
"Fred ends up with The Pearl!  

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred starts with *The Great Gatsby*.
2. Fred and Bob swap, so Fred now has Bob's book.
3. Bob and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
4. Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
5. Alice and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.
6. Claire and Gertrude swap, so Fred now has Gertrude's book.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as a cheerleader.  Here's what we know:

* Bob and Alice swap positions. Bob becomes the cheerleader, and Alice becomes the right midfielder.
* Claire and Fred swap positions. Claire becomes the striker, and Fred becomes the right winger.
* Gertrude and Fred swap positions. Gertrude becomes the striker, and Fred becomes the right midfielder.
* Eve and Fred swap positions. Eve becomes the striker, and Fred becomes the fullback.
* Alice and Gertrude swap positions. Alice becomes the fullback, and Gertrude becomes the striker.
* Gertrude and Dave swap positions. Gertrude becomes the center midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* Bob and Dave swap positions. Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Dave becomes the center midfielder.

So, at the end of the match, Alice is playing **fullback**.

Here's why:

Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Initial Purchases:** Each person gets a new book.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap books.
3. **Eve and Dave:** Swap books.
4. **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap books.
5. **Eve and Alice:** Swap books.
6. **Fred and Eve:** Swap books.
7. **Alice and Bob:** Swap books.
8. **Claire and Alice:** Swap books.

Alice's book is the one that is swapped the most. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Dave and Fred swap:**  Dave gets Fred's ball, and Fred gets Dave's ball.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Claire's ball.
3. **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's ball, and Bob gets Eve's ball.
4. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Gertrude's ball.
5. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets Gertrude's ball, and Gertrude gets Alice's ball.
6. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Claire's ball, and Claire gets Bob's ball.
7. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Bob's ball.

**The final ball that Dave has is the ball that was originally Bob's ball.** 

**The answer is (C) blue ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Trades:**  We need to see how the colors change hands.

Let's look at the trades:

1. **Alice-Fred:** Alice gives Fred her blue ball, Fred gets Alice's blue ball.
2. **Dave-Fred:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
3. **Eve-Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
4. **Dave-Claire:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
5. **Claire-Bob:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.
6. **Dave-Alice:** Dave gives Alice her blue ball, Alice gets Dave's blue ball.
7. **Bob-Fred:** Bob gives Fred his orange ball, Fred gets Bob's orange ball.

**Fred ends up with the white ball.**

"Fred ends up with Ulysses!  

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the pink ball:

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives up her blue ball to Alice.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives up his green ball to Bob.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives up his green ball to Claire.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives up her brown ball to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Eve.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives up her orange ball to Fred.

**The key is to see how the balls are distributed after each swap.**  

* **Bob:**  Bob started with a pink ball and received a green ball from Fred. 
* **Fred:** Fred started with a green ball and received a blue ball from Claire. 
* **Claire:** Claire started with an orange ball and received a blue ball from Fred. 

**Therefore, the answer is (B) pink ball.** 



"
"Bob is now playing **Center Midfielder**.  

Here's why:

* The trades all happened in a specific order, and we know that Bob and Fred traded positions twice. 
*  Bob started as a cheerleader, then became a right winger, then a center midfielder, and finally, a right winger again. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Alice is dancing with Claire. 

The answer is **(F) Sam**. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball trading! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
2. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets Eve's brown ball.
3. **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets Gertrude's blue ball.
4. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
5. **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets Fred's pink ball.
6. **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's orange ball.
7. **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's black ball.

**So, the final ball in Alice's hand is the green ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out what Dave has, we need to know what gifts were swapped.  

Here's how we can think about it:

* **Fred and Eve:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Gertrude and Alice:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Alice and Bob:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Alice and Dave:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Fred and Alice:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Eve and Alice:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.
* **Fred and Claire:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the gifts are now in a different order.

**The problem is that we don't know what gifts were swapped, so we can't determine the final gift Dave has.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who gets which ball after each swap.

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Dave:**  Claire's ball is swapped with Dave's.
2. **Fred and Eve:** Fred's ball is swapped with Eve's.
3. **Bob and Claire:** Bob's ball is swapped with Claire's.
4. **Eve and Alice:** Eve's ball is swapped with Alice's.
5. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve's ball is swapped with Gertrude's.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob's ball is swapped with Dave's.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude's ball is swapped with Bob's.

**The final ball is Gertrude's.  The answer is (G).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has at the end:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Blue
    * Claire: Orange
    * Dave: Yellow
    * Eve: White
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Red

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This changes Eve's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Eve's.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes Bob's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Bob's.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Alice's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Alice's.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This changes Claire's present to Fred's, and Fred's present to Claire's.

**The answer is (E) pink ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!  

Gertrude starts with a brown present.  We know that Dave and Fred swap gifts, and then Gertrude and Dave swap gifts.  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.  Then, Claire and Alice swap gifts.  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.  Bob and Dave swap gifts.  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.  Finally, Alice and Eve swap gifts.  This doesn't change the color of the gifts. 

So, Gertrude will have the brown present at the end. 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob starts as a right winger.  Here's how the positions change:

1. Alice and Gertrude switch positions.
2. Dave and Claire switch positions.
3. Bob and Fred switch positions.
4. Fred and Alice switch positions.
5. Gertrude and Fred switch positions.
6. Dave and Bob switch positions.
7. Claire and Eve switch positions.

So, Bob ends up as the **Fullback**.

"Eve gets the green ball!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Gertrude starts as the benchwarmer, so she'll likely stay there.  Here's how the trades affect the positions:

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Fullback, Fred becomes Goalkeeper
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Fullback
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Benchwarmer
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Goalkeeper
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Right Winger, Bob becomes Center Midfielder

**Final Positions:**

* **Gertrude:** Left Midfielder
* **Alice:** Goalkeeper
* **Bob:** Center Midfielder
* **Claire:** Right Winger
* **Dave:** Fullback
* **Eve:** Center Midfielder
* **Fred:** Right Winger

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred's present is the **black ball**.  

Here's why:

* The swaps only involve pairs of people. 
* Fred's present doesn't change throughout the swaps. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has which book at the end, we need to follow the order of the swaps.  

* **Alice and Bob:**  Alice starts with Moby Dick, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave starts with The Pearl, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Moby Dick, Eve starts with Ulysses.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Catch-22, Dave starts with The Pearl.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Pearl.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.

**The answer is (B) The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Start:** Everyone has a ball.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a brown ball, Gertrude gets a white ball.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets a yellow ball, Claire gets a pink ball.
4. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gets a yellow ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
5. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a pink ball, Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets a pink ball, Claire gets a green ball.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets a green ball, Claire gets a brown ball.
8. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets a brown ball, Claire gets an orange ball.

**So, who has the white ball?**

* (B) white ball

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they both have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve and Alice have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice and Fred have a book they didn't originally get.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at the end of the semester.**

"Fred ends up with Catch-22!  

The answer is (E). 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Alice and Fred swap:** Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
2. **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
3. **Bob and Dave swap:** Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
5. **Claire and Fred swap:** Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
6. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
7. **Alice and Eve swap:** Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

**So, the final ball holder is Bob!**

**Answer: (F) yellow ball.**

Now, let's see who Alice is dancing with at the end. 



**Answer: (F) Karl** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire is dancing with Karl at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Bob is dancing with Lola!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred and Gertrude switch partners first, so Fred is now dancing with Lola.  Then Dave and Claire switch partners, so Dave is now dancing with Sam.  

We need to keep track of who is dancing with whom.  

* Fred: Lola
* Dave: Sam
* Bob: Ophelia
* Claire: Jamie
* Alice: Rodrigo
* Dave: Jamie
* Eve: Karl 


Let me know if you need me to continue!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to figure out what book Gertrude has at the end.  Here's how we can do that:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person starts with a specific book.
* **Track the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are exchanged. 
* **The goal:** We want to know what book Gertrude has at the end.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Lolita, Eve starts with Catch-22.
2. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.
3. **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
4. **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
5. **Alice and Fred:** Alice starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
6. **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with Catch-22, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.

**The key is to understand that the swaps are happening in a circular fashion.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (F) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has what, we need to know what gifts were swapped.  

Here's how we can think about it:

* **We know:**  We know that the gifts were swapped, but we don't know what was swapped. 

* **To figure out who has what:** We need to know what gifts were swapped. 


Let me know if you want to try another scenario! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Gertrude ends up with The Odyssey because of the final swap.  

The answer is **(E) The Odyssey**. 


"
"The answer is **(C) brown ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Bob swap, then Eve and Fred swap, then Dave and Eve swap.  
2. Alice and Bob swap, then Dave and Fred swap.
3. Bob and Claire swap.
4. Gertrude and Alice swap.

The final ball in Alice's possession is the brown ball. 



"
"Dave is now playing center midfielder!  

The correct answer is **(C) center midfielder**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to figure out who has what at the end of the gift exchange.  

Here's how we can do it:

* **Start with the initial colors:** We know Alice has blue, Bob has black, Claire has purple, Dave has pink, Eve has green, Fred has orange, and Gertrude has yellow.

* **We need to see how the swaps affect the colors:**  We need to see how each swap changes the colors. 

* **The key is to keep track of the colors and the people who have them.** 

Let me know if you want to try working through the swaps together!

"Gertrude is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

The answer is (E). 
"
"Dave is the right winger!  

The correct answer is **(G) right winger**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Bob is dancing with Izzi. 

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"The answer is **(D) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap again, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap again, so they both end up with the other's ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.

Gertrude ends up with the ball that was originally Claire's ball.

"Okay, let's break down the ball swap game! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Swap, so they both get a different color ball.

**The answer is (B) green ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** We have a bunch of colors and a bunch of people. 
* **Swapping:**  We're going to swap gifts, which means we're going to change the colors. 
* **The Goal:** We want to figure out what Gertrude has at the end.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Alice and Fred swap.
2. Claire and Bob swap.
3. Dave and Fred swap.
4. Eve and Alice swap.
5. Bob and Alice swap.
6. Eve and Gertrude swap.
7. Fred and Alice swap.

**The answer is (A) white present.**

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Fred is with Sam.
2. **Claire and Fred switch:** Fred is now dancing with someone else.
3. **Claire and Dave switch:** Dave is now Fred's partner.
4. **Alice and Bob switch:** Bob is now Alice's partner.
5. **Claire and Eve switch:** Eve is now Claire's partner.
6. **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave is now Claire's partner.

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change the ownership of either book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

**Dave's book at the end:**

* Dave started with The Odyssey.
* Claire and Dave swapped books, so Dave now has the book Claire had. 

**Therefore, the answer is (G) The Odyssey.**

"Gertrude is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Gertrude is dancing with Jamie at the end! 

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Eve is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Initial Ownership:**
    * Alice: Ulysses
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: The Pearl
    * Eve: Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Fred: Lolita
    * Gertrude: Catch-22

* **Swaps:**
    * Bob and Claire swap:  Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Claire gets The Great Gatsby
    * Dave and Bob swap: Dave gets The Great Gatsby, Bob gets The Pearl
    * Claire and Fred swap: Claire gets Lolita, Fred gets The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Claire and Dave swap: Claire gets The Pearl, Dave gets Lolita
    * Fred and Eve swap: Fred gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Eve gets Lolita
    * Alice and Dave swap: Alice gets The Pearl, Dave gets Ulysses

* **Final Ownership:**  

    * Alice: **(E) Catch-22**
    * Bob: **(B) The Great Gatsby**
    * Claire: **(A) Hound of the Baskervilles**
    * Dave: **(D) The Pearl**
    * Eve: **(F) Ulysses**
    * Fred: **(C) The Fellowship of the Ring**
    * Gertrude: **(G) The Pearl**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know each person got a new book to begin with. 
* **Look for patterns:**  We need to see who traded with whom. 
* **The key is to track the books that Dave traded with others.**

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This changes their books.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This changes their books.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes their books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes their books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes their books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes their books.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This changes their books.

**Dave ends up with Catch-22.**

"The answer is **(C) yellow ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Gertrude swap.
2. Gertrude and Bob swap.
3. Fred and Claire swap.
4. Claire and Dave swap.
5. Claire and Eve swap.
6. Alice and Bob swap.
7. Claire and Eve swap.

Notice that the ball distribution is cyclical.  The final ball is the one that was originally Claire's.

"Eve is dancing with Izzi!  

The answer is **(G)**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Dave and Alice:** Dave starts with a green ball, Alice starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Alice gets the green ball.
2. **Alice and Fred:** Alice now has the pink ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the pink ball and Alice gets the black ball.
3. **Fred and Dave:** Fred now has the pink ball, Dave has the black ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Fred gets the black ball.
4. **Eve and Bob:** Eve now has the blue ball, Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Eve gets the orange ball.
5. **Claire and Fred:** Claire now has the white ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the white ball and Claire gets the black ball.
6. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob now has the orange ball, Gertrude has the yellow ball. They swap, so Gertrude gets the orange ball and Bob gets the yellow ball.
7. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude now has the yellow ball, Alice has the black ball. They swap, so Alice gets the yellow ball and Gertrude gets the black ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the white ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  They swap, so Gertrude starts with Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve and Bob swap, so Eve now has Bob's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap, so Dave now has Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred and Claire swap, so Claire now has Fred's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** Claire and Alice swap, so Alice now has Claire's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap again, so Bob now has Dave's book.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve and Fred swap, so Fred now has Eve's book.

**The key is to remember who has which book at the end.**

**Therefore, the answer is (B) Catch-22.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave ends up with the green present.  

The answer is **(F) green present.** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out Fred's book! 

Here's how we can break it down:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who swaps with whom.

**Let's look at the swaps:**

1. **Alice-Gertrude:** Alice gives up Ulysses, Gertrude gets it.
2. **Dave-Fred:** Dave gives up Moby Dick, Fred gets it.
3. **Alice-Claire:** Alice gives up Ulysses, Claire gets it.
4. **Claire-Bob:** Claire gives up Hound of the Baskervilles, Bob gets it.
5. **Eve-Claire:** Eve gives up Frankenstein, Claire gets it.
6. **Fred-Alice:** Fred gives up The Pearl, Alice gets it.
7. **Claire-Dave:** Claire gives up Moby Dick, Dave gets it.

**Final Book:** Fred ends up with **Moby Dick** (from Dave). 

**Answer:** (D)

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Fred and Alice:**  Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Eve starts with Frankenstein.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Moby Dick, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The key is to keep track of who has which book at each swap.** 

**The answer is (E) The Odyssey.**

"The answer is **(D) green ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Fred and Alice swap: Fred gets Alice's blue ball, Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
2. Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets Gertrude's green ball, Gertrude gets Claire's brown ball.
3. Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's purple ball, Dave gets Bob's red ball.
4. Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Alice's blue ball, Alice gets Eve's black ball.
5. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.
6. Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets Eve's black ball, Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
7. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets Bob's red ball, Bob gets Claire's brown ball.

Fred ends up with the green ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1.  **Start:** Alice-Helga, Bob-Rodrigo, Claire-Sam, Dave-Lola, Eve-Jamie, Fred-Melissa, Gertrude-Karl
2.  **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave-Lola, Eve-Bob
3.  **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Dave-Lola, Gertrude-Bob
4.  **Bob and Fred switch:** Bob-Claire, Fred-Gertrude
5.  **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice-Bob, Eve-Fred
6.  **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob-Gertrude, Claire-Fred

**Final Dance:**  We can see that the final dance partners are:

* **Alice** is dancing with **Bob** 

**Answer:** (B) 



"
"Eve gets the pink ball!  

The answer is **(B)**.

"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Claire starts as a benchwarmer, then Eve and Claire swap positions.  Then, Claire and Dave swap positions.  Dave and Bob swap positions. Fred and Gertrude swap positions. Bob and Claire swap positions again. Dave and Alice swap positions. Finally, Claire and Eve swap positions. 

So, Claire ends up playing **(G) left midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as the striker.  Then, Eve and Fred swap positions.  Then, Claire and Eve swap positions.  Then, Fred and Dave swap positions.  Then, Alice and Claire swap positions.  Then, Gertrude and Dave swap positions.  Finally, Bob and Alice swap positions. 

Alice ends up playing **Goalkeeper**. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave ends up with the black ball because he didn't swap with anyone else. 


The answer is **(E) black ball**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
2. **Eve and Alice switch partners.**
3. **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
5. **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
6. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
7. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**

Now, let's think about who is dancing with whom at the end.  

**The answer is (A) Ophelia.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred starts with Frankenstein, and then he and Dave swap books.  This means Fred now has Dave's book.  

Alice and Claire swap books, so Alice now has Claire's book.

Eve and Dave swap books, so Eve now has Dave's book.

Bob and Eve swap books, so Bob now has Eve's book.

Gertrude and Claire swap books, so Gertrude now has Claire's book.

Eve and Gertrude swap books, so Eve now has Gertrude's book.

Dave and Bob swap books, so Dave now has Bob's book.

**Therefore, Fred's book at the end of the semester is Frankenstein.** 



 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Claire starts as the striker.  Then, Fred and Claire switch positions.  Dave and Gertrude switch positions. Alice and Eve switch positions. Fred and Bob switch positions. Claire and Gertrude switch positions. Fred and Dave switch positions. Finally, Eve and Claire switch positions. 

Claire ends up playing **Center Midfielder**. 


**The answer is (F).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Dave:** Swap books.
* **Fred and Claire:** Swap books.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap books.
* **Bob and Eve:** Swap books.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Swap books.

**The key is to track the books as they are traded.**  

Let's analyze the swaps to see where Alice ends up:

* **Alice's book:** Alice starts with ""The Pearl"".
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob now has ""The Pearl"" and Alice has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has ""The Pearl"" and Bob has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Fred and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Fred has ""The Pearl"".
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Claire now has ""The Pearl"" and Fred has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Dave has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Bob has ""The Pearl"".
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Gertrude has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".

**Therefore, Alice ends up with ""The Great Gatsby"".**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave starts with Patrick.  Then Eve and Dave switch partners.  Fred and Eve switch partners.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Dave and Bob switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Bob and Claire switch partners.  

So, Dave is now dancing with **Bob**. 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Gertrude starts with a pink ball.  She then swaps with Alice, who has a white present.  

The next swap is between Eve and Claire.  Then, Dave and Bob swap.  

We need to keep track of who has what! 

Let me know if you want to continue! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know everyone gets a new book to begin with. 
* **Look for patterns:**  We need to see how the books are swapped around. 
* **Follow the swaps:**  Each swap changes the ownership of a book. 

Let's see what we can figure out! 

**Eve's book:**  Eve ends up with **Hound of the Baskervilles**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Dave is starting with Sam.  We know Fred and Eve switch partners, then Bob and Dave switch partners.  Then Eve and Alice switch partners.  Then Bob and Claire switch partners.  Then Eve and Alice switch partners.  Then Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Dave switch partners. 

So, Dave is now with Sam. 

The answer is (A).

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets a black ball, Bob gets a white present.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets a green present, Fred gets a blue present.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets a purple present, Gertrude gets a white present.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets an orange ball, Eve gets a white present.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball trading works:

1. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her blue ball, Dave gives Eve her red ball.
2. **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gives Eve her yellow ball, Eve gives Gertrude her blue ball.
3. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, Fred gives Bob his black ball.
4. **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his orange ball, Fred gives Claire her black ball.
5. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her green ball, Claire gives Alice her orange ball.
6. **Eve and Fred:** Eve gives Fred his blue ball, Fred gives Eve her black ball.
7. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave his blue ball, Dave gives Eve her red ball.

**Final Ball:** Fred ends up with the **black ball**.

"Bob is playing Center Midfielder!  

Here's why:

Let's look at the trades and how they affect Bob's position:

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Striker, Alice becomes Left Winger
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes Cheerleader, Bob becomes Striker
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes Striker, Alice becomes Center Midfielder
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes Benchwarmer, Dave becomes Right Winger
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes Right Winger, Eve becomes Center Midfielder
* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes Right Winger, Bob becomes Center Midfielder 


 
 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has the book Alice had at the start:

* **Initial Ownership:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Claire: The Great Gatsby
    * Dave: Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Eve: Frankenstein
    * Fred: Moby Dick
    * Gertrude: Ulysses

* **Swaps:**
    * Eve and Fred swap:  Eve gets Fred's book, Fred gets Eve's book.
    * Claire and Bob swap:  Claire gets Bob's book, Bob gets Claire's book.
    * Fred and Eve swap:  Fred gets Eve's book, Eve gets Fred's book.
    * Gertrude and Alice swap:  Gertrude gets Alice's book, Alice gets Gertrude's book.
    * Fred and Dave swap:  Fred gets Dave's book, Dave gets Fred's book.
    * Gertrude and Eve swap:  Gertrude gets Eve's book, Eve gets Gertrude's book.
    * Dave and Fred swap:  Dave gets Fred's book, Fred gets Dave's book.

* **Final Ownership:**  We need to figure out who has the book Alice had at the start. 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.**

"Fred is the right winger!  

The correct answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as a left midfielder.  Here's what happens:

1. Fred and Gertrude switch positions. Fred becomes a left winger, and Gertrude becomes a fullback.
2. Dave and Gertrude switch positions. Dave becomes a fullback, and Gertrude becomes a right winger.
3. Gertrude and Fred switch positions again. Gertrude becomes a left winger, and Fred becomes a fullback.
4. Alice and Bob switch positions. Alice becomes a cheerleader, and Bob becomes a left winger.
5. Claire and Dave switch positions. Claire becomes a right winger, and Dave becomes a left winger.
6. Eve and Claire switch positions. Eve becomes a right winger, and Claire becomes a left winger.
7. Alice and Gertrude switch positions. Alice becomes a fullback, and Gertrude becomes a left winger.

So, Alice is now playing fullback! 


**Answer: (B) fullback** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start with the initial ownership:**  We know each person got a new book at the beginning of the semester. 
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see which books were swapped and who got which books. 
* **The final swap:**  The final swap is the key to figuring out who has which book.

"Bob ends up with the white present!  

The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Alice has:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Purple
    * Bob: Brown
    * Claire: Red
    * Dave: Green
    * Eve: Black
    * Fred: Yellow
    * Gertrude: White

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This changes Eve's present to something Dave had.
* **Fred and Dave swap:** This changes Dave's present to something Fred had.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's present to something Claire had.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to something Dave had.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** This changes Fred's present to something Bob had.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present to something Fred had.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes Bob's present to something Alice had.

**The final answer is (E) brown present.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

We need to figure out who has what present after all the swaps.  

Here's how we can do it:

* **Start with the initial colors:**  We know Alice has purple, Bob has brown, Claire has red, Dave has green, Eve has black, Fred has yellow, and Gertrude has white.

* **Think about the swaps:**  We need to consider what happens when people swap gifts.  

* **The key is to think about the order of the swaps:**  The order of the swaps matters because it determines who ends up with which color. 

Let me know if you want to try another scenario!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Dave and Claire switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Claire and Fred switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Fred and Alice switch partners:** This changes their partners.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** This changes their partners.

**The final dance partners are:**

* **Gertrude is dancing with Dave.**
* **Alice is dancing with Fred.**
* **Bob is dancing with Eve.**
* **Claire is dancing with Izzi.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Alice starts with a blue present.  Here's how the swaps go:

* Fred and Gertrude swap: Fred gets Purple, Gertrude gets Yellow.
* Fred and Eve swap: Fred gets Black, Eve gets Yellow.
* Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets Orange, Claire gets Brown.
* Claire and Gertrude swap: Claire gets Purple, Gertrude gets Orange.
* Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets Black, Eve gets Brown.
* Alice and Fred swap: Alice gets Yellow, Fred gets Blue.
* Alice and Bob swap: Alice gets Red, Bob gets Blue.

So, Alice ends up with the blue present! 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire and Dave swap, so Claire gets Dave's purple ball and Dave gets Claire's brown ball.  Then Fred and Eve swap, so Fred gets Eve's white ball and Eve gets Fred's red ball.  

Bob and Claire swap, so Bob gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Bob's brown ball.  Then Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's white ball.  Then Eve and Gertrude swap, so Eve gets Gertrude's pink ball and Gertrude gets Eve's white ball.  Finally, Bob and Dave swap, so Bob gets Dave's blue ball and Dave gets Bob's purple ball. 

So, the final ball distribution is:

* **Claire:**  The only ball she didn't swap is her brown ball. 


**Answer:** (G) brown ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. Eve and Claire switch partners.
2. Fred and Gertrude switch partners.
3. Eve and Bob switch partners.
4. Eve and Alice switch partners.
5. Dave and Bob switch partners.
6. Dave and Eve switch partners.
7. Alice and Dave switch partners.

So, at the end, Alice is dancing with Dave. 

The answer is **(A) Rodrigo.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred is with Rodrigo at the end.  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Gertrude has:

* **Start:**  We know Gertrude has a purple present.
* **Claire and Bob Swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Fred and Bob Swap:** Fred's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Fred's.
* **Dave and Claire Swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Claire Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Alice and Dave Swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Eve Swap:** This changes the colors.

**The answer is (E) purple present.** 



"
"Claire is dancing with Jamie!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has what, we need to think about how each swap affects the gifts.  

Here's a breakdown:

* **Initial State:**
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Yellow
    * Claire: White
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Purple
    * Fred: Red
    * Gertrude: Orange

* **We need to figure out the final state of the gifts after all the swaps.** 

Let me know if you'd like to try a different scenario! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Each person gets a book.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her book, and Eve gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Bob's book.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Dave's book.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Gertrude gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Gertrude's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

**The answer is (F) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire starts with Patrick.  Then, Fred and Alice switch partners.  Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Claire and Eve switch partners.  Fred and Dave switch partners.  Claire and Alice switch partners.  Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. 

So, Claire is now dancing with Bob. 

The answer is **(B) Patrick.** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change the ownership of either book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

**The key is to remember that the swaps are happening in a specific order.**

**Final State:**

* **Bob** ends up with **The Pearl** because he swapped with Fred and then with Gertrude.


**Therefore, the answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has the brown present at the end, we need to see how the gifts are swapped.  

Here's what we know:

* **Initial State:** Alice: White, Bob: Orange, Claire: Black, Dave: Pink, Eve: Purple, Fred: Green, Gertrude: Brown

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This changes their gifts, but we don't know what they got.

**The key is to understand that the gifts are being swapped, not necessarily changing colors or types.** 

**The problem is missing information.** 

Let me know if you want to explore a different scenario with more information!

"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Alice and Fred swap:** Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
2. **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
3. **Bob and Dave swap:** Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
5. **Claire and Fred swap:** Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
6. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
7. **Alice and Eve swap:** Eve gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Eve's ball.

**Fred ends up with the green ball.** 


So the answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Bob is dancing with Ophelia!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the final book Bob has:

* **Start:**  We know everyone gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track the swaps to see who ends up with what. 

Let's break down the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This changes the ownership of The Pearl and Frankenstein.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** This changes the ownership of The Odyssey and Frankenstein.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This changes the ownership of The Odyssey and The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This changes the ownership of Hound of the Baskervilles and Lolita.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes the ownership of Ulysses and The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes the ownership of Hound of the Baskervilles and Frankenstein.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This changes the ownership of Lolita and Hound of the Baskervilles.

**Final Answer:** Bob ends up with **Hound of the Baskervilles**.

"The answer is **(E) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This changes Alice's present.

"Fred ends up with The Great Gatsby!  

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. **Fred starts with Frankenstein.**
2. **Fred and Dave swap:**  Dave now has Frankenstein.
3. **Eve and Fred swap:**  Eve now has Frankenstein.
4. **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  Bob now has Frankenstein.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:**  Bob now has Ulysses.
6. **Eve and Bob swap:**  Bob now has The Great Gatsby.
7. **Dave and Alice swap:**  Alice now has The Great Gatsby.
8. **Fred and Claire swap:**  Claire now has The Great Gatsby.

Fred's book is The Great Gatsby.

"The answer is **(A) Lolita**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Eve and Bob swap books.
2. Fred and Gertrude swap books.
3. Claire and Fred swap books.
4. Dave and Eve swap books.
5. Gertrude and Claire swap books.
6. Alice and Gertrude swap books.
7. Claire and Bob swap books.

Following these trades, Bob ends up with Lolita. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Fred his ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Fred his ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve her ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Alice her ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Claire his ball.

**The final ball distribution is:**

* **Gertrude:**  The ball she has is the one she started with. 
* **Alice:** The ball she has is the one she started with. 
* **Bob:** The ball he has is the one he started with. 
* **Claire:** The ball she has is the one she started with.

"Eve ends up with Dave's book, which is Ulysses. 

The answer is **(A) Ulysses**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

To figure out who has which book at the end, we need to follow the order of the swaps.  

Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initial Books:** Each person starts with a new book.
2. **Gertrude and Fred Swap:** This means they both started with different books.
3. **Alice and Claire Swap:** This means they both started with different books.
4. **Bob and Dave Swap:** This means they both started with different books.
5. **Claire and Dave Swap:** This means they both started with different books.
6. **Bob and Eve Swap:** This means they both started with different books.
7. **Claire and Dave Swap:** This means they both started with different books.
8. **Eve and Alice Swap:** This means they both started with different books.

**Therefore, we can conclude that Gertrude has the book she started with.**

* Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets pink, Dave gets orange.
* Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets white, Alice gets pink.
* Bob and Claire swap: Bob gets black, Claire gets orange.
* Fred and Eve swap: Fred gets green, Eve gets purple.
* Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets brown, Claire gets black.
* Fred and Gertrude swap: Fred gets brown, Gertrude gets green.

The only gift that remains unchanged is Alice's. 

**Answer:** (F) orange ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **Initial Books:**
    * Alice: The Odyssey
    * Bob: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Claire: Moby Dick
    * Dave: The Pearl
    * Eve: The Great Gatsby
    * Fred: Catch-22
    * Gertrude: Hound of the Baskervilles

* **Swaps:**
    * Gertrude and Dave swap:  Gertrude gets Dave's book, Dave gets Gertrude's book.
    * Eve and Claire swap: Eve gets Claire's book, Claire gets Eve's book.
    * Dave and Gertrude swap: Dave gets Gertrude's book, Gertrude gets Dave's book.
    * Gertrude and Eve swap: Gertrude gets Eve's book, Eve gets Gertrude's book.
    * Alice and Eve swap: Alice gets Eve's book, Eve gets Alice's book.
    * Bob and Dave swap: Bob gets Dave's book, Dave gets Bob's book.
    * Alice and Fred swap: Alice gets Fred's book, Fred gets Alice's book.

* **Final Book:**  To figure out who has which book, we need to track the books that were swapped.  

Let me know if you'd like to continue working through the swaps!

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has what after all the swaps:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Pink
    * Bob: Brown
    * Claire: Red
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: White
    * Fred: Orange
    * Gertrude: Black

* **Alice and Dave Swap:**  Alice's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Dave Swap:**  Claire's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Gertrude Swap:** Fred's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Fred's.
* **Eve and Gertrude Swap:** Eve's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Eve's.
* **Eve and Alice Swap:** Eve's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob Swap:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Dave Swap:** Gertrude's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Gertrude's.

**The answer is (E) black ball.**

"Gertrude ends up playing fullback!  

The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Start:** Alice is Center Midfielder, Bob is Striker, Claire is Left Winger, Dave is Cheerleader, Eve is Fullback, Fred is Right Winger, and Gertrude is Benchwarmer.

2. **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice becomes Left Winger, Claire becomes Center Midfielder.

3. **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude becomes Striker, Bob becomes Fullback.

4. **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Alice becomes Fullback.

5. **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire becomes Right Winger, Fred becomes Center Midfielder.

6. **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes Cheerleader, Dave becomes Fullback.

7. **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes Right Winger, Fred becomes Center Midfielder.

8. **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes Striker, Bob becomes Right Winger.

**Final Positions:**

* Alice: Fullback
* Bob: Striker
* Claire: Right Winger
* Dave: Cheerleader
* Eve: Center Midfielder
* Fred: Striker
* Gertrude: Benchwarmer


**Answer:** (F) right winger

"Eve gets the blue ball!  

The answer is **(C)**.

"Fred is playing left winger!  

The answer is (G).

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end of the semester:

* **We know they all start with a new book.**  
* **The swaps are happening in a circular fashion.**  

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Fred and Dave swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
2. **Eve and Fred swap:**  This means Eve had a book Fred traded.
3. **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
5. **Eve and Bob swap:**  This means Eve had a book Bob traded.
6. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.
7. **Fred and Claire swap:**  This means they both had a book they traded.

**The swaps are happening in a circular fashion, so we can deduce that the final book ownership is:**

* **Gertrude:**  Ulysses
* **Bob:**  The Great Gatsby
* **Dave:**  The Odyssey
* **Alice:**  Moby Dick
* **Eve:**  The Pearl
* **Fred:**  Frankenstein
* **Claire:**  Hound of the Baskervilles

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the blue present:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Green
    * Bob: Blue
    * Claire: Red
    * Dave: Purple
    * Eve: Brown
    * Fred: White
    * Gertrude: Yellow

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Eve's present.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means Bob now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Bob's present.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means Fred now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Fred's present.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has Bob's present, and Bob now has Dave's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has Alice's present, and Alice now has Bob's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire now has Dave's present, and Dave now has Claire's present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice now has Claire's present, and Claire now has Alice's present.

**The answer is (D) blue present.** 



 
"
"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the book that was originally owned by Gertrude:

* **Start with the initial distribution:**  We know everyone starts with a new book.
* **Look at the swaps:**  We need to see how the books are exchanged. 
* **Identify the key swaps:**  The swaps are important because they change the ownership of the books. 
* **The final swap:**  The final swap is the key to figuring out who has the book that was originally owned by Gertrude. 

Let me know if you'd like me to explain the swaps in more detail! 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Fred is the left winger at the end of the match. 

Here's why:

* **The trades:** We need to follow the order of the trades to see where Fred ends up. 
* **Fred's position:** Fred starts as a left winger and then moves to the left midfielder, then to the center midfielder, then to the left winger.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

1. **Start with the initial colors:**  We know Alice has blue, Bob has yellow, Claire has red, Dave has black, Eve has white, Fred has brown, and Gertrude has orange.

2. **Swap 1:** Alice and Fred swap.  This means Fred now has Alice's present, and Alice now has Fred's.

3. **Swap 2:** Claire and Bob swap.  This means Bob now has Claire's present, and Claire now has Bob's.

4. **Swap 3:** Dave and Fred swap.  This means Fred now has Dave's present, and Dave now has Fred's.

5. **Swap 4:** Eve and Alice swap.  This means Alice now has Eve's present, and Eve now has Alice's.

6. **Swap 5:** Bob and Alice swap.  This means Alice now has Bob's present, and Bob now has Alice's.

7. **Swap 6:** Eve and Gertrude swap.  This means Gertrude now has Eve's present, and Eve now has Gertrude's.

8. **Swap 7:** Fred and Alice swap.  This means Alice now has Fred's present, and Fred now has Alice's.

**The final gift Fred has is the one that was originally Fred's.** 



**Answer:** (D) brown present. 



"
"The answer is **(B) The Pearl**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see how they affect Dave's book:

* **Initial:** Dave starts with *The Pearl*.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end. 

The swaps don't change Dave's book. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Fred and Eve:** Swap, so Eve gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Eve's ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Swap, so Bob gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Bob's ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Swap, so Bob gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Bob's ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Swap, so Alice gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Alice's ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Swap, so Gertrude gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Gertrude's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Swap, so Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Swap, so Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.

**The answer is (E) green ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to see who ends up with the ball after all the trades.  

* **Dave** is the only one who has a ball that hasn't been traded. 

**Therefore, the answer is (A) brown ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start:** Each person gets a new book.
* **Swaps:** The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to track who has which book at the end.

Let's analyze the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave started with a different book than Gertrude.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave started with a different book than Claire.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob started with different books.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire started with different books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This means Alice and Gertrude started with different books.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob and Alice started with different books.

**The key is to keep track of who started with which book.** 

**Here's a possible solution:**

1. **Gertrude:** Frankenstein
2. **Fred:** The Pearl
3. **Dave:** The Odyssey
4. **Claire:** The Great Gatsby
5. **Alice:** Hound of the Baskervilles
6. **Bob:** Lolita
7. **Eve:** Ulysses 


Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 



"
"Claire is playing Center Midfielder!  

Here's why:

* **The trades:**  We need to look at the positions that were swapped and how they changed. 
* **The key:**  The positions that were swapped are the ones that matter. 
* **The answer:**  The final position is Center Midfielder. 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are swapping partners throughout the song.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Dave and Bob switch partners:** Dave now dances with Ophelia.
* **Eve and Claire switch partners:** Eve and Claire now dance with each other.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch partners:** Claire and Gertrude now dance with each other.
* **Alice and Eve switch partners:** Alice and Eve now dance with each other.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** Gertrude and Alice now dance with each other.
* **Eve and Fred switch partners:** Eve and Fred now dance with each other.
* **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:** Gertrude and Claire now dance with each other.

**Therefore, Dave is dancing with Ophelia.** 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball swapping! 

Here's how the game goes:

1. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gives Eve her orange ball.
2. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice his yellow ball, and Alice gives Dave his brown ball.
3. **Fred and Dave:** Fred gives Dave his white ball, and Dave gives Fred his yellow ball.
4. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his black ball, and Fred gives Bob his white ball.
5. **Claire and Dave:** Claire gives Dave his red ball, and Dave gives Claire his yellow ball.
6. **Bob and Dave:** Bob gives Dave his black ball, and Dave gives Bob his yellow ball.

**The final ball distribution:**

* Eve: **Pink ball**
* Bob: **Black ball**
* Claire: **Red ball**
* Dave: **Yellow ball**
* Fred: **White ball**
* Gertrude: **Orange ball**
* Alice: **Brown ball**


**So the answer is (E) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1. **Start:** Alice-Jamie, Bob-Ophelia, Claire-Patrick, Dave-Karl, Eve-Lola, Fred-Melissa, Gertrude-Helga
2. **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob-Karl, Dave-Ophelia
3. **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude-Melissa, Fred-Alice
4. **Fred and Bob switch:** Fred-Alice, Bob-Gertrude
5. **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve-Gertrude, Bob-Melissa
6. **Gertrude and Alice switch:** Gertrude-Patrick, Alice-Bob
7. **Fred and Claire switch:** Fred-Eve, Claire-Melissa

**The final dance partner for Alice is Bob.** 

The answer is **(C) Ophelia**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve ends up with Dave's book because of the final swap.  

The answer is **(B) Catch-22**. 



"
"Eve is the striker!  

The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Alice starts as a left midfielder.  She then trades with Dave, becoming a left winger.  Then, she trades with Claire, becoming a benchwarmer.  Then, she trades with Dave again, becoming a left midfielder.  Claire then trades with Fred, becoming a left winger.  Dave then trades with Eve, becoming a cheerleader.  Finally, Gertrude and Bob trade positions.  

So, Alice is now playing left winger. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"The answer is **(G) pink ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

* Eve and Dave swap, then Eve and Fred swap, then Eve and Dave swap again. This means Eve ends up with the red ball.
* Alice and Bob swap, and then Alice and Dave swap. This means Alice ends up with the red ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, and then Alice and Dave swap. This means Claire ends up with the pink ball.

"The answer is **(C) purple ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Eve swap.
2. Dave and Fred swap.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap.
4. Fred and Claire swap.
5. Bob and Fred swap.
6. Gertrude and Bob swap.
7. Gertrude and Claire swap.

Notice that Alice is the only one who ends up with the purple ball. 



"
"Eve is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(G) Jamie**. 
"
"The answer is **(A) blue present**. 

Here's why:

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Dave and Fred swap: Dave gets yellow, Fred gets orange.
2. Bob and Fred swap: Bob gets yellow, Fred gets orange.
3. Gertrude and Dave swap: Gertrude gets orange, Dave gets blue.
4. Dave and Claire swap: Dave gets pink, Claire gets orange.
5. Dave and Eve swap: Dave gets purple, Eve gets orange.
6. Claire and Bob swap: Claire gets black, Bob gets purple.
7. Dave and Alice swap: Dave gets white, Alice gets black.

Dave ends up with the blue present. 



"
"Claire is dancing with Rodrigo!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Gertrude ends up with the pink ball because of the following swaps:

1. **Bob and Eve swap:**  This changes Bob's present to red and Eve's present to white.
2. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This changes Claire's present to orange and Gertrude's present to pink.
3. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to black and Dave's present to orange.
4. **Eve and Fred swap:** This changes Eve's present to brown and Fred's present to red.
5. **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to white and Bob's present to brown.
6. **Claire and Alice swap:** This changes Claire's present to yellow and Alice's present to pink.
7. **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to orange and Bob's present to white.

So, the final answer is **(B) pink ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  Dave gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred gets a new ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Bob gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice gets a new ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice gets a new ball.

**The final answer is (D) blue ball.**

"Okay, let's break down the book swaps! 

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Alice and Bob:**  Alice starts with Catch-22, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire starts with The Great Gatsby, Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob starts with Moby Dick.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave starts with The Odyssey.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Gertrude starts with Lolita.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with The Odyssey, Claire starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with Frankenstein, Eve starts with Lolita.

**Final Swap:** Fred and Eve swap books, so Eve ends up with Frankenstein.

**Therefore, the answer is (E) Frankenstein.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can figure out what Bob has:

* **Start:**
    * Bob: Yellow
    * Alice: Red
    * Claire: Black
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Purple
    * Fred: White
    * Gertrude: Brown

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This changes Gertrude's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This changes Claire's present to Dave's, and Dave's present to Claire's.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes Eve's present to Claire's, and Claire's present to Eve's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This changes Dave's present to Alice's, and Alice's present to Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This changes Alice's present to Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present to Alice's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This changes Gertrude's present to Eve's, and Eve's present to Gertrude's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This changes Fred's present to Bob's, and Bob's present to Fred's.

**The final gift exchange leaves Bob with the purple present.**

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Bob ends up with *The Fellowship of the Ring*. 

The correct answer is **(C)**. 
"
"The answer is **(B) red ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Dave:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
2. **Eve and Alice:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
3. **Gertrude and Eve:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
4. **Claire and Alice:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
5. **Dave and Eve:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
6. **Alice and Gertrude:** Swap, so they both end up with the other's ball.
7. **Fred and Bob:** Swap, so Fred ends up with Bob's ball. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the answer:

* **Initial Ownership:**
    * Alice: Lolita
    * Bob: The Great Gatsby
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: Catch-22
    * Eve: The Odyssey
    * Fred: Moby Dick
    * Gertrude: Ulysses

* **Swaps:**
    * Eve and Gertrude swap:  Eve gets Ulysses, Gertrude gets The Odyssey
    * Bob and Eve swap: Bob gets The Odyssey, Eve gets The Great Gatsby
    * Alice and Gertrude swap: Alice gets The Odyssey, Gertrude gets Ulysses
    * Claire and Eve swap: Claire gets The Odyssey, Eve gets Catch-22
    * Eve and Alice swap: Eve gets Catch-22, Alice gets The Odyssey
    * Fred and Alice swap: Fred gets The Odyssey, Alice gets Catch-22
    * Eve and Dave swap: Eve gets Catch-22, Dave gets The Odyssey

* **Final Ownership:**  

    * Alice has **The Great Gatsby**.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Alice: Blue, Bob: Green, Claire: Brown, Dave: Purple, Eve: Orange, Fred: Pink, Gertrude: Red

We need to figure out what happens to each person's present after the swaps.  

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Eve's. 
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Fred's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Gertrude's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Claire's.

**The answer is (E) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Gertrude starts with the orange ball.  Here's how the swaps go:

* **Bob and Alice:**  Bob's green gift goes to Alice, and Alice's green gift goes to Bob.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire's purple gift goes to Dave, and Dave's red gift goes to Claire.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob's white gift goes to Gertrude, and Gertrude's orange ball goes to Bob.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred's yellow gift goes to Bob, and Bob's white gift goes to Fred.
* **Claire and Eve:** Claire's purple gift goes to Eve, and Eve's blue gift goes to Claire.

"The answer is **(B) black ball**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice and Eve swap.
2. Dave and Fred swap.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap.
4. Fred and Claire swap.
5. Bob and Fred swap.
6. Gertrude and Bob swap.
7. Gertrude and Claire swap.

Notice that the ball swapping always results in a new player holding the ball that was previously held by another player.  This means that the final player holding the ball is the one who received the ball that was previously held by the player who swapped with them. 



"
"Okay, let's break down the game! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Start:** Everyone has a unique color ball.
* **Swaps:**  The swaps happen in a specific order, and we need to see how the colors are distributed at the end.

**Let's analyze the swaps:**

* **Claire and Bob:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Claire and Dave:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Fred and Gertrude:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Fred:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Alice and Dave:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This swap doesn't change the color of the balls.

**Conclusion:**

The swaps don't change the color of the balls. 

**Answer:**  None of the above. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the ball swapping works:

1. **Eve and Claire:** Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Claire now has the purple ball.
2. **Bob and Eve:** Bob starts with a black ball, and Eve now has a purple ball. They swap, so Bob now has the purple ball.
3. **Claire and Alice:** Claire now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Alice now has the purple ball.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Bob now has the pink ball.
5. **Dave and Eve:** Dave now has the purple ball, and Eve has the purple ball. They swap, so Dave now has the purple ball.
6. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred now has the purple ball, and Gertrude has the brown ball. They swap, so Fred now has the brown ball.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude now has the brown ball, and Claire has the pink ball. They swap, so Gertrude now has the pink ball.

**Therefore, Claire has the pink ball at the end of the game.** 

**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

Dave starts as a cheerleader, and we know that he and Bob switch positions.  Then, Eve and Claire switch positions.  Then, Gertrude and Alice switch positions.  Then, Dave and Bob switch positions again.  Then, Claire and Alice switch positions again.  Finally, Bob and Alice switch positions again. 

So, Dave is now playing right winger! 


**Answer:** (B)

"Let me know if you'd like to try another book swap puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's break down the ball trades! 

Here's how the game goes:

* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gives Fred her green ball, and Fred gets Alice's green ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gives Eve her orange ball, and Eve gets Claire's orange ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gives Gertrude her purple ball, and Gertrude gets Dave's purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gives Dave his brown ball, and Dave gets Eve's brown ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gets Fred's pink ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob her orange ball, and Bob gets Claire's orange ball.

**The final ball distribution is:**

* **Dave:** Has the purple ball. 


**Answer:** (E) 
"
"The answer is **(D) Catch-22**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps and see how the books end up:

1. **Initial:** Alice has *The Great Gatsby*, Bob has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, etc.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*.
3. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets *The Great Gatsby*, Alice gets *Frankenstein*.
4. **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets *Ulysses*, Gertrude gets *Catch-22*.
5. **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets *The Pearl*, Fred gets *Lolita*.
6. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets *Catch-22*, Claire gets *Ulysses*.
7. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets *Ulysses*, Claire gets *Catch-22*.
8. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude gets *Catch-22*, Dave gets *Lolita*.

Dave ends up with *Lolita*.

"Eve is dancing with Helga!  

The answer is **(F)**. 
"
"Let's break down the swaps! 

Here's how the books are traded:

1. **Initial Purchases:** Each person gets a new book.
2. **Dave and Gertrude:** Swap books.
3. **Claire and Bob:** Swap books.
4. **Alice and Dave:** Swap books.
5. **Fred and Claire:** Swap books.
6. **Dave and Fred:** Swap books.
7. **Bob and Claire:** Swap books.
8. **Eve and Fred:** Swap books.

**The final swap is Eve and Fred.** 

**Therefore, the answer is (E) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  Gertrude gives Bob her ball, and Bob gives Gertrude his ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Dave his ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Gertrude his ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Bob his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.

**The answer is (G) red ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the dance partners change:

1.  Dave starts with Helga.
2.  Fred and Eve switch partners.
3.  Bob and Eve switch partners.
4.  Fred and Dave switch partners.
5.  Bob and Fred switch partners.
6.  Bob and Gertrude switch partners.
7.  Fred and Dave switch partners.
8.  Claire and Alice switch partners.

The final dance is with Dave and someone new. 

**The answer is (A) Ophelia.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Fred swapped balls, then Dave and Claire swapped, and so on.  Let's see who ends up with what ball. 

* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with pink, Eve starts with orange. They swap, so Fred now has orange and Eve has pink.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with black, Claire starts with red. They swap, so Claire now has black and Dave has red.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice starts with white, Gertrude starts with purple. They swap, so Gertrude now has white and Alice has purple.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude now has white, Eve has pink. They swap, so Eve now has white and Gertrude has pink.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve now has white, Fred has orange. They swap, so Fred now has white and Eve has orange.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred now has white, Alice has orange. They swap, so Alice now has white and Fred has orange.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice now has white, Bob has yellow. They swap, so Bob now has white and Alice has yellow.

**Therefore, Bob has the yellow ball at the end.** 

**Answer:** (D) 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Claire starts with a pink ball.  Since everyone is swapping gifts, we need to see how the colors change hands. 

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Alice and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.

**Answer:** (G) pink ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out the answer:

* **Initial Ownership:**  We know each person starts with a new book.
* **Swaps:**  We need to track the swaps to see how the books end up. 

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Eve's.
2. **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Fred's.
3. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
4. **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice's book is now Fred's, and Fred's book is now Alice's.
5. **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's book is now Dave's, and Dave's book is now Claire's.
6. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
7. **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve's book is now Bob's, and Bob's book is now Eve's.

**Analyzing the swaps:**

* **Alice:** Alice's book is always the one that is swapped with Fred. 
* **Fred:** Fred's book is always the one that is swapped with Alice. 
* **Claire:** Claire's book is always the one that is swapped with Dave and Fred. 
* **Bob:** Bob's book is always the one that is swapped with Gertrude. 
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude's book is always the one that is swapped with Bob. 
* **Eve:** Eve's book is always the one that is swapped with Bob. 
* **Dave:** Dave's book is always the one that is swapped with Claire. 


**Conclusion:**

The only way to get to the end of the semester with Alice having The Odyssey is if she and Fred swapped books.

"The answer is **(C) yellow present**. 

Here's why:

* Claire starts with a pink ball.
* Alice starts with a yellow present.
* Bob starts with a red present.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Bob's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Claire's present, and Bob gets Alice's present.

Since Claire started with a pink ball, and Alice started with a yellow present, the only possible outcome is that Claire ends up with the yellow present.

"Okay, let's break down the book swapping! 

Here's how the books end up:

* **Alice starts with:** Lolita
* **Bob starts with:** Hound of the Baskervilles
* **Claire starts with:** The Fellowship of the Ring

We know they swap books in a specific order.  Let's see how it goes:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they both get each other's books. 
    * Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles

2. **Alice and Bob swap:**  
    * Alice gets Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Bob gets The Fellowship of the Ring

3. **Final Result:**
    * Alice: **Hound of the Baskervilles**
    * Bob: **The Fellowship of the Ring**
    * Claire: **Lolita** 


So the answer is **(C) Hound of the Baskervilles**.

"The answer is **(A) Patrick**. 

Here's why:

* Alice and Bob switch partners first, so Alice is now with Claire and Bob is with Lola.
* Then, Claire and Bob switch partners, so Claire is now with Alice and Bob is with Patrick.
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire and Alice is with Rodrigo.

"Okay, let's break it down! 

Here's how the gift exchange works:

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they exchange their presents.  We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means they exchange their presents again.

The key is that the order of the swaps matters.  

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Alice starts with yellow**
* **Bob starts with blue**
* **Claire starts with green**

**Scenario 1: Alice and Bob swap first**

* Alice gets Bob's present (blue)
* Bob gets Alice's present (yellow)

**Scenario 2: Claire and Alice swap first**

* Claire gets Alice's present (yellow)
* Alice gets Claire's present (green)

**Scenario 3: Alice and Bob swap second**

* Alice gets Bob's present (blue)
* Bob gets Alice's present (yellow)

**Conclusion:**

The only way Alice ends up with the green present is if Claire and Alice swap first. 


**Therefore, the answer is (A) green present.** 



"
"Bob is playing center midfielder!  

Here's why:

* **The trades happen in a specific order:**  We know that Claire and Alice switch positions first, then Alice and Bob, and finally Claire and Bob. 
* **Bob's position changes:**  Since Bob starts as the goalkeeper, he must have moved to center midfielder after Alice and then Claire.

"The answer is **(B) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the book swaps:

1. **Initial:** Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *Catch-22*, and Claire has *Ulysses*.
2. **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets *Ulysses* and Claire gets *Catch-22*.
3. **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire gets *Catch-22* and Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*. 

Therefore, at the end of the semester, Claire has *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Alice starts with a red present, Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a pink ball.  

Here's how the swapping works:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice starts with a red present, and Claire starts with a pink ball, they swap.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Claire's pink ball, and Bob has Alice's red present, they swap.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:**  They exchange their gifts. Since Alice now has Bob's red present, and Claire has Bob's black ball, they swap.

**So, Claire ends up with the black ball!**

"The answer is **(A) Melissa**. 

Here's why:

* Bob and Alice switch partners first, so Bob is now with Melissa.
* Then, Claire and Alice switch partners, so Bob is now with Alice. 
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners again, leaving Bob with Melissa. 



"
"The answer is **(C) The Odyssey**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the trades:

1. Alice starts with Frankenstein.
2. Alice and Claire swap, so Alice gets Lolita and Claire gets Frankenstein.
3. Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Frankenstein and Alice gets The Odyssey.
4. Claire and Bob swap, so Claire gets The Odyssey and Bob gets Lolita. 

This means Alice ends up with The Odyssey. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how the gift exchange works:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Alice's, and Alice's present becomes Claire's. 
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Alice's.

The key is that the gifts are swapped, not necessarily the colors.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Bob starts with the purple present.**
* **Alice starts with the orange ball.**
* **Claire starts with the blue present.**

After the swaps, Bob will have the blue present. 

**Therefore, the answer is (C).** 



"
"The answer is **(C) Rodrigo**. 

Here's why:

* Bob and Claire switch partners, then Alice and Bob switch partners. 
* This means that Bob and Claire switch partners again. 
* Since they started with Claire dancing with Rodrigo, the final dance will be Claire with Rodrigo. 



"
"The answer is **(C) Izzi**. 

Here's why:

* Claire and Alice switch partners first, so Claire is now with Bob.
* Then Bob and Claire switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire.
* Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Claire.

"Bob ends up with the orange ball!  

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"The final dance partner for Alice is Ophelia! 

The correct answer is **(A) Ophelia**. 
"
"The answer is **(B)**.  

Here's why:

* **Step 1:** Alice starts with a white present.
* **Step 2:** Bob and Alice swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Bob gets the white present.
* **Step 3:** Claire and Bob swap, so Bob gets the brown present and Claire gets the orange ball.
* **Step 4:** Claire and Alice swap, so Alice gets the brown present and Claire gets the white present. 



Let me know if you have any other fun logic puzzles! 
"
"Okay, let's break it down! 

Here's how the gift exchange works:

1. **Start:** Alice has an orange ball, Bob has a purple present, and Claire has a red present.
2. **Claire & Bob swap:**  Claire gets Bob's purple present and Bob gets Claire's red present.
3. **Alice & Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's purple present and Bob gets Alice's orange present.

So, Bob ends up with the orange ball! 


**Answer: (C) orange ball.**

"The final position Alice ends up in is right midfielder! 

The correct answer is **(C).** 
"
"Bob is playing striker!  

Here's why:

* **Claire and Alice trade positions:**  Claire moves to the goalkeeper position, and Alice moves to the striker position.
* **Alice and Bob trade positions:** Alice moves to the left midfielder position, and Bob moves to the goalkeeper position.
* **Bob and Claire trade positions:** Bob moves to the striker position, and Claire moves to the goalkeeper position.

"Okay, so let's break it down! 

Alice starts with a red present, Bob has a black ball, and Claire has a pink ball.  

Here's what happens:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets the pink ball and Claire gets the red present.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice gets the pink ball and Bob gets the red present.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets the red present and Claire gets the pink ball.

So, Bob ends up with the pink ball! 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

* **Start:** Alice is fullback, Bob is goalkeeper, and Claire is left midfielder.
* **First Trade:** Claire and Alice switch positions.  Claire becomes fullback, and Alice becomes left midfielder.

"The final position Claire is playing is striker! 

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"The answer is **(B)**.  

Here's why:

Let's break down the swaps:

1. **Claire and Alice:**  Claire gets Bob's brown present, and Alice gets Claire's white present.
2. **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets Claire's white present, and Claire gets Bob's brown present.
3. **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's brown present, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.

"The answer is **(A) orange ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Alice gets Claire's brown present, and Claire gets Alice's blue present. 

Since Alice started with a blue present, and then received a brown present from Claire, and then received an orange ball from Bob, Alice will end up with the orange ball.

"The answer is **(B)**. 

Here's why:

Let's break down the gift exchange:

1. **Initial State:** Alice has green, Bob has blue, and Claire has brown.
2. **Claire and Alice Swap:**  Claire's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Claire. This means Claire now has the green present, and Alice has the brown present.
3. **Claire and Bob Swap:** Claire's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Claire. This means Bob now has the green present, and Claire has the blue present.
4. **Alice and Claire Swap:** Alice's present goes to Claire, and Claire's present goes to Alice. This means Bob has the blue present.

So, the final state is:

* **Alice has Bob's present (red).**

"Okay, so let's think about this! 

Here's how the gift exchange works:

2. **Claire and Bob Swap:** Claire gives Bob her white ball, and Bob gives Claire her orange ball. Now Claire has the orange ball and Bob has the white ball.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can solve this:

* **Start:** Alice (red), Bob (black), Claire (white)
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. Again, we don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they exchange gifts. We don't know what they get, but we know the order is important.

The key is that the order of the swaps matters.  

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* **Scenario 1:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, then Claire would end up with the red present. 
* **Scenario 2:** If Bob and Alice swap, and then Alice and Claire swap, and then Claire and Bob swap, then Claire would end up with the black ball. 
* **Scenario 3:** If Bob and Claire swap, and then Alice and Bob swap, and then Claire and Alice swap, then Claire would end up with the white present. 

**Therefore, the answer is (C) black ball.**
