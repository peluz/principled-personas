**Can you help me figure out the answer?**

"Okay, let's figure this out!  We have a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

**Here's what we know:**

* **Clue 2:** The person who eats apples lives in the third house.
* **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
* **Clue 11:** The person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who drives a truck.

"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Clue 1:**  The person who drives a truck isn't in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV isn't in the third house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck isn't in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* We know the person with lilies isn't in house 1.
* We also know the person with the TV is in house 1.

So, the person with the computer must be in house 2. 

The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives to the left of the golfer.
* **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.

This means the golfer is in house 2, and the pizza eater is in house 1.

* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person with daffodils.

We know the pizza eater is in house 1, and the guitarist is to the right of the person with daffodils.  

So, the person with daffodils must be in house 2.  

The percussionist must be in house 1. 


**Answer:** The percussionist lives in **(B) 1**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We have a bunch of clues about where people live and what they like.  Let's see if we can figure out where the percussionist lives.

**Here's what we know:**

"Okay, let's break this down!

We know a few things:

* **House 1 and House 2 are next to each other.**
* **Someone ate stew and someone ate spaghetti.**
* **Someone likes white and someone likes red.**
* **Someone drinks water and someone drinks milk.**
* **Someone plays baseball and someone swims.**
* **Someone wears running shoes and someone wears loafers.**

Let's use the clues to figure out where the person in loafers lives!

**Clue 1:** The person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
**Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
**Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
**Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

**So, let's think about it:**

* The person who ate spaghetti is in house 1.
* The person who likes white is next to the person who ate spaghetti.
* The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other.
* The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti are next to each other.

**Now, let's look at the clues:**

* The person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
* The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
* The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

**So, the person who wears loafers lives in house 2!**


**Answer:** (A) 2 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

We know there are three houses, and each person has a different fruit and drink.  

* **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
* **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges doesn't live in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

Since the root beer lover doesn't live in the second house, and the person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house, the root beer lover can't be in house 2.

We also know the coffee drinker is to the left of the person eating mangos.  

The only house left for the root beer lover is house 3. 


**Answer:** The root beer lover lives in **(C) 3**. 
"
"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Clue 3:**  The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
* **Clue 4:** The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.

This means the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house, and the person wearing loafers is not in the first house.

* **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

We know the person who ate fried rice is not in the second house.  And we know the person wearing boots is to the left of the person who ate fried rice.

So, the person wearing boots must be in the third house. 

**Answer:** The person wearing loafers lives in house **(B) 1**.

* The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.

So, the person eating mangos must be in the first house!

We know the mystery book reader is in house 2, and the root beer lover is to the right of the rose bouquet person. So, the rose bouquet person must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** The cat lover doesn't live in the second house.

Let's put it all together!

"Okay, let's break this down!

We know the person in the second house wears high heels.  That's a big clue!

We also know the person in the third house wears running shoes.

Now, let's look at the other clues:

* The person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house.
* The person who likes milk doesn't live in the first house.
* The coffee drinker doesn't live in the second house.

So, the coffee drinker must live in the first house.

The person who likes milk must live in the third house because the person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

**Therefore, the person who wears high heels lives in the second house!**

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down:

* We know one person wears loafers and one wears high heels.
* We also know the person wearing loafers isn't in the first house.

This means the person wearing loafers has to be in the second house. 

The person wearing high heels can't be in the second house because the mystery book reader is in the first house. 

So, the person wearing loafers lives in house 2. 


**Answer:**  **B**

"Okay, so we have four houses and four people in each house.  We know some things about them:

* **Shoes:** One person wears boots, one wears running shoes, one wears high heels, and one wears sandals.

* **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives to the left of the person who wears sandals.
* **Clue 3:** The person who wears running shoes doesn't live in the third house.

* **Clue 1:** The person with the rose bouquet lives to the left of the person with the lilies.
* **Clue 2:** The saxophonist doesn't live in house 1.

Let's think about it:

* If the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 2, then the person with the lilies must live in house 1. 
* Since the saxophonist doesn't live in house 1, the person who plays the sax must live in house 2. 

So, the person eating apples lives in **house 2**.

**Here's what we know:**

* **Clue 1:**  The person wearing sandals is next to the person who owns horses.
* **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti is next to the person who likes history books.

**So, we can put the houses in order like this:**

```

**Answer:** The person who ate fried rice lives in house number 2. 


 
"
"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Clue 1:**  The person with a sedan lives to the left of the person with lilies.
* **Clue 2:** The flutist doesn't live in the first house.

We know the person with lilies lives in house 2.  

**Answer:**  The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in **2**. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 3:** The person with the carnations lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 6:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** There's one house between the daffodils person and the rose bouquet person.

-------|----|----|----
C  |  |  |  
R  |  |  |  
G  |  |  |  
T  |  |  |

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We have some clues about who lives where and what they like.  Let's see if we can figure out where the person who likes white lives.

* **Clue 7:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** There's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow.

This is helpful!  We know the person who ate fried rice is in the third house.  And we know there's one house between the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow.  

Let's think about the other clues.  We know the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.  We also know the person who had stew doesn't live in the second house. 

We can use this information to figure out the order of the houses.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  It's like a puzzle! 

Here's what we know:

* **We have four houses:**  So we need to figure out where each person lives.
* **They have different things:**  They play different instruments, like piano, violin, sax, and percussion. They also like different colors, sports, and drinks.
* **We need to find the pianist's house:**  That's our goal!

Let's start by looking for clues that tell us where people live.  

**Here's what I'm thinking:**

* **Clue 1:** There are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who eats apples.
* **Clue 2:** The baseball player doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
* **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
* **Clue 5:** There's one house between the person who eats grapes and the tennis player.
* **Clue 6:** There's one house between the percussionist and the person who likes green.
* **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
* **Clue 8:** There's one house between the person who likes blue and the person who eats oranges.
* **Clue 9:** There's one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker.
* **Clue 10:** The swimmer and the person who likes white live next to each other.
* **Clue 11:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
* **Clue 12:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

**Now, I need to figure out how to use these clues to find the pianist's house!** 


**What's the best way to do that?** 


 
"
"Let's figure this out! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 1:**  The person wearing high heels isn't in the third house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti isn't in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
* **Clue 5:** The person wearing boots is to the left of the person wearing high heels.
* **Clue 6:** The person wearing boots is to the left of the person who had stew.
* **Clue 7:** The person who had stew isn't in the second house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives. 

**So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house!** 


**Answer: (C) 1** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 5:** The person with the rose bouquet lives in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other.

This means the science fiction book fanatic has to be in the first house, and the rose bouquet person is in the second.

Now, let's look at the other clues:

* **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
* **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives to the right of the person with carnations.
* **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person with the vase of tulips.

We can use these clues to figure out where the romance book lover lives. 

The person with the carnations lives in house 3. 
The person with the vase of tulips lives in house 4.
The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.
The romance book lover lives in house 4.
The person with the lilies lives in house 2.



**So the answer is (D) 2.** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

* **Clue 1:**  The coffee drinker lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
* **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.  That means the coffee drinker has to be in the second house. 

So, the answer is **House 2**. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we know the percussionist lives next to the person with the radio.  That means the person with the phone has to be in the other house. 

The answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Clue 1:**  The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** There's a house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan.
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Let's think about it:

* We know the convertible person is in the second house.
* We know there's a house between the white person and the sedan person.
* We know the yellow person is to the left of the sedan person.

So, the white person has to be in the first house.  The yellow person has to be in the third house because they are to the left of the sedan person. 


**Answer:** The person who likes yellow lives in **(C) 3**.

* The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.
* The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
* The person who likes fantasy books lives in the second house.

So, the second house has both the person who likes fantasy books and the person who ate fried rice.  

The person who ate fried rice is in the second house, and the person who ate grilled cheese is in the third house. 

**Answer: 3** 



"
"Okay, so we know there are two houses, one with tulips and one with carnations.  The clue tells us the person with carnations lives to the left of the person with a dog.

* **Clue 1:**  The person who only drinks water lives next to the person wearing high heels.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing sandals lives next to the person who likes yellow.
* **Clue 3:** The person eating kiwis lives in house 2.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person wearing high heels lives.

**Think about it like a puzzle!**

* We know the person who only drinks water is next to the person wearing high heels.
* We also know the person wearing sandals is next to the person who likes yellow. 
* Since the person who likes yellow is next to the person wearing sandals, and the person who only drinks water is next to the person wearing high heels, we can figure out the order.

Let's think about it:

* We know the person wearing sandals and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
* The person wearing high heels is to the left of the person with a TV.

So, the person wearing sandals is to the left of the person eating grapes.  

The person who eats grapes is next to the person who wears sandals. 

The person who drinks tea is to the left of the person with a TV.

The only way to fit all of this is if the person who eats kiwis lives in house 1. 



**Answer: 1**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.
* The violinist doesn't live in the third house.

So, the violinist has to be in the second house, and the guitarist has to be in the third house. 

The answer is **(A) 2**.

"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 5:**  The person who likes red lives in the second house.
* **Clue 6:** The person who likes white lives to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

This means the person who is eating grapes has to be in a house to the right of the person who likes white.

We also know:

* **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.

This means the person who has a phone is in a house to the left of the person wearing running shoes.

Let's think about the other clues:

* **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
* **Clue 4:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

We can use these clues to figure out the order of the houses. 

**The answer is (B).**

"Okay, let's break this down!

We know a few things:

* **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
* **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other.

Let's think about where the golfer and the romance book lover could be.  

* **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other.

This means the golfer and the romance book lover are next to each other.

* **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other.

This means the person who is eating grapes is next to the tea drinker.

Now we know the saxophonist lives in the first house, the golfer and the romance book lover are next to each other, and the tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes are next to each other. 

**So, the person who is eating grapes lives in house 2!**

"Okay, let's break this down!

* **Clue 3:**  We know the person wearing boots lives in the first house. 
* **Clue 1:** The person with lilies doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The person with daffodils lives in the first house.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the person wearing boots lives.

**Think about it like this:**

* We know the person wearing boots is in the first house.
* We know the person with lilies is not in the second house.
* We know the person with high heels is not in the second house.
* We know the person with daffodils is in the first house.

**So, the person wearing boots must be in the first house!**


**Answer: (A) 1** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  It's like a puzzle! 

Here's what we know:

* **Lunch:** Spaghetti, grilled cheese, pizza, stew, fried rice
* **Shoes:** Loafers, running shoes, high heels, boots, sandals
* **Sports:** Golfer, soccer player, tennis player, cricketer, basketball player
* **Drinks:** Water, coffee, milk, tea, root beer

We need to figure out where the tea drinker lives.  Let's start by looking for clues that tell us something about the tea drinker's house.

**Here's what I'm thinking:**

* **Clue 5:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
* **Clue 9:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.

**Let's see if we can use these clues to figure out where the tea drinker lives!**

Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's break this down! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 1:** The person who eats grapes lives next to the person who drives a truck.
* **Clue 2:** The person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books.
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who drives a truck.

Let's use these clues to figure out where the fantasy book reader lives!

**Here's how I think about it:**

* **Clue 1** tells us the person who eats grapes is next to the person who drives a truck.
* **Clue 2** tells us the person wearing boots is next to the person who likes mystery books.
* **Clue 3** tells us the person who likes yellow is next to the person who drives a truck.

**So, let's put it all together:**

* The person who likes yellow is next to the person who drives a truck.
* The person wearing boots is next to the person who likes mystery books.
* The person who eats grapes is next to the person who drives a truck.

**The answer is:** The fantasy book reader lives in house 1.

"Pancakes can be a treat for cats, but they're not a good snack for them all the time. 

Here's why:

* **Pancakes are mostly carbs:**  Cats need a special diet with lots of protein and other good stuff for their bodies. 
* **Too much sugar and fat:**  Pancakes can be sugary and have lots of fat, which isn't good for cats.
* **Hard to digest:**  Pancakes can be hard for cats to digest, and they might get tummy aches.

So, it's best to give your cat pancakes only sometimes, and in small amounts.  It's always best to ask your parents or a grown-up if you're not sure if something is good for your cat. 


**Would you like to know more about what's good for cats to eat?**

**Here's the thing:**  It's kind of a mixed bag.  We definitely have art classes, and it's fun to draw and paint and stuff!  But sometimes, it doesn't get as much money as math or science.

"Okay, so you're wondering if lip piercings make your teeth more expensive to fix?  

The answer is probably **yes**.  Here's why:

* **Piercings can mess with your teeth:**  When you get a lip piercing, it can put pressure on your jaw, which can make your teeth move a little.  That can make it harder to chew and might even make your teeth not line up right.

* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's book is now Alice's, and Alice's book is now Eve's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Alice's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice's book is now Bob's, and Bob's book is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave's book is now Alice's, and Alice's book is now Dave's.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Dave's.

So, at the end, Alice has Dave's book.  What book did Dave get?  It was The Pearl! 


**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Eve and Bob swap balls, so Eve gets Bob's purple ball and Bob gets Eve's pink ball. 

Then Eve and Dave swap, so Eve gets Dave's pink ball and Dave gets Eve's purple ball.

Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's pink ball and Eve gets Alice's purple ball.

Then Alice and Claire swap, so Alice gets Claire's purple ball and Claire gets Alice's pink ball.

Finally, Claire and Dave swap, so Claire gets Dave's pink ball and Dave gets Claire's purple ball.

So, Dave ends up with the purple ball! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

Here's what we need to figure out:

* **Who gets what after each swap?**  We need to know who got what from each swap.

Let's think about the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  We don't know who got what.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  We don't know who got what.

We can't figure out who has what after each swap.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob and Alice switched partners, then Bob and Claire switched partners, and so on.  

The last step is Bob and Alice switching partners again.  

So, Claire is dancing with **Bob** at the end of the dance. 


The answer is **(B) Karl.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change Bob's gift.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gives Alice his green present, and Alice gives Bob her blue present.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Eve gives Dave her black ball, and Dave gives Eve her yellow present.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gives Eve her black ball, and Eve gives Bob her pink ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  Eve gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.

So, Bob ends up with the pink ball. 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps:

1. **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets a red ball and Claire gets a green ball.
2. **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice gets a red ball and Claire gets a green ball.
3. **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Bob gets a red ball and Alice gets a green ball.
4. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets a green ball and Dave gets a red ball.
5. **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Claire gets a red ball and Dave gets a green ball.

* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her orange ball, and Claire gives Alice her blue ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gives Bob his purple ball, and Bob gives Eve his green ball.

So, Claire ends up with the blue ball. 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve all started with a new book.  They trade books throughout the semester.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means they traded books, so they each got a new book.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They also traded books, so they each got a new book.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They traded books, so they each got a new book.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They traded books, so they each got a new book.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  They traded books, so they each got a new book.

So, Eve ends up with Moby Dick.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They traded books again.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  They traded books.

So, we need to figure out who has the book at the end.

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap their balls, so Alice gets Bob's yellow ball and Bob gets Alice's orange ball.
* **Eve and Alice:**  Eve and Alice swap, so Alice gets Eve's white ball and Eve gets Alice's yellow ball.
* **Bob and Dave:**  Bob and Dave swap, so Dave gets Bob's yellow ball and Bob gets Dave's blue ball.
* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap again, so Alice gets Bob's blue ball and Bob gets Alice's white ball.
* **Claire and Bob:**  Finally, Claire and Bob swap, so Bob gets Claire's red ball and Claire gets Bob's white ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the blue ball!

Then, Claire and Eve swap.  Who gets the orange ball?  It's Eve!

Then, Dave and Eve swap again.  Who gets the orange ball?  It's Dave!

Then, Claire and Dave swap again.  Who gets the orange ball?  It's Claire!

Finally, Alice and Bob swap.  Who gets the orange ball?  It's Bob!

So, the answer is **(D) blue ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see what happens:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they switch books.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  They switch books.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They switch books.

So, who has the book at the end?  Think about who traded with whom!

"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Dave is in the center, Bob is on the right, Claire is on the right wing, Alice is on the bench, and Eve is on the left wing.

* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave moves to the right wing, and Bob moves to the center.

* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice moves to the right wing, and Claire moves to the center.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire moves to the left wing, and Eve moves to the right wing.

* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob moves to the center, and Claire moves to the right wing.

* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave moves to the left wing, and Eve moves to the center.

* **Eve starts as the goalkeeper.**
* **Claire starts as the left midfielder.**
* **Dave starts as the left winger.**
* **Alice starts as the cheerleader.**
* **Bob starts as the right midfielder.**

Then, Eve and Claire switch places.  Eve becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the goalkeeper. 

Next, Alice and Dave switch places. Alice becomes the left winger, and Dave becomes the left midfielder.

Then, Bob and Eve switch places. Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Eve becomes the left winger.

Finally, Dave and Bob switch places. Dave becomes the left midfielder, and Bob becomes the left winger.

And then Bob and Eve switch places again. Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Eve becomes the left winger.

So, Claire is now playing the left winger! 


**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Alice switch partners, and then Dave and Claire switch partners.  This means that Dave is now dancing with Claire.  Then, Bob and Claire switch partners.  

So, the final answer is **(D) Ophelia**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

1. **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Dave's ball.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Bob's ball.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Claire's ball.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
5. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Claire's ball.

So, at the end, everyone has swapped their balls.  

**The answer is (D) the green ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Alice** starts with ""The Pearl"".
* **Bob** starts with ""The Odyssey"".
* **Claire** starts with ""Ulysses"".
* **Dave** starts with ""Moby Dick"".
* **Eve** starts with ""Frankenstein"".

They trade books, and we need to figure out who gets which book at the end. 

Let me know if you want to try another one! 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so they switch colors.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets Claire's ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap again, so they switch colors back.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice gets Dave's ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Dave gives Eve his ball.

So, Eve ends up with the brown ball! 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  Bob is on the bench, Alice is the right winger, Claire is the right midfielder, Dave is the goalie, and Eve is cheering.

* **Trade 1:** Bob and Alice switch places.  Bob becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.

* **Trade 2:** Dave and Claire switch places. Dave becomes the right midfielder, and Claire becomes the goalie.

* **Trade 3:** Alice and Claire switch places. Alice becomes the goalie, and Claire becomes the right winger.

* **Trade 4:** Eve and Alice switch places. Eve becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the goalie.

* **Trade 5:** Dave and Bob switch places. Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalie.

**So, at the end of the game, Bob is the goalie!** 


The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means they traded books.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They also traded books.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They traded books.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They traded books again.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  They traded books.

So, Claire ends up with the book she traded with Eve. 

The answer is **(E) Ulysses**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Claire and Bob switched partners, then Dave and Alice switched partners, and then Dave and Bob switched partners again.  Then Alice and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Eve and Claire switched partners. 

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Rodrigo**
* **(B) Izzi**
* **(C) Jamie**
* **(D) Helga**
* **(E) Patrick** 


 
The answer is **(B) Izzi**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve each started with a different color present.  They all swap gifts, and we need to figure out who has the purple present at the end. 

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know they swapped colors.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know they swapped colors.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know they swapped colors.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know they swapped colors.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** We don't know what they swapped, but we know they swapped colors.

**So, we can't figure out who has the purple present at the end.** 


**The answer is (None of the above)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Sam, and Claire is with Bob. Then, Bob and Eve switch partners, so Bob is now with Eve, and Eve is with Sam.  

Next, Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Eve, and Bob is with Melissa. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Bob, and Bob is with Melissa. Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Dave, and Claire is with Bob. 

So, Bob is dancing with Melissa at the end of the dance. 


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:** Alice has brown, Bob has white, Claire has black, Dave has red, and Eve has purple.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Bob and Claire swap again:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change anything.

So, Claire still has the black ball! 

**Answer: (E) black ball** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then, they trade books with each other.  Let's see how the trades go:

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  Eve and Claire switch books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve switch books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire and Dave switch books.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob and Eve switch books again.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice and Bob switch books.

Now, we need to figure out who has the book at the end.  

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Jamie, Claire is with Melissa, Dave is with Lola, and Eve is with Ophelia.

* **Bob and Claire switch:**  This means Bob is now with someone else, and Claire is with someone else.
* **Alice and Dave switch:** This means Alice is now with someone else, and Dave is with someone else.
* **Bob and Alice switch:** This means Bob is now with someone else, and Alice is with someone else.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** This means Claire is now with someone else, and Eve is with someone else.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** This means Eve is now with someone else, and Alice is with someone else.

So, to figure out who Eve is dancing with at the end, we need to figure out who is dancing with who after all the switches.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets Bob's pink ball, and Bob gets Claire's black ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets Dave's orange ball, and Dave gets Bob's pink ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Claire's black ball, and Claire gets Eve's brown present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Alice's red present, and Alice gets Bob's pink ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets Claire's black ball, and Claire gets Dave's orange ball.

So, Claire ends up with the black ball! 

The answer is **(C) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:** Eve is on the right wing, Claire is the striker, Dave is the left midfielder, Alice is the cheerleader, and Bob is the goalkeeper.

* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the striker.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve becomes the left midfielder, and Claire becomes the right winger.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the striker.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.

So, at the end of the game, Eve is playing the **left midfielder**. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Eve starts with a white ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with a blue ball, and Claire starts with a brown ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a blue ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Eve starts with a white ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a white ball, and Claire starts with a blue ball.

* **Second trade:** Eve and Bob switch places.
* **Third trade:** Claire and Dave switch places.

1. Bob and Alice swap books.
2. Claire and Dave swap books.
3. Eve and Dave swap books.
4. Bob and Dave swap books.
5. Eve and Bob swap books.

So, Eve's book is the one that gets swapped the most.

* Alice and Eve swap. Eve gets Alice's black ball.
* Dave and Claire swap. Claire gets Dave's yellow ball.
* Dave and Eve swap. Eve gets Dave's yellow ball.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire gets the red ball and Bob gets the brown ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets the orange ball and Eve gets the black ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the blue ball.

* **(B) Melissa**
* **(C) Jamie**
* **(D) Rodrigo**
* **(E) Patrick**

* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a green ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.

So, Dave ends up with the yellow ball! 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:**  We have Alice (yellow), Bob (red), Claire (green), Dave (orange), and Eve (black).
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the colors, just who has the gift.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This changes who has the gift.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This changes who has the gift again.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  This changes who has the gift.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This changes who has the gift.

"
"Let's figure out what book Dave ends up with!

* **Start:**  Alice has Ulysses, Bob has Frankenstein, Claire has Moby Dick, Dave has Lolita, and Eve has The Pearl.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave now has Frankenstein, and Bob has Lolita.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire now has Lolita, and Bob has The Pearl.

* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Eve now has The Pearl, and Bob has Lolita.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  Dave now has Lolita, and Alice has The Pearl.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Dave and Eve switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners again.
* Alice and Eve switch partners.
* Dave and Bob switch partners.

The last dance is with Dave and Bob.  So, Dave is dancing with Patrick. 


**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's present.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Eve's present and Eve gets Claire's present.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Dave's present and Dave gets Bob's present.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's present.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Dave's present and Dave gets Alice's present.

So, the final gift is the one that Dave had. 

**The answer is (E) red present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve gets Dave's book, Alice gets Eve's book.
* **Bob and Eve trade:** Bob gets Eve's book, Eve gets Bob's book.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire gets Dave's book, Dave gets Claire's book.

So, the last trade is between Claire and Bob.  

**The question is: What book does Dave have at the end?**

The answer is **(D) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve each started with a different color present.  They all swap gifts, and we need to figure out what Alice has at the end. 

Here's how we can figure it out:

* **First Swap:**  Claire and Alice swap.
* **Second Swap:** Claire and Dave swap.
* **Third Swap:** Alice and Bob swap.
* **Fourth Swap:** Eve and Dave swap.
* **Fifth Swap:** Bob and Claire swap.

We don't know what color Alice has at the end, but we can figure it out! 


**Answer:**  The answer is **(C) pink ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Alice and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so Eve gets Alice's yellow present and Alice gets Eve's green present.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap gifts, so Dave gets Bob's orange present and Bob gets Dave's purple present.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap gifts again, so Eve gets Bob's green present and Bob gets Eve's orange present.
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap gifts, so Eve gets Claire's red present and Claire gets Eve's green present.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap gifts, so Alice gets Dave's orange present and Dave gets Alice's purple present.

So, Dave ends up with the green present! 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Eve starts with Moby Dick.  Then, Eve and Dave trade, so Dave gets Moby Dick and Eve gets Catch-22.  

Then, Claire and Eve trade, so Claire gets Moby Dick and Eve gets Ulysses.

Dave and Bob trade, so Dave gets The Odyssey and Bob gets Catch-22.

Then, Eve and Alice trade, so Eve gets Ulysses and Alice gets Moby Dick.

Finally, Bob and Claire trade, so Bob gets Ulysses and Claire gets The Odyssey.

So, Eve ends up with Ulysses! 

**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions. 

* **Start:** Alice is on the left wing, Bob is on the left midfield, Claire is in the center midfield, Dave is on the right wing, and Eve is the striker.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave moves to the striker position, and Eve moves to the right wing.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave moves to the left wing, and Alice moves to the striker position.
* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob moves to the center midfield, and Alice moves to the left wing.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire moves to the left wing, and Alice moves to the center midfield.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing in the center midfield. 

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob's present becomes Dave's present, and Dave's present becomes Bob's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Dave's present, and Dave's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Eve's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's present, and Bob's present becomes Alice's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave's present becomes Claire's present, and Claire's present becomes Dave's present.

So, after all the swaps, Claire has the present that was originally Dave's. 

The answer is **(D) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Alice and Claire switch partners a few times.  Then Dave and Eve switch partners.  

The last step is important!  Dave and Bob switch partners.  

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Melissa**
* **(B) Izzi**
* **(C) Lola**
* **(D) Patrick**
* **(E) Rodrigo** 


 
The answer is **(D)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob and Eve switched partners, then Alice and Bob switched partners, and then Eve and Bob switched partners again.  Then, Dave and Alice switched partners. Finally, Eve and Claire switched partners. 

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (A) Ophelia 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  We know Bob is in the center midfielder spot, Claire is the fullback, Dave is the striker, Alice is the benchwarmer, and Eve is the left winger.

* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave moves to the left winger spot, and Eve moves to the striker spot.

* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave moves to the fullback spot, and Claire moves to the striker spot.

* **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve moves to the left winger spot, and Dave moves to the striker spot.

* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob moves to the benchwarmer spot, and Alice moves to the center midfielder spot.

**So, Bob is now the benchwarmer!** 


The answer is **(E) benchwarmer**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps:

1. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Bob's blue ball.
2. **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice gets Dave's green ball and Dave gets Alice's blue ball.
3. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave gets Claire's yellow ball and Claire gets Dave's red ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets Bob's yellow ball and Bob gets Claire's blue ball.
5. **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob gets Eve's brown ball and Eve gets Bob's yellow ball.

So, Eve ends up with the brown ball! 

The answer is **(D)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Bob:** They swap balls, so they each get a different color.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap balls, so they each get a different color.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap balls, so they each get a different color.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap balls, so they each get a different color.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap balls, so they each get a different color.

So, the colors keep changing!  

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:**  We have Alice (green), Bob (blue), Claire (red), Dave (yellow), and Eve (purple).
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  So now Claire has the green present, and Alice has the red present.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets the purple present, and Eve gets the blue present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice gets the blue present, and Dave gets the purple present.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets the purple present, and Dave gets the blue present.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets the red present, and Eve gets the yellow present.

So, Dave ends up with the yellow present! 


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* Alice starts with a black ball.
* She trades with Eve, so she gets Eve's ball.
* Dave and Claire swap, so Dave gets Claire's ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Eve gets Dave's ball.
* Claire and Eve swap, so Eve gets Claire's ball.
* Bob and Eve swap, so Eve gets Bob's ball.

So, Eve ends up with all the balls!  

The answer is **(E) green ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob's ball is now Alice's, and Alice's ball is now Bob's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Now Alice has Claire's ball, and Claire has Alice's ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's ball is now Alice's, and Alice's ball is now Eve's.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire's ball is now Bob's, and Bob's ball is now Claire's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire's ball is now Dave's, and Dave's ball is now Claire's.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the **green ball**.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Claire and Bob switched partners, then Claire and Eve switched partners, and so on.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire is with Lola, Bob is with Izzi.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire is with Sam, Eve is with Izzi.

"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Eve and Alice:** They swap gifts, so Eve gets Alice's present and Alice gets Eve's.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap gifts, so Claire gets Bob's present and Bob gets Claire's.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap gifts, so Alice gets Bob's present and Bob gets Alice's.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap gifts, so Alice gets Eve's present and Eve gets Alice's.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap gifts, so Dave gets Bob's present and Bob gets Dave's.

Now, think about it this way: Bob started with a black ball.  He gets a new present from someone else, and then he gets a new present from someone else.  

**The answer is (C) black ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with blue, Alice starts with yellow. They swap, so Eve gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets the red ball, Claire gets the blue ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gets the red ball, Eve gets the blue ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets the red ball, Claire gets the blue ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets the red ball, Alice gets the blue ball.

"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades.  

* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave goes to the left midfielder spot, and Alice goes to the right midfielder spot.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve goes to the right midfielder spot, and Bob goes to the left winger spot.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire goes to the right midfielder spot, and Dave goes to the left winger spot.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice goes to the left winger spot, and Eve goes to the right midfielder spot.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice goes to the fullback spot, and Bob goes to the left winger spot.

"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means Claire gets a new ball, and Eve gets a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

So, at the end of the game, Bob has the ball that was originally Claire's. 

The answer is **(C) brown ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:** Alice has brown, Bob has black, Claire has green, Dave has purple, and Eve has yellow.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts, so now Bob has purple and Dave has black.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  They switch gifts again, so Bob has black and Eve has yellow.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch gifts, so Dave has black and Claire has green.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts again, so Dave has purple and Bob has black.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Finally, Alice and Dave switch gifts, and now Dave has purple.

So, the answer is **(D) purple**.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, Eve becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire becomes the left midfielder, Dave becomes the striker.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve becomes the right winger, Claire becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire becomes the goalkeeper, Alice becomes the right winger.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the left midfielder, Dave becomes the goalkeeper.

So, at the end of the game, Claire is the goalkeeper! 


**Answer:** (C) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Eve and Dave swap balls first, so Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball. Then Alice and Dave swap, so Alice gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Alice's ball.  Then Alice and Claire swap, so Claire gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Claire's ball.  Finally, Dave and Bob swap, so Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball. 

So, the final ball holder is Claire. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They trade books, so they both have a book they didn't get at the beginning.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They also trade books, so they both have a book they didn't get at the beginning.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They trade books, so they both have a book they didn't get at the beginning.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  They trade books, so they both have a book they didn't get at the beginning.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Eve gets Dave's book, which was Catch-22.

So, Eve has Catch-22! 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Jamie switch partners, and then Dave and Bob switch partners.  So, Eve is now dancing with Jamie. 

The answer is **(E) Jamie**. 



"
"Let's think about who gets which book!

* **Alice starts with Frankenstein.**
* **Bob gets Ulysses.**
* **Claire gets The Odyssey.**
* **Dave gets The Pearl.**
* **Eve gets Lolita.**

Now, let's see how the books get swapped around:

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets Lolita, Eve gets Ulysses.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets The Pearl, Bob gets Ulysses.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets The Odyssey, Claire gets Ulysses.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They trade books again.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  They trade books again.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  They trade books.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They trade books again.

So, at the end, Eve has Catch-22. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Alice switch partners, so Dave is now with Lola, and Alice is with Sam. Then Eve and Alice switch, so Eve is now with Dave, and Alice is with Karl. 

Then Bob and Dave switch, so Bob is now with Claire, and Dave is with Eve.  

Then Bob and Eve switch, so Bob is now with Patrick, and Eve is with Karl. 

Finally, Bob and Claire switch, so Bob is now with Sam, and Claire is with Dave. 

So, Claire is dancing with Sam! 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  Dave is a left winger, Claire is the goalkeeper, Alice is a left midfielder, Bob is the striker, and Eve is a cheerleader.

* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Claire becomes a left winger.

* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve becomes a left midfielder, and Alice becomes a cheerleader.

* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.

* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve becomes the striker, and Alice becomes a left midfielder.

* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve becomes a left winger, and Bob becomes the striker.

**So, at the end of the game, Dave is playing left winger.** 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Dave and Bob:**  Dave starts with purple, Bob starts with black. They swap, so Bob now has purple and Dave has black.
* **Alice and Dave:**  Dave now has black, Alice has purple. They swap, so Alice now has black and Dave has purple.
* **Bob and Eve:**  Bob now has purple, Eve has green. They swap, so Eve now has purple and Bob has green.
* **Dave and Claire:**  Dave now has purple, Claire has yellow. They swap, so Claire now has purple and Dave has yellow.
* **Alice and Eve:**  Alice now has purple, Eve has green. They swap, so Eve now has purple and Alice has green.

So, Bob ends up with the green present! 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets a white present and Claire gets a black ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets an orange ball and Eve gets a white present.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets a black ball and Claire gets an orange ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets a green present and Alice gets a black ball.

We know that Bob, Dave, Claire, Alice, and Eve all got new books at the start of the semester.  They then trade books throughout the semester. 

Here's what we know:

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means they both get each other's books.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**
* **Dave and Claire swap:**
* **Claire and Bob swap:**
* **Alice and Eve swap:**

Let's think about what this means for Bob.  He started with Frankenstein.  He traded with Dave, then with Claire.  Then, he traded with Claire again.  Finally, he traded with Alice. 

**So, the answer is (E) Ulysses.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Bob switch partners, so Eve is now with Rodrigo. Then Alice and Bob switch, so Alice is now with Melissa.  Dave and Eve switch, so Dave is now with Claire. Then Eve and Claire switch, so Eve is now with Rodrigo again. Finally, Alice and Claire switch, so Alice is now with Dave. 

So, Alice is dancing with Dave at the end. 

The answer is (C).

So, who is Eve dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (B) Patrick 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means they traded their gifts.  We don't know what they traded, but we know the colors are now mixed up.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Again, they traded gifts.  We don't know what they traded, but the colors are now mixed up.

* **Bob** starts with *Catch-22*.
* **Claire** starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* **Dave** starts with *Ulysses*.

3. **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books again.
4. **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch books.

So, Eve's present is the one that was originally hers.  

The answer is **(D) black ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Alice has green, Bob has white, Claire has black, Dave has orange, and Eve has yellow.

So, Dave is dancing with **Alice** at the end of the dance.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Dave and Eve traded books, so Dave got Frankenstein and Eve got Ulysses. Then, Bob and Dave traded, so Dave got Moby Dick and Bob got Ulysses. 

Claire and Bob traded, so Bob got The Pearl and Claire got Moby Dick. Then, Alice and Bob traded, so Bob got The Fellowship of the Ring and Alice got The Pearl. Finally, Claire and Eve traded, so Claire got The Fellowship of the Ring and Eve got The Pearl.

So, at the end, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Bob has *Moby Dick*.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They switch books, so now Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Dave has *Catch-22*.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice and Eve switch books, so now Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Eve has *Frankenstein*.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob and Eve switch books, so Bob now has *Frankenstein*.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave and Bob switch books, so Dave now has *Catch-22*.

**So, Bob ends up with Frankenstein!** 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Alice** starts with *Catch-22*.
* **Bob** starts with *The Odyssey*.
* **Claire** starts with *Moby Dick*.
* **Dave** starts with *Lolita*.
* **Eve** starts with *Frankenstein*.

Now, let's see how they trade:

1. **Claire and Eve swap books.**  This means they switch books.
2. **Alice and Bob swap books.**
3. **Bob and Eve swap books.**
4. **Eve and Alice swap books.**
5. **Bob and Dave swap books.**

So, who gets *Lolita* at the end? 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:**  Alice has a red ball, Bob has a pink ball, Claire has a brown ball, Dave has a yellow ball, and Eve has an orange ball.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets a brown ball, and Claire gets a pink ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets an orange ball, and Eve gets a brown ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice gets a yellow ball, and Dave gets a red ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets a red ball, and Alice gets a yellow ball.

**So, in the end, Alice has the yellow ball!** 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, we know Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Claire and Dave switch partners.  Then, Eve and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Claire and Dave switch partners again. 

So, Eve is dancing with Karl at the end. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:**  Alice has purple, Bob has white, Claire has yellow, Dave has pink, and Eve has green.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts again.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts one last time.

Now, think about it:  The gifts are just being swapped, not changing colors.  So, who has the gift that was originally Claire's? 

**The answer is (B) yellow.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  This means Dave gets a new gift, and Bob gets a new gift.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means they each get a new gift.

So, let's think about who has the gift that was originally Claire's. 


**The answer is (E) pink ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Bob's ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Alice's ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Eve's ball.

So, Eve ends up with the blue ball. 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's orange ball and Alice gets Bob's yellow ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's white ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Bob gets Dave's blue ball and Dave gets Bob's orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap again, so Bob gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Bob's orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so Claire gets Bob's orange ball and Bob gets Claire's red ball.

So, Bob ends up with the red ball! 


The answer is **(D).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Alice:**  Dave starts with a pink ball, Alice starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Dave gets the brown ball and Alice gets the pink ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice has the pink ball, Claire has the orange ball. They swap, so Claire gets the pink ball and Alice gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire has the pink ball, Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the pink ball and Claire gets the blue ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve has the white ball, Bob has the blue ball. They swap, so Bob gets the white ball and Eve gets the blue ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice has the orange ball, Dave has the pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the orange ball and Alice gets the pink ball.

So, Bob ends up with the white ball. 


**Answer: (A)**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Dave and Claire switch partners.
* Dave and Bob switch partners.
* Dave and Claire switch partners again.
* Dave and Eve switch partners.

It looks like Dave and Claire switch partners a few times.  Let's see if we can figure out who Alice is dancing with at the end. 


**The answer is (E) Patrick.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that at the start, Dave is with Helga, Alice is with Jamie, Bob is with Patrick, Claire is with Karl, and Eve is with Izzi. 

Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.  So Claire is now with Bob, and Alice is with Dave.

Then, Alice and Dave switch partners.  So Alice is now with Bob, and Dave is with Claire.

Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  So Alice is now with Dave, and Bob is with Claire.

Then, Bob and Eve switch partners.  So Bob is now with Eve, and Dave is with Claire.

Finally, Dave and Bob switch partners.  So Dave is now with Eve, and Bob is with Claire.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Eve. 


The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with each other.  

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's gift is now Alice's, and Alice's gift is now Claire's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  This means Dave's gift is now Bob's, and Bob's gift is now Dave's.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave's gift is now Claire's, and Claire's gift is now Dave's.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's gift is now Alice's, and Alice's gift is now Claire's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve's gift is now Alice's, and Alice's gift is now Eve's.

So, the final gift is the one that was in Eve's hand at the end.  

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Claire and Bob switched partners a few times.  Let's see who they end up with:

* **Claire and Bob switch:**  Claire - Sam, Bob - Izzi
* **Claire and Alice switch:**  Claire - Patrick, Alice - Sam
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve - Patrick, Bob - Izzi
* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave - Izzi, Claire - Patrick

So, Bob is dancing with Izzi at the end! 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players start in these positions:

* Alice - Goalkeeper
* Bob - Striker
* Claire - Cheerleader
* Dave - Center Midfielder
* Eve - Right Midfielder

Here's what happens:

1. Eve and Dave switch places.
2. Dave and Bob switch places.
3. Dave and Claire switch places.
4. Dave and Bob switch places again.
5. Alice and Bob switch places.

So, let's see where Bob ends up:

* **Bob starts as Striker**
* **Dave becomes Striker**
* **Dave becomes Center Midfielder**
* **Dave becomes Cheerleader**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  Eve gives Claire her book.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gives Bob her book.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gives Alice her book.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Dave gives Bob his book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Bob gives Eve her book.

So, who has Claire's book?  

**The answer is (D) Hound of the Baskervilles.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

First, we know who got what book at the start.  

* Alice got Lolita
* Bob got Catch-22
* Claire got The Pearl
* Dave got Frankenstein
* Eve got The Great Gatsby

Then, they trade books.  Let's see what happens:

* Eve and Alice swap books.
* Alice and Bob swap books.
* Claire and Bob swap books.
* Eve and Dave swap books.
* Bob and Claire swap books.

Now, we need to figure out who has The Pearl at the end.  

The answer is **(C) The Pearl**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  Dave is the benchwarmer, Eve is the goalie, Alice is the striker, Bob is the fullback, and Claire is the cheerleader.
* **Alice and Eve switch:**  Alice becomes the goalie, and Eve becomes the striker.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave becomes the fullback, and Bob becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, and Dave becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave becomes the goalie, and Eve becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Dave is the goalie! 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Alice switch partners, so Eve is now with Bob, and Alice is with Dave. Then, Dave and Claire switch, so Dave is now with Eve, and Claire is with Bob.  Claire and Eve switch again, so Claire is now with Dave, and Eve is with Bob.  Then, Bob and Alice switch, so Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is with Dave. Finally, Bob and Dave switch, so Bob is now with Eve, and Dave is with Claire. 

So, Dave is dancing with Claire at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Dave and Alice switch partners:**  This means Dave now dances with Lola, and Alice now dances with Karl.
* **Claire and Dave switch partners:** This means Claire now dances with Melissa, and Dave now dances with Helga.
* **Alice and Dave switch partners:** This means Alice now dances with Sam, and Dave now dances with Helga.
* **Bob and Eve switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Melissa, and Eve now dances with Sam.
* **Bob and Alice switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Helga, and Alice now dances with Sam.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Sam. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the cheerleader, Bob is the goalie, Claire is the striker, Dave is the left midfielder, and Eve is the right winger.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the striker.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve becomes the left midfielder, and Claire becomes the right winger.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the right winger.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalie.

So, at the end, Alice is playing the right winger!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

First, Dave and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners.  Then, Eve and Alice switch partners.  Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.  Finally, Alice and Eve switch partners. 

Eve ends up with Rodrigo. 

So the answer is (D).

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  Claire is the goalie, Dave is on the left wing, Alice is the right midfielder, Bob is on the bench, and Eve is in the center.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve is now the midfielder, Alice is on the right.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave is now on the left, Alice is on the right.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice is now the midfielder, Eve is on the right.

* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now in the center, Claire is on the left.

So, Claire is now in the **center**! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This doesn't change anything about Claire's or Eve's gifts.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire now has Bob's purple present, and Bob now has Claire's orange ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Alice now has Dave's pink ball, and Dave now has Alice's brown present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob now has Claire's orange ball, and Claire now has Bob's purple present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob now has Alice's brown present, and Alice now has Bob's purple present.

So, Claire ends up with the purple present.

Eve and Bob swap books, so Eve gets Bob's book and Bob gets Eve's book.  Then Alice and Claire swap books, so Alice gets Claire's book and Claire gets Alice's book.  Then Alice and Dave swap books, so Alice gets Dave's book and Dave gets Alice's book.  Then Claire and Dave swap books, so Claire gets Dave's book and Dave gets Claire's book.  Finally, Bob and Claire swap books, so Bob gets Claire's book and Claire gets Bob's book.

So, Eve has The Odyssey. 

**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they trade books throughout the semester. 

Here's what we know:

* Eve and Bob swap books.
* Dave and Alice swap books.
* Bob and Claire swap books.
* Alice and Dave swap books.
* Claire and Bob swap books.

Let's think about who would have the book at the end.  

**The answer is (A) Frankenstein.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Claire switch partners, so Claire is now with Dave. Then, Claire and Dave switch partners, so Claire is with Ophelia.  Then, Claire and Alice switch partners, so Claire is with Patrick.  Then, Bob and Alice switch partners, so Bob is with Izzi. Finally, Dave and Claire switch partners, so Claire is with Izzi. 

So the answer is Izzi. 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Alice starts with yellow.**
* **Bob starts with orange.**
* **Claire starts with red.**
* **Dave starts with purple.**
* **Eve starts with green.**

Now, let's see what happens when they swap gifts:

1. **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice gets green, and Eve gets yellow.
2. **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets purple, and Dave gets orange.
3. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets yellow, and Eve gets purple.
4. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets yellow, and Eve gets red.
5. **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gets red, and Alice gets orange.

So, Alice ends up with the orange ball! 


The answer is **(C).**

* **Eve and Bob switch places.**  Eve becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the left midfielder.
* **Eve and Dave switch places.** Eve becomes the right midfielder, and Dave becomes the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve switch places.** Alice becomes the left midfielder, and Eve becomes the right winger.
* **Bob and Claire switch places.** Bob becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the right winger.

So, Eve ends up playing right winger! 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Eve switch partners, then Eve and Claire switch partners.  Then Alice and Dave switch partners.  Then Claire and Eve switch partners again.  Finally, Eve and Bob switch partners. 

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Izzi**
* **(B) Karl**
* **(C) Patrick**
* **(D) Jamie**
* **(E) Rodrigo** 


 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Dave and Claire:** They swap gifts, so Claire gets Dave's present and Dave gets Claire's.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap gifts, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap gifts, so Claire gets Alice's present and Alice gets Claire's.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap gifts, so Alice gets Eve's present and Eve gets Alice's.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap gifts, so Dave gets Bob's present and Bob gets Dave's.

Now, think about who has the orange ball at the end. 


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap again, so Alice now has Claire's ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap again, so Alice now has Bob's ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap one last time, so Alice now has Claire's ball.

So, Alice ends up with Claire's ball, which is blue. 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

* **First trade:** Claire and Dave switch places.  
* **Second trade:** Dave and Bob switch places.
* **Third trade:** Alice and Bob switch places.
* **Fourth trade:** Eve and Dave switch places.
* **Fifth trade:** Alice and Dave switch places.

So, Dave ends up playing fullback. 

The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Bob, Alice, Claire, Dave, and Eve all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they trade books throughout the semester. 

Here's what we know:

* **Bob** starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* **Alice** starts with *The Pearl*.
* **Claire** starts with *Moby Dick*.
* **Dave** starts with *Lolita*.
* **Eve** starts with *The Odyssey*.

Let's see how the trades go:

1. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets *The Pearl*, Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets *Lolita*, Dave gets *Moby Dick*.
3. **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets *Moby Dick*, Dave gets *Lolita*.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets *Lolita*, Dave gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
5. **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob gets *The Odyssey*.

So, at the end of the semester, Bob has *The Odyssey*. 


**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  Alice is on the bench, Bob is in the right midfield, Claire is cheering, Dave is the striker, and Eve is on the left wing.

* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice goes to the bench, and Eve goes to the left wing.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire goes to the left wing, and Alice goes to the bench.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve goes to the bench, and Alice goes to the left wing.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the striker, and Dave becomes the left wing.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing the striker! 


**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we know who's dancing with who at the start.  Then, we see some partners switch.  

* Claire and Dave switch partners.
* Eve and Bob switch partners.
* Claire and Alice switch partners.
* Eve and Alice switch partners.
* Claire and Dave switch partners again.

So, who is Dave dancing with at the end?  

a) Sam
b) Karl
c) Melissa
d) Lola
e) Izzi 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present is now with Alice, and Alice's present is now with Claire.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Bob.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Alice.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob's present is now with Dave, and Dave's present is now with Bob.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave's present is now with Eve, and Eve's present is now with Dave.

So, Eve ends up with the green present. 


**Answer:** (E) 



"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps:

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets a new ball, and Claire gets a new ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice gets a new ball, and Bob gets a new ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This means Eve gets a new ball, and Dave gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire gets a new ball, and Bob gets a new ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets a new ball, and Eve gets a new ball.

So, at the end, Eve has the black ball. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:** Eve is the left midfielder, Bob is the striker, Claire is the benchwarmer, Dave is the fullback, and Alice is the right winger.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave becomes the left midfielder, and Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the left midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice becomes the left midfielder, and Claire becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice becomes the fullback, and Dave becomes the left midfielder.

So, Eve is now the right winger! 


**Answer:** (D) 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets Alice's present and Alice gets Dave's present.
* **Claire and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets Claire's present and Claire gets Dave's present.
* **Dave and Eve:**  They swap gifts, so Eve gets Dave's present and Dave gets Eve's present.
* **Bob and Dave:**  They swap gifts, so Dave gets Bob's present and Bob gets Dave's present.
* **Dave and Claire:**  They swap gifts, so Claire gets Dave's present and Dave gets Claire's present.

So, Dave ends up with the white present.  

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners.  Here's what we know:

* **Bob and Dave switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Claire and Bob switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Eve and Dave switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:**  This means they swap places.

**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Ulysses*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *The Odyssey*.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they traded books, but we don't know who got which book.

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means they traded books, but we don't know who got which book.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means they traded books, but we don't know who got which book.

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means they traded books, but we don't know who got which book.

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This means they traded books, but we don't know who got which book.

**The only way to figure out who has what book is to look at the final order.** 

**The answer is (E) Ulysses.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see what happens:

* **Alice** gets Moby Dick.
* **Bob** gets Lolita.
* **Claire** gets The Great Gatsby.
* **Dave** gets Catch-22.
* **Eve** gets Ulysses.

Now, let's see how the trades go:

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means they trade books.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They trade books again.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They trade books.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They trade books again.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  They trade books.

So, after all the trades, who has Ulysses? 

**Answer: (E) Ulysses** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Eve starts with a pink ball.  Then, Eve and Alice swap gifts.  Alice gets the pink ball, so Eve gets the green present.  

Next, Dave and Bob swap gifts.  Dave gets the orange ball, and Bob gets the red present.

Then, Claire and Dave swap gifts.  Claire gets the red present, and Dave gets the white present.

Finally, Eve and Claire swap gifts.  Eve gets the white present, and Claire gets the pink ball.

So, Eve ends up with the pink ball. 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob and Eve switched partners, then Alice and Bob switched partners.  Then Dave and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switched partners.  

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (C) Jamie 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **(A) Jamie**
* **(B) Karl**
* **(C) Izzi**
* **(D) Ophelia**
* **(E) Lola** 


 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:** Alice has red, Bob has yellow, Claire has green, Dave has pink, and Eve has white.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Now Claire has red and Alice has green.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave has pink and Eve has white.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob has yellow and Dave has pink.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Eve has white and Dave has pink.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  Dave has pink and Alice has red.

So, Alice ends up with the red present! 


The answer is **(E) red present**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that Bob and Alice traded balls first.  Then Alice and Claire traded.  Eve and Alice traded.  Then Claire and Bob traded.  Finally, Claire and Dave traded. 

If we look at the pattern, it seems like the person who traded with Eve and Alice got the ball that Eve had.  So, the person who got the green ball from Eve is the one who ends up with it. 

The answer is **(D) green ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are:

* Alice: Cheerleader

Here's what happens:

1. Claire and Dave switch places.
2. Dave and Bob switch places.

1. Alice and Bob switch places.
2. Dave and Bob switch places.
3. Alice and Claire switch places.

**So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing the cheerleader.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve are all dancing with someone.  They switch partners a few times.  

* Alice and Dave switch partners.
* Alice and Claire switch partners.
* Alice and Eve switch partners.
* Bob and Dave switch partners.
* Dave and Claire switch partners.

Let's see who Alice ends up with! 


**Answer:**  (C) Karl 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire's ball is now Dave's, and Dave's ball is now Claire's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's ball is now Bob's, and Bob's ball is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This means Alice's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This means Claire's ball is now Eve's, and Eve's ball is now Claire's.

It looks like the balls are being swapped in a circle.  So, the person who ends up with the ball is the one who had it at the beginning.  

**The answer is (A) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice has *Lolita*, Bob has *The Great Gatsby*, Claire has *Ulysses*, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, and Eve has *The Odyssey*.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  They switch books.  
* **Eve and Claire swap:** They switch books.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** They switch books again.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** They switch books.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** They switch books.

**The final answer:**  We don't know for sure who has which book at the end. 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap gifts, so Alice gets Bob's present (white) and Bob gets Alice's present (green).
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap gifts, so Eve gets Alice's present (green) and Alice gets Eve's present (yellow).
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap gifts, so Eve gets Claire's present (black) and Claire gets Eve's present (yellow).
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap gifts, so Dave gets Alice's present (green) and Alice gets Dave's present (orange).
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap gifts, so Eve gets Bob's present (white) and Bob gets Eve's present (yellow).

So, the final gift Alice has is the white present. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Dave starts with Patrick. Then, Bob and Claire switch partners.  Eve and Dave switch partners.  Then, Bob and Dave switch partners again.  Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. 

The last step is important because it tells us who Dave is dancing with at the end. 



The answer is **(D) Helga**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a game of book tag! 

* **Alice starts with The Pearl.**
* **Dave and Claire swap books.**  
* **Alice and Bob swap books.**
* **Dave and Claire swap books again.**
* **Eve and Alice swap books.**

This means that the books are being traded back and forth.  

**The answer is (E) Catch-22.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:**  We know everyone has a ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets a green ball and Claire gets a brown ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets a red ball and Eve gets a white ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice gets a red ball and Eve gets a blue ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets a green ball and Claire gets a white ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets a white ball and Dave gets a brown ball.

So, Dave ends up with the brown ball! 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is right midfielder, Bob is benchwarmer, Claire is goalkeeper, Dave is left winger, and Eve is center midfielder.

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes left midfielder, Alice becomes center midfielder.

* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes right midfielder, Alice becomes left winger.

* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes center midfielder, Eve becomes right midfielder.

* **Dave and Claire trade:** Dave becomes goalkeeper, Claire becomes left winger.

* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes goalkeeper, Claire becomes left winger.

So, Bob is now playing goalkeeper! 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions. 

* **Start:** Alice is striker, Bob is midfielder, Claire is fullback, Dave is right winger, and Eve is left midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Eve becomes striker, Alice becomes left midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire becomes right winger, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve becomes left midfielder, Bob becomes right winger.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes left midfielder, Dave becomes right winger.
* **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve becomes right winger, Dave becomes left midfielder.

So, Eve is now playing right winger! 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the positions. 

* **Start:** Alice is the goalie, Bob is the left midfielder, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the striker, and Eve is the center midfielder.

* **Alice and Claire switch:**  Alice becomes the right winger, and Claire becomes the goalie.

* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice becomes the left midfielder, and Bob becomes the goalie.

* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the striker.

* **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the right winger.

* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing the **center midfielder**. 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a pink ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with an orange ball, and Bob starts with a brown ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with an orange ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a pink ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.

So, at the end, Dave has the orange ball. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end:

* **Alice:**  She starts with ""Lolita"".
* **Bob:** He starts with ""The Great Gatsby"".
* **Claire:** She starts with ""Ulysses"".
* **Dave:** He starts with ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
* **Eve:** She starts with ""The Odyssey"".

Now, let's see how they trade:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  They switch books.  So Bob gets ""Lolita"" and Alice gets ""The Great Gatsby"".
* **Eve and Claire swap:** They switch books. So Eve gets ""Ulysses"" and Claire gets ""The Odyssey"".
* **Alice and Bob swap:** They switch books again. So Alice gets ""The Great Gatsby"" and Bob gets ""Lolita"".
* **Dave and Eve swap:** They switch books. So Dave gets ""The Odyssey"" and Eve gets ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".
* **Claire and Eve swap:** They switch books. So Claire gets ""The Odyssey"" and Eve gets ""Ulysses"".

**So, at the end, Dave has ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".**

"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Dave and Alice:**  Dave gives Alice his pink ball, and Alice gives Dave her brown ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her brown ball, and Claire gives Alice her orange ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob her orange ball, and Bob gives Claire her blue ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gives Bob his blue ball, and Bob gives Eve her blue ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice gives Dave his brown ball, and Dave gives Alice her pink ball.

So, Eve ends up with the blue ball. 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Ophelia.
* Then, Claire and Dave switch partners, so Claire is now with Rodrigo.
* Then, Eve and Alice switch partners, so Eve is now with Dave.

So, Dave is now dancing with Melissa! 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

1. **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice goes from striker to fullback, and Bob goes from fullback to striker.
2. **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave goes from striker to fullback, and Bob stays as striker.
3. **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice goes from striker to left midfielder, and Eve goes from benchwarmer to striker.
4. **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave goes from left midfielder to right midfielder, and Claire goes from right midfielder to left midfielder.
5. **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice goes from right midfielder to striker, and Eve goes from striker to left midfielder.

So, Eve ends up playing left midfielder! 


**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:** Alice has pink, Bob has yellow, Claire has green, Dave has brown, and Eve has orange.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Eve's present goes to Bob, and Bob's present goes to Eve.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's present goes to Alice, and Alice's present goes to Eve.

So, the final gift Alice has is the orange ball. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Alice and Claire:**  They swap colors, so Alice gets blue and Claire gets red.
* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap colors, so Bob gets red and Alice gets white.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap colors, so Eve gets red and Alice gets pink.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap colors, so Claire gets brown and Dave gets blue.

So, Dave ends up with the blue present! 


The answer is **(B) blue present**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Bob switch partners, so Eve is now with Jamie. Then Dave and Alice switch partners, so Dave is now with Alice.  Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Karl. Then Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Bob. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Dave. 

So, Dave is dancing with **Alice** at the end.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  Alice is the striker, Bob is the fullback, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the center midfielder, and Eve is the benchwarmer.

* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire moves to fullback, and Bob moves to left winger.

* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave moves to left winger, and Claire moves to center midfielder.

* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice moves to fullback, and Bob moves to striker.

* **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve moves to center midfielder, and Dave moves to benchwarmer.

* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice moves to center midfielder, and Dave moves to striker.

**So, Bob is now the striker!** 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Alice starts with ""The Pearl"".  Then, Bob and Dave trade books.  Bob gets Ulysses from Dave, and Dave gets Frankenstein from Bob.  

Then, Bob and Claire swap books, and Dave and Claire swap books.  

Finally, Claire and Bob swap books again.  Alice and Eve swap books.

So, who has Frankenstein at the end? 


**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone is swapping gifts.  Let's see who gets what:

* **Claire and Alice:**  They swap, so Claire gets Alice's present and Alice gets Claire's present.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap again, so Bob gets Claire's present and Claire gets Bob's present.
* **Dave and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Dave's present and Dave gets Alice's present.
* **Eve and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Eve's present and Eve gets Dave's present.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap again, so Bob gets Alice's present and Alice gets Bob's present.

Now, let's look at the final gift.  Bob has the green present! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob starts with an orange ball, Eve starts with a brown ball. They swap, so Eve now has an orange ball and Bob has a brown ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve now has an orange ball, Dave now has a brown ball.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave now has a brown ball, Alice now has a green ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has a green ball, Claire now has a brown ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has a brown ball, Claire now has a green ball.

So, Dave ends up with the green ball! 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

1. **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Dave becomes the right winger.
2. **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the striker.
3. **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire becomes the goalkeeper, and Dave becomes the left winger.
4. **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.
5. **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Eve is playing the right winger. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Eve switch partners, then Alice and Claire switch partners, and then Dave and Bob switch partners.  

Finally, Alice and Eve switch partners again.  

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 



**Answer:** (C) Melissa 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Eve starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.  She and Claire swap books, so Claire gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Eve gets *The Pearl*. 

Then Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets *Hound of the Baskervilles* and Eve gets *Catch-22*.

Claire and Dave swap, so Claire gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Dave gets *The Pearl*.

Then Bob and Eve swap again, so Bob gets *The Pearl* and Eve gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

Finally, Alice and Bob swap, so Alice gets *Catch-22* and Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*.

So, Eve ends up with *The Fellowship of the Ring*. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Eve and Claire start:** They swap gifts, but we don't know what they swap.
2. **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire's gift is now Bob's.
3. **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob's gift is now Alice's.
4. **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve's gift is now Alice's.
5. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob's gift is now Dave's.

So, the last gift Bob has is the one that was in the last swap, which is the green present. 


**Answer: (E) green present.** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they trade books throughout the semester. 

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gives Claire her book, and Claire gets it.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gives Eve her book, and Eve gets it.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gives Claire his book, and Claire gets it.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gives Bob his book, and Bob gets it.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gives Alice his book, and Alice gets it.

So, Eve got the book that was passed around the most.  

**The answer is (B) Ulysses.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Bob switched partners, and then Claire and Dave switched partners.  That means Claire is now dancing with someone other than Dave.  Then Eve and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Claire and Eve switched partners. 

So, Claire is now dancing with someone other than Eve.  

The answer is **(A) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they traded gifts. We don't know who got what.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  They also traded gifts. We don't know who got what.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  They traded gifts. We don't know who got what.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  They traded gifts. We don't know who got what.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  They traded gifts. We don't know who got what.

So, we can't figure out who has what at the end. 


**The answer is none of the above.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Alice switch partners, then Eve and Alice switch partners.  Then Bob and Dave switch partners, and then Bob and Eve switch partners again.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners.  

This means Eve is dancing with Helga at the end. 


The answer is **(D)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Eve and Bob traded balls first, so Eve got Bob's blue ball and Bob got Eve's green ball.  Then Dave and Claire swapped, so Dave got Claire's brown ball and Claire got Dave's red ball.  

Next, Alice and Eve swapped, so Alice got Eve's blue ball and Eve got Alice's yellow ball.  Then Alice and Dave swapped, so Alice got Dave's red ball and Dave got Alice's yellow ball.  Finally, Bob and Alice swapped, so Bob got Alice's blue ball and Alice got Bob's yellow ball.

So, who has the blue ball at the end? 


**Answer: (E) blue ball** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Alice switch partners, then Claire and Dave switch partners, and then Alice and Dave switch partners again.  This means that Dave and Alice are now dancing with different people. 

Then, Bob and Eve switch partners.  

Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners. 

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end? 



**Answer:** (D) Sam 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Bob switch partners, then Dave and Claire switch partners.  Then, Claire and Bob switch partners again.  Then, Dave and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Claire and Eve switch partners.  

Eve ends up with Rodrigo. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This changes the colors again.

So, the final gift Bob has is the one that was in the gift that Bob and Eve swapped. 

The answer is **(A) red present.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap, so Dave gets the white present and Alice gets the purple present.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets the yellow present and Claire gets the purple present.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets the purple present and Dave gets the pink present.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets the green present and Bob gets the purple present.
* **Dave and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets the purple present and Dave gets the yellow present.

So, Claire ends up with the purple present! 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire starts with a brown ball, and Alice starts with a black ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Dave starts with a green ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave starts with a green ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob starts with a purple ball, and Alice starts with a brown ball.

So, Bob has the brown ball! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means they each get a new ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means they each get a new ball.

So, at the end of the game, everyone gets a new ball.  

**The answer is (E) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the swaps:

* **First:**  Bob and Claire swap.  
* **Second:** Dave and Bob swap.
* **Third:** Claire and Bob swap.
* **Fourth:** Bob and Alice swap.
* **Fifth:** Eve and Bob swap.

Notice that Bob is the one who gets to swap with everyone else.  So, at the end, Bob will have the ball that he started with.  

The answer is **(B) green ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Alice gets The Fellowship of the Ring.**
* **Bob gets The Odyssey.**
* **Claire gets Catch-22.**
* **Dave gets The Great Gatsby.**
* **Eve gets Lolita.**

Now, let's see how the books get traded around.

* **Alice and Eve swap books.**  This means they both have a book they're not interested in anymore.
* **Claire and Eve swap books.** This means Claire's book is now Eve's.
* **Alice and Eve swap books.** This means Alice's book is now Eve's.
* **Eve and Dave swap books.** This means Eve's book is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Bob swap books.** This means Bob's book is now Alice's.

So, Eve ends up with The Great Gatsby. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Eve switch partners, then Alice and Claire switch partners, and so on.  Let's see who Eve ends up with at the end. 

* **Dave and Eve switch:** This changes Eve's partner to Dave.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** This changes Claire's partner to Alice.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** This changes Bob's partner to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** This changes Eve's partner to Alice.
* **Eve and Dave switch:** This changes Dave's partner to Eve.

So, Eve is dancing with Dave at the end. 


The answer is **(B) Helga.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Alice and Dave:**  They swap their balls, so Dave gets Alice's orange ball and Alice gets Dave's white ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap their balls, so Claire gets Bob's black ball and Bob gets Claire's pink ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap their balls, so Dave gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Dave's pink ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap their balls, so Dave gets Bob's pink ball and Bob gets Dave's orange ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap their balls, so Dave gets Alice's orange ball and Eve gets Dave's white ball.

So, Dave ends up with the orange ball! 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, and Eve all start with a partner.
* They switch partners a few times during the dance.

Let's look at the moves:

1. Alice and Claire switch partners.
2. Alice and Bob switch partners.
3. Alice and Dave switch partners.
4. Claire and Eve switch partners.
5. Eve and Bob switch partners.

**The final answer is (B) Rodrigo.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps:

1. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Bob gets a pink ball and Dave gets a white ball.
2. **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice gets a white ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
3. **Eve and Bob swap:**  Eve gets a pink ball and Bob gets a red ball.
4. **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets a red ball and Claire gets a pink ball.
5. **Claire and Eve swap:**  Claire gets a pink ball and Eve gets a red ball.

So, Eve ends up with the red ball! 


The answer is **(A)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:** Alice has brown, Bob has white, Claire has black, Dave has red, and Eve has purple.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This changes things!
* **Bob and Claire swap again:**  This changes things again!
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This changes things again!
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This changes things one last time!

So, the final gift Alice has is the purple present. 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Eve and Alice** swap, so Eve gets the purple present and Alice gets the orange ball.
* **Bob and Dave** swap, so Bob gets the blue present and Dave gets the brown present.
* **Bob and Alice** swap, so Bob gets the purple present and Alice gets the blue present.
* **Claire and Eve** swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.
* **Alice and Eve** swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.

So, Claire ends up with the purple present! 


**The answer is (B).**

* **Start:**  Alice is in the middle, Bob is on the outside, Claire is the goalie, Dave is on the left, and Eve is on the right.

* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve goes to the left, and Claire goes to the right.

* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice moves to the left, and Dave moves to the middle.

* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire moves to the right, and Bob moves to the middle.

* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve moves to the middle, and Alice moves to the right.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire moves to the right, and Eve moves to the middle.

**So, Bob is now playing right winger!** 


The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Dave and Bob switch places.
2. Claire and Dave switch places.
3. Alice and Claire switch places.
4. Claire and Dave switch places again.
5. Eve and Alice switch places.

Notice that Dave is always switching positions with someone else.  The final position Dave ends up in is left midfielder. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Eve and Bob traded balls first, so Bob got the green ball. Then Dave and Claire traded, and Claire got the red ball.  

Next, Alice and Eve traded, and Alice got the red ball.  Then Alice and Dave traded, and Dave got the green ball. Finally, Bob and Alice traded, and Bob got the red ball. 

So the answer is **(A) red ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Claire starts with a black ball, and Dave starts with a white ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Claire starts with a black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a yellow ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave starts with a black ball, and Bob starts with a pink ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice starts with a yellow ball, and Bob starts with a black ball.

So, Dave ends up with the black ball. 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Bob and Alice switch places.
2. Claire and Fred switch places.
3. Gertrude and Fred switch places.
4. Eve and Fred switch places.
5. Alice and Gertrude switch places.
6. Gertrude and Dave switch places.
7. Bob and Dave switch places.

Now, let's see where Dave ends up:

* **Dave starts as center midfielder.**
* **Bob becomes goalkeeper.**
* **Alice becomes right midfielder.**
* **Claire becomes right winger.**
* **Eve becomes fullback.**
* **Fred becomes striker.**
* **Gertrude becomes center midfielder.**

So, Dave is now playing **center midfielder**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

It sounds like they're trading books all semester.  Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Start with the initial books:**  We know who got what at the beginning.
* **Look at the swaps:**  They swap books a bunch of times.  Let's see who swaps with whom.
* **Think about the end:**  We need to figure out who has the book at the end.

Let me know if you want to try to figure it out together! 


"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that Eve ends up with the ball that was originally held by Fred.  Think about it like this:

* **Bob and Gertrude:**  They swap balls, so we know the ball that Bob had is now with Gertrude.
* **Dave and Bob:**  Dave gets Bob's ball, so we know that Bob's ball is now with Dave.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gets Gertrude's ball, so we know that Gertrude's ball is now with Eve.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his ball to Alice, so we know that Alice's ball is now with Bob.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve gets Fred's ball, so we know that Fred's ball is now with Eve.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire gets Dave's ball, so we know that Dave's ball is now with Claire.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Gertrude gets Fred's ball, so we know that Fred's ball is now with Gertrude.

So, Eve ends up with the ball that was originally held by Fred. 

**The answer is (A) red ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade them with each other.  Let's see who gets which ball after all the trades.

* **Claire and Dave:**  They swap their balls.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap their balls.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap their balls.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap their balls.
* **Eve and Gertrude:** They swap their balls.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap their balls.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap their balls.

So, who ends up with the ball?  

**The answer is (A) white ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Eve swapped gifts, and then Bob and Gertrude swapped gifts.  Then Alice and Claire swapped gifts.  We can keep going through the swaps to see what Fred ends up with. 

Fred and Eve swapped, so Fred got Eve's red present.  Then Bob and Gertrude swapped, so Bob got Gertrude's pink ball.  Alice and Claire swapped, so Alice got Claire's black ball.  Then Dave and Fred swapped, so Dave got Fred's brown present.  Then Alice and Fred swapped, so Alice got Fred's brown present.  Finally, Dave and Eve swapped, so Dave got Eve's red present.  

So, Fred got Alice's green present. 



**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Gertrude switch partners. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners.  Then, Dave and Alice switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners. Then, Dave and Gertrude switch partners. Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners. 

So, we know that Gertrude is dancing with Rodrigo at the end. 


The answer is **(B) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out what book Eve has!

We know that everyone starts with a new book. Then, they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets which book as they trade:

* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets *Catch-22*, Claire gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Gertrude gets *The Odyssey*.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*, Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*, Claire gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gets *Frankenstein*, Alice gets *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* **Bob and Eve:** Bob gets *The Great Gatsby*, Eve gets *Ulysses*.

So, Eve ends up with *Ulysses*. 

**Answer:** (D) 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  Claire gets Frankenstein, Eve gets Ulysses.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Fred gets The Odyssey.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets Ulysses, Eve gets Frankenstein.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, Dave gets Ulysses.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Ulysses, Claire gets The Odyssey.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets Moby Dick, Gertrude gets Ulysses.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles.

So, at the end, Dave has Ulysses. 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the game is about trading balls.  Here's what we can figure out:

1. **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  This means Claire gets the orange ball and Gertrude gets the pink ball.
2. **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve gets the orange ball and Alice gets the pink ball.
3. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets the orange ball and Gertrude gets the pink ball.
4. **Alice and Dave swap:** This means Alice gets the orange ball and Dave gets the black ball.
5. **Fred and Dave swap:** This means Fred gets the orange ball and Dave gets the black ball.
6. **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire gets the black ball and Dave gets the orange ball.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob gets the orange ball and Eve gets the black ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the black ball. 

**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets Alice's green present, and Alice gets Bob's white present.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire gets Dave's red present, and Dave gets Claire's purple present.
3. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's orange present, and Gertrude gets Bob's white present.
4. **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets Bob's white present, and Bob gets Fred's yellow present.
5. **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets Eve's blue present, and Eve gets Claire's purple present.
6. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's green present, and Bob gets Alice's white present.

Now, let's look at the final gift.  Eve got Claire's purple present, and Claire got Dave's red present.  So, Eve has the **green** present. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what Fred has at the end.  Let's look at the swaps:

* Eve and Dave swap gifts.
* Alice and Bob swap gifts.
* Alice and Claire swap gifts.
* Fred and Claire swap gifts.
* Gertrude and Dave swap gifts.
* Bob and Dave swap gifts.
* Alice and Bob swap gifts.

It looks like the colors are getting mixed up.  We don't know what they swapped, but we know the colors are now mixed up. 

**So the answer is (D) the black ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Eve and Bob swap:**  This means Eve's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Eve's.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Alice's.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:**  This means Alice's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Claire's.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This means Dave's present is now Fred's, and Fred's present is now Dave's.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  This means Bob's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Bob's.

Now, we need to figure out what Dave has.  

**The answer is (F) green present.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that Claire and Alice swap balls a few times.  That means Claire starts with an orange ball.  

So the answer is (E). 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Claire is a right winger.
* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes a fullback, Fred becomes a goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes a left midfielder, Claire becomes a right winger.
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes a center midfielder, Fred becomes a left midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes a right winger, Alice becomes a benchwarmer.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes a right winger, Alice becomes a goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes a center midfielder, Dave becomes a goalkeeper.

**Final Positions:**

* **Claire:**  Since Bob and Claire traded positions, Claire is now a right winger. 


**Answer:** (C) 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone gets a new book at the start. Then, they trade books with each other.  

* Bob and Gertrude swap books, but that doesn't change who has which book.
* Eve and Dave swap books, so Eve now has Dave's book.
* Alice and Gertrude swap books, so Alice now has Gertrude's book.
* Eve and Alice swap books, so Eve now has Alice's book.
* Fred and Eve swap books, so Fred now has Eve's book.
* Alice and Bob swap books, so Alice now has Bob's book.
* Claire and Alice swap books, so Claire now has Alice's book.

Now, we need to figure out who has Eve's book at the end.  Eve has traded books with everyone else, so she must have the book she traded with Fred. 

**The answer is (B) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Alice** starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* **Bob** gets *Lolita*.
* **Claire** gets *Ulysses*.
* **Dave** gets *Frankenstein*.
* **Eve** gets *Moby Dick*.
* **Fred** gets *Catch-22*.
* **Gertrude** gets *The Pearl*.

Now, let's see how they trade books.  They swap books with each other.  

* Alice and Eve swap books.
* Bob and Alice swap books.
* Dave and Eve swap books.
* Alice and Fred swap books.
* Gertrude and Eve swap books.
* Gertrude and Fred swap books.
* Fred and Claire swap books.

So, who ends up with *Moby Dick*?  It's Eve! 


**Answer: (D) Moby Dick** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's see who ends up with who:

1. **Dave and Gertrude switch partners:**  Dave-Izzi, Gertrude-Bob
2. **Gertrude and Bob switch partners:**  Dave-Izzi, Fred-Bob
3. **Dave and Eve switch partners:**  Fred-Bob, Eve-Alice
4. **Fred and Bob switch partners:**  Eve-Alice,  

So, we know that Alice is dancing with someone new.  

**The answer is (G) Jamie.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:**  Dave has a brown present, Claire has an orange ball, Alice has a red present, Bob has a white present, Eve has a black ball, Fred has a pink ball, and Gertrude has a yellow present.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave gets an orange present, Claire gets a brown present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets a white present, Bob gets a red present.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Gertrude gets a pink present, Fred gets a yellow present.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets a black present, Eve gets a brown present.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets a yellow present, Gertrude gets a pink present.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets a black present, Eve gets a pink present.

**Final State:** Dave has the yellow present. 


So the answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as fullback.**
* **Eve and Bob switch positions.**
* **Gertrude and Bob switch positions.**
* **Bob and Dave switch positions.**
* **Gertrude and Dave switch positions.**
* **Bob and Claire switch positions.**
* **Fred and Bob switch positions.**
* **Alice and Eve switch positions.**

Let's look at the final positions:

* **Alice is now playing left winger.** 


So the answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Everyone has a different color gift.
2. **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice's white gift is now Eve's pink gift.
3. **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve's pink gift is now Fred's orange gift.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice's white gift is now Bob's yellow gift.
5. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's red gift is now Dave's black ball.
6. **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's pink gift is now Claire's red gift.
7. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob's yellow gift is now Gertrude's purple gift.
8. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's orange gift is now Alice's white gift.

So, Eve ends up with Alice's white gift! 

**Answer:** (F) white present. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Bob started as a benchwarmer.  Then, he traded positions with Eve, Fred, and Claire.  

* Eve and Bob switched places.
* Fred and Claire switched places.
* Bob and Fred switched places again.
* Bob and Claire switched places again.
* Eve and Alice switched places.
* Dave and Gertrude switched places.
* Claire and Gertrude switched places.

So, Bob ended up as a Left Winger! 


**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  Let's see who gets what ball after all the trades:

* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a white ball, Gertrude gets a brown ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets a yellow ball, Claire gets a pink ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gets a yellow ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets a pink ball, Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets a pink ball, Claire gets a green ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets a green ball, Claire gets a brown ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets a brown ball, Claire gets an orange ball.

So, Eve ends up with the orange ball! 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. **Gertrude and Bob switch places:**  Gertrude becomes the fullback, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.
2. **Eve and Alice switch places:** Eve becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the striker.
3. **Gertrude and Dave switch places:** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
4. **Dave and Fred switch places:** Dave becomes the cheerleader, and Fred becomes the left midfielder.
5. **Claire and Eve switch places:** Claire becomes the striker, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.
6. **Fred and Gertrude switch places:** Fred becomes the center midfielder, and Gertrude becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Gertrude is playing striker! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're swapping them!  Let's see who ends up with what.

Here's how it works:

1. **Gertrude and Alice:** They swap balls.
2. **Eve and Claire:** They swap balls.
3. **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap balls.
4. **Bob and Alice:** They swap balls.
5. **Eve and Alice:** They swap balls.
6. **Dave and Alice:** They swap balls.
7. **Dave and Fred:** They swap balls.

Now, the important part is to think about who got the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with them. 

**So, who has the ball that was originally held by Alice?**

* **(A) black ball**
* **(B) blue ball**
* **(C) orange ball**
* **(D) pink ball**
* **(E) yellow ball**
* **(F) purple ball**
* **(G) green ball**


 
Let me know if you want to try another one! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners.  Here's what we know:

* **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:**  This means they switch places.
* **Eve and Alice switch partners:**  This means they switch places.
* **Fred and Bob switch partners:** This means they switch places.
* **Dave and Alice switch partners:** This means they switch places.
* **Alice and Claire switch partners:** This means they switch places.
* **Dave and Bob switch partners:** This means they switch places.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:** This means they switch places.

So, Fred is now dancing with Izzi. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners.  Here's what we know:

* **Dave and Eve switch partners:**  This means they swap places.

**Answer: (B) Ophelia** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone is swapping gifts.  Let's look at the swaps and see what we can figure out. 

* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's present is now Eve's present, and Eve's present is now Bob's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's present is now Gertrude's present, and Gertrude's present is now Claire's.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude's present is now Dave's present, and Dave's present is now Gertrude's.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** This means Eve's present is now Fred's present, and Fred's present is now Eve's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's present is now Bob's present, and Bob's present is now Fred's.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire's present is now Alice's present, and Alice's present is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's present is now Bob's present, and Bob's present is now Fred's.

So, we can see that the gifts are being swapped around.  

**The answer is (F) black ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Fred started as a left midfielder.  Then, Claire and Fred switched places.  Then, Alice and Fred switched places.  Then, Eve and Alice switched places.  Then, Claire and Fred switched places again.  Then, Dave and Fred switched places.  Finally, Bob and Gertrude switched places. 

So, Fred is still a left midfielder! 


**Answer:** (F) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Claire and Eve switched partners, then Alice and Fred switched partners, and so on.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes Izzi, Eve becomes Dave.
* **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice becomes Rodrigo, Fred becomes Izzi.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude becomes Jamie, Dave becomes Ophelia.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve becomes Rodrigo, Bob becomes Ophelia.
* **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve becomes Jamie, Fred becomes Ophelia.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob becomes Izzi, Claire becomes Jamie.

So, Claire is now dancing with Jamie! 


**Answer: (E)**

"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. **Gertrude and Bob switch places.**  Gertrude moves to the left midfielder spot, and Bob moves to center midfielder.
2. **Bob and Eve switch places.** Bob becomes the benchwarmer, and Eve becomes the left midfielder.
3. **Alice and Eve switch places.** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, and Eve becomes the left midfielder.
4. **Dave and Fred switch places.** Dave becomes the fullback, and Fred becomes the left winger.
5. **Gertrude and Bob switch places again.** Gertrude becomes the fullback, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.
6. **Gertrude and Fred switch places again.** Gertrude becomes the center midfielder, and Fred becomes the fullback.
7. **Gertrude and Claire switch places.** Gertrude becomes the fullback, and Claire becomes the center midfielder.

So, at the end of the game, Gertrude is playing **center midfielder**. 


**The answer is (D).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a ball of a certain color.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob her ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

So, the last person to have a ball is Eve.  She must have the green ball. 


**The answer is (E).**

* **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
* **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
* **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**

Now, we need to figure out who Claire is dancing with at the end.  

**The answer is (C) Jamie.** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

The last person to have a ball is Fred.  So, Fred has the blue ball. 

**Answer:** (E) 
"
"Okay, let's break it down!

Eve and Dave swap balls a few times, so they're probably getting new balls.  Then, Eve and Alice swap, and then Bob and Alice swap.  

The last swap is between Alice and Dave.  

So, the answer is **(E) white ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Alice** gets The Odyssey to start.
* **Bob** gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Claire** gets The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Dave** gets The Pearl.
* **Eve** gets The Great Gatsby.
* **Fred** gets Catch-22.

3. Fred and Dave switch positions.
4. Eve and Gertrude switch positions.
5. Bob and Gertrude switch positions.
6. Alice and Gertrude switch positions.
7. Dave and Eve switch positions.

Now, let's see where Eve ends up:

* Eve starts as a cheerleader.
* Claire and Dave switch positions, so Dave is now a left winger.
* Dave and Gertrude switch positions, so Dave is now a left winger.
* Fred and Dave switch positions, so Fred is now a left winger.
* Eve and Gertrude switch positions, so Eve is now a right winger.
* Bob and Gertrude switch positions, so Bob is now a left winger.
* Alice and Gertrude switch positions, so Alice is now a right winger.
* Dave and Eve switch positions, so Dave is now a right winger.

Eve is now playing right winger! 


The answer is **(D)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Eve and Fred switch partners.** This means Eve is now with Izzi, and Fred is now with Helga.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners.** This means Bob is now with Ophelia, and Claire is now with Izzi.
* **Bob and Dave switch partners.** This means Bob is now with Ophelia, and Dave is now with Helga.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.** This means Gertrude is now with Izzi, and Fred is now with Ophelia.
* **Alice and Fred switch partners.** This means Alice is now with Izzi, and Fred is now with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Eve switch partners.** This means Bob is now with Ophelia, and Eve is now with Izzi.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.** This means Gertrude is now with Izzi, and Dave is now with Ophelia.

So, Fred is now dancing with Ophelia! 


**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Here's what we know after the swaps:

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets red, Eve gets white.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets orange, Gertrude gets pink.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude gets black, Dave gets orange.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets brown, Fred gets red.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets white, Bob gets brown.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire gets yellow, Alice gets pink.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets orange, Bob gets yellow.

So, who has the brown present? 


**Answer: (F)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players are switching positions throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as Left Midfielder**
* **Eve and Fred switch positions** - Eve becomes Fullback, Fred becomes Goalkeeper
* **Bob and Claire switch positions** - Bob becomes Right Winger, Claire becomes Fullback
* **Bob and Fred switch positions** - Bob becomes Center Midfielder, Fred becomes Right Winger
* **Gertrude and Alice switch positions** - Gertrude becomes Left Midfielder, Alice becomes Benchwarmer
* **Eve and Alice switch positions** - Eve becomes Right Winger, Alice becomes Goalkeeper
* **Eve and Dave switch positions** - Eve becomes Center Midfielder, Dave becomes Goalkeeper

**So, Alice ends up as the Goalkeeper!** 


The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Fred starts with *Lolita*.  Then, he trades with Alice, Eve, and Bob.  Let's see what happens:

* **Fred trades with Alice:** Fred gives *Lolita* to Alice, and Alice gets it.
* **Fred trades with Eve:** Fred gives *Ulysses* to Eve, and Eve gets it.
* **Fred trades with Bob:** Fred gives *Hound of the Baskervilles* to Bob, and Bob gets it.
* **Fred trades with Eve:** Fred gives *Ulysses* to Eve, and Eve gets it.
* **Fred trades with Gertrude:** Fred gives *The Pearl* to Gertrude, and Gertrude gets it.
* **Fred trades with Claire:** Fred gives *Hound of the Baskervilles* to Claire, and Claire gets it.
* **Fred trades with Dave:** Fred gives *Moby Dick* to Dave, and Dave gets it.

So, Fred ends up with *The Odyssey*. 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Here's how the swaps go:

1. **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  Bob gets Gertrude's pink, and Gertrude gets Bob's purple.
2. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude gets Dave's orange, and Dave gets Gertrude's pink.
3. **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gets Gertrude's pink, and Gertrude gets Eve's yellow.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets Dave's orange, and Dave gets Bob's purple.
5. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's orange, and Dave gets Claire's white.
6. **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets Alice's blue, and Alice gets Fred's brown.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets Eve's yellow, and Eve gets Bob's purple.

Now, let's look at Dave.  He started with an orange ball.  He got pink from Gertrude, then got white from Claire.  

**So, Dave ends up with the white present!**

Eve starts with a black ball.  Then, Claire and Gertrude swap gifts.  Fred and Gertrude swap gifts, and then Gertrude and Eve swap gifts.  Dave and Eve swap gifts.  Dave and Alice swap gifts, and then Eve and Alice swap gifts.  Finally, Bob and Dave swap gifts. 

So, what color gift does Eve have at the end? 


**Answer: (F) blue present**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets which book at the end.

* **Eve and Bob:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Gertrude's book.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Gertrude's book.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.

So, Claire ends up with the book that was originally owned by someone else.  

The answer is **(A) The Great Gatsby**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve starts with a black ball.  Here's what happens:

1. Fred and Eve swap.  Eve gets Fred's green present, and Fred gets Eve's black ball.
2. Bob and Alice swap. Alice gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
3. Alice and Gertrude swap. Gertrude gets Alice's blue present, and Alice gets Gertrude's purple present.
4. Dave and Bob swap. Bob gets Dave's pink ball, and Dave gets Bob's orange ball.
5. Dave and Alice swap. Alice gets Dave's pink ball, and Dave gets Alice's blue present.
6. Bob and Gertrude swap. Gertrude gets Bob's orange ball, and Bob gets Gertrude's purple present.
7. Claire and Bob swap. Bob gets Claire's brown present, and Claire gets Bob's orange ball.

So, the final gift Eve has is the one she got from Fred, which is the green present. 

**Answer: (E) green present** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Claire swapped balls first, so Eve now has a pink ball. Then, Bob and Eve swapped, so Bob now has a pink ball.  

Then, Claire and Alice swapped, so Claire has a white ball.  

Bob and Alice swapped again, so Bob has a white ball. 

Dave and Eve swapped, so Dave now has a purple ball. 

Fred and Gertrude swapped, so Fred has a green ball. 

Finally, Gertrude and Claire swapped, so Gertrude has a pink ball. 

So, the final answer is **(B) green ball**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  Let's see who ends up with what ball:

* Eve and Dave trade, then Claire and Eve trade, then Dave and Claire trade...  It looks like they're swapping a lot!
* Bob and Fred trade, then Fred and Dave trade.  
* Finally, Eve and Alice trade, and Dave and Gertrude trade.

Now, who has the white ball? 


**Answer:**  Fred has the white ball. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Here's how the swaps work:

* **Fred and Alice:** Fred gets Alice's yellow present, and Alice gets Fred's pink present.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's blue present, and Claire gets Fred's pink present.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gets Bob's brown present, and Bob gets Dave's orange present.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred gets Dave's orange present, and Dave gets Fred's pink present.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets Eve's red present, and Eve gets Gertrude's black present.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets Eve's red present, and Eve gets Fred's pink present.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Bob's brown present, and Bob gets Claire's blue present.

Now, let's look at who has the black ball.  

**The answer is (F) black ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's break down the ball trading!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap, so Eve gets a blue ball and Alice gets a white ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap again, so they each get the other's ball.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap, so Alice gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
* **Fred and Dave:** They swap, so Fred gets a pink ball and Dave gets a black ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap again, so Claire gets a black ball and Dave gets a pink ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so Bob gets a pink ball and Eve gets a black ball.

**So, Bob ends up with the yellow ball!**

"Okay, let's think about this!

Eve starts with Frankenstein.  Then, Claire and Dave swap books, and that doesn't change Eve's book.  Alice and Eve swap books, and then Gertrude and Dave swap books.  Alice and Fred swap books, and then Bob and Claire swap books.  Finally, Alice and Eve swap books again. 

So, Eve ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring. 


**Answer: (F)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Alice and Bob switch partners, and then Dave and Alice switch partners.  So, after all the switching, Alice is dancing with Dave. 

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a ball of a certain color.  Then, they trade with each other.  We need to figure out who ends up with which color ball.

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives up her blue ball to Alice.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives up his green ball to Bob.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives up his green ball to Claire.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives up her brown ball to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Eve.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives up her orange ball to Fred.

So, Fred ends up with the green ball. 


**The answer is (E) green ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the game is about trading balls.  Here's what we can see:

* **Start:** Alice has a black ball, Bob has a green ball, Claire has a white ball, Dave has a red ball, Eve has a brown ball, Fred has a purple ball, and Gertrude has an orange ball.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They trade their balls.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** They trade their balls.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** They trade their balls.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** They trade their balls.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** They trade their balls again.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** They trade their balls.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** They trade their balls.

So, who has the ball at the end?  It's Fred! 


**Answer:** (C) 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Claire switch partners, and then Gertrude and Claire switch partners.  Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.  

So, Dave is now dancing with Melissa. 


The answer is **(C)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone gets a new book at the start. Then, they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets which book at the end:

* **Gertrude and Dave:**  They swap books, so Dave now has Gertrude's book.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap books, so Eve now has Fred's book.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap books, so Bob now has Gertrude's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap books, so Alice now has Claire's book.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap books, so Claire now has Eve's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** They swap books, so Bob now has Eve's book.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap books, so Alice now has Bob's book.

So, Bob ends up with the book that Alice had at the beginning. 

**Answer: (A) The Great Gatsby** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that Fred and Gertrude swapped gifts, and then Fred and Eve swapped gifts.  This means that Fred and Eve got each other's presents.  

Then, Bob and Claire swapped gifts, and Claire and Gertrude swapped gifts.  This means that Bob and Claire got each other's presents.

Finally, Alice and Bob swapped gifts.  

So, we know that Fred, Eve, Bob, and Claire all got each other's presents.  

**The answer is (F) red present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude all got new books at the start of the semester.  They then traded books throughout the semester. 

Here's how we can figure out who has what book at the end:

* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets Moby Dick, Eve gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Alice gets Lolita.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets Ulysses, Eve gets Moby Dick.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Catch-22, Fred gets Ulysses.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** Gertrude gets Moby Dick, Eve gets The Pearl.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Gertrude gets The Pearl, Fred gets Moby Dick.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Catch-22, Claire gets The Pearl.

Now, let's look at the final list of books.  

**Which book does Alice have at the end?**

* (A) Catch-22
* (B) Ulysses
* (C) Lolita
* (D) The Pearl
* (E) Hound of the Baskervilles
* (F) Moby Dick
* (G) Frankenstein


 
The answer is **(C) Lolita**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Alice starts with ""The Great Gatsby"".  Then, people trade books.  Let's see who gets what:

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Dave's book.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:**  This means Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Alice's book.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Claire gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Claire's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  This means Bob gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Bob's book.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.

So, at the end, Alice has Bob's book! 


**Answer:**  (B) Frankenstein 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* Fred and Gertrude swap, so they switch colors.
* Fred and Alice swap, so Alice gets Fred's ball.
* Alice and Claire swap, so Claire gets Alice's ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, so Dave gets Bob's ball.
* Fred and Eve swap, so Eve gets Fred's ball.
* Gertrude and Fred swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's ball.
* Gertrude and Bob swap, so Bob gets Gertrude's ball.

Now, Bob has the ball that Gertrude had! 


**Answer: (G)** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:**  We know Alice has a white present, Bob has a black ball, Claire has a pink ball, Dave has an orange ball, Eve has a purple present, Fred has a yellow present, and Gertrude has a blue present.

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This means Dave gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Dave's present.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This means Bob gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Bob's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Gertrude gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Gertrude's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Dave's present.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Dave gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Dave's present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Claire's present.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Dave gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Dave's present.

**The final gift Gertrude has is the one that was originally Fred's.** 


**So the answer is (F) blue present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Bob swapped balls, and then Fred and Claire swapped balls.  Fred got the orange ball from Bob, and then Fred got the white ball from Claire.  

So, Fred has the black ball. 

**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone is swapping gifts.  Let's see who gets what:

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob's orange ball becomes Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave's red present becomes Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave's red present becomes Fred's yellow present.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice's green present becomes Fred's yellow present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire's pink ball becomes Bob's orange ball.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire's pink ball becomes Eve's black ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire's pink ball becomes Gertrude's blue present.

Now, we need to figure out what Fred has.  Fred swapped with Alice and then with Dave.  We know Eve's present is black.  So, Fred must have the present that was originally Claire's.  

The answer is **(B) pink ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Here's what we know after the swaps:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave's present is now Fred's, and Fred's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Alice's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Alice's.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Bob's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Fred's.

So, we can see that the gifts are being swapped in pairs.  

**The question is asking what Dave has at the end.**  

The only person who has a green present is Dave. 

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the game is about trading balls.  Let's see who gets which ball:

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve starts with a white ball and Gertrude starts with a blue ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Bob has a purple ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob now has a purple ball, and Dave has a pink ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred now has a brown ball, and Claire has a black ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve now has a blue ball, and Gertrude has a white ball.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Alice now has an orange ball, and Fred has a brown ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Dave now has a pink ball, and Eve has a blue ball.

**So, Claire has the black ball!**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as the benchwarmer.**
* **Bob starts as the right winger.**
* **Dave is the cheerleader.**
* **Eve is the left midfielder.**
* **Fred is the left winger.**
* **Gertrude is the striker.**

Let's see how the positions change:

1. **Bob and Alice switch places.**  Bob becomes the benchwarmer, and Alice becomes the right winger.
2. **Dave and Eve switch places.** Dave becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the fullback.
3. **Gertrude and Eve switch places.** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, and Eve becomes the striker.
4. **Fred and Bob switch places.** Fred becomes the left winger, and Bob becomes the striker.
5. **Claire and Fred switch places.** Claire becomes the left midfielder, and Fred becomes the left winger.
6. **Gertrude and Alice switch places.** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the striker.
7. **Dave and Fred switch places.** Dave becomes the left winger, and Fred becomes the striker.

**So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing striker!**

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about how the books get traded around. 

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  They trade their books.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They trade their books.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** They trade their books.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** They trade their books again.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** They trade their books.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** They trade their books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** They trade their books.

Now, we need to figure out who has the book that Claire has at the end.  

**The answer is (C) The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing, so let's see what happens:

1. **Gertrude and Bob switch:** Gertrude goes to right winger, Bob goes to right midfielder.
2. **Fred and Claire switch:** Fred becomes striker, Claire becomes center midfielder.
3. **Fred and Dave switch:** Fred becomes fullback, Dave becomes striker.
4. **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve becomes fullback, Dave becomes center midfielder.
5. **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire becomes right winger, Alice becomes striker.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave starts with The Pearl.  Here's how the book swaps go:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles, Gertrude gets The Pearl.
2. **Eve and Claire swap:** Claire gets The Great Gatsby, Eve gets Moby Dick.
3. **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets The Pearl, Gertrude gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
4. **Gertrude and Eve swap:** Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Gertrude gets Moby Dick.
5. **Alice and Eve swap:** Eve gets The Great Gatsby, Alice gets The Pearl.
6. **Bob and Dave swap:** Dave gets Catch-22, Bob gets The Pearl.

So, Dave ends up with **Hound of the Baskervilles**.

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with gifts, and they're swapping them!  Let's see what we can figure out.

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Green
    * Bob: Orange
    * Claire: Black
    * Dave: Blue
    * Eve: Red
    * Fred: Brown
    * Gertrude: Pink

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Fred and Eve now have each other's gifts.

* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Bob and Gertrude now have each other's gifts.

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Claire now have each other's gifts.

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Fred now have each other's gifts.

* **Alice and Fred swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Fred now have each other's gifts.

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Eve now have each other's gifts.

* **Alice and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Eve now have each other's gifts.

**So, the question is: What color gift does Bob have at the end?**

**The answer is (B) orange ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve starts with Melissa.  Then, Claire and Bob switch partners.  Then, Alice and Eve switch partners.  

Let's look at the options:

* **(A) Izzi:**  Izzi is not a partner at the end.
* **(B) Ophelia:**  Ophelia is not a partner at the end.
* **(C) Melissa:**  Melissa is a partner at the end.
* **(D) Sam:**  Sam is a partner at the end.
* **(E) Karl:**  Karl is not a partner at the end.
* **(F) Patrick:**  Patrick is not a partner at the end.
* **(G) Helga:**  Helga is not a partner at the end.

So, the answer is **(D) Sam**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know that Fred starts with a white present.  Here's how the swaps work:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Dave's present.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Dave's present.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Claire gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Claire's present.
4. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Alice's present.
5. **Alice and Gertrude swap:**  This means Gertrude gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Gertrude's present.
6. **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Eve's present.
7. **Fred and Bob swap:**  This means Bob gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Bob's present.

So, Fred ends up with Bob's present! 

**The answer is (F) yellow.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Fred is with Sam, Alice is with Karl, etc.
* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred now has a new partner.
* **Eve and Gertrude switch:** Eve and Gertrude now have a new partner.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire and Eve now have a new partner.
* **Fred and Dave switch:** Fred now has a new partner.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Claire and Alice now have a new partner.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred now has a new partner.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob and Claire now have a new partner.

**So, who is Fred dancing with at the end?**

* **(A) Sam** 
* **(B) Lola**
* **(C) Patrick**
* **(D) Ophelia**
* **(E) Karl**
* **(F) Rodrigo**
* **(G) Melissa** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's see who ends up with who:

1. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** Eve is now with Melissa, and Gertrude is with Rodrigo.
2. **Fred and Dave switch partners:** Dave is now with Ophelia, and Fred is with Melissa.
3. **Alice and Bob switch partners:** Bob is now with Alice, and Alice is with Dave.
4. **Gertrude and Bob switch partners:** Bob is now with Gertrude, and Gertrude is with Alice.
5. **Alice and Claire switch partners:** Claire is now with Bob, and Alice is with Rodrigo.
6. **Dave and Alice switch partners:** Alice is now with Dave, and Dave is with Rodrigo.
7. **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:** Claire is now with Bob, and Gertrude is with Rodrigo.

So, at the end of the dance, Eve is dancing with Rodrigo. 

The answer is **(F)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's see who ends up with who:

1. **Dave and Eve switch partners:**  Dave goes with Melissa, Eve goes with Jamie.
2. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners:** Dave goes with Melissa, Gertrude goes with Karl.
3. **Bob and Gertrude switch partners:** Bob goes with Jamie, Gertrude goes with Karl.
4. **Bob and Fred switch partners:** Bob goes with Melissa, Fred goes with Karl.
5. **Alice and Eve switch partners:** Alice goes with Karl, Eve goes with Melissa.

So, at the end, Bob is dancing with Melissa. 

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a game of musical chairs! 

We start with everyone having a different color gift.  Then, we swap gifts with other people.  

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Alice's gift, and Alice gets Dave's gift.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Same idea, Dave gets Claire's gift, and Claire gets Dave's gift.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  Fred gets Gertrude's gift, and Gertrude gets Fred's gift.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve gets Gertrude's gift, and Gertrude gets Eve's gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets Alice's gift, and Alice gets Eve's gift.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets Bob's gift, and Bob gets Dave's gift.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Gertrude gets Dave's gift, and Dave gets Gertrude's gift.

So, the final gift is the one that Gertrude has.  What color is it? 


**Answer:** (C) black ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players are switching positions throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Fred starts as a Left Winger.**
* **Fred and Eve switch places.**
* **Eve and Claire switch places.**
* **Gertrude and Alice switch places.**
* **Dave and Bob switch places.**
* **Claire and Alice switch places.**
* **Bob and Alice switch places.**
* **Gertrude and Eve switch places.**

So, let's look at the final positions:

* **Fred:**  He started as a Left Winger, and then he switched places with Eve.  
* **Eve:** She started as a Right Midfielder, then switched places with Claire. 
* **Claire:** She started as a Center Midfielder, then switched places with Eve. 
* **Dave:** He started as a Cheerleader, and then switched places with Bob. 
* **Bob:** He started as a Right Winger, and then switched places with Alice. 
* **Alice:** She started as a Striker, and then switched places with Claire. 
* **Gertrude:** She started as a Left Midfielder, and then switched places with Eve. 


**So, Fred is playing Left Winger at the end of the match.** 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets which book after each trade:

* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Bob's book.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Dave's book.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Eve's book.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Alice's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Fred's book.

So, Dave ends up with the book he started with. 

**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about how the books get swapped around. 

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets Lolita, and Gertrude gets Ulysses.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets The Pearl, and Fred gets Moby Dick.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, and Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Ulysses, and Claire gets Frankenstein.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets Frankenstein, and Alice gets The Pearl.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Moby Dick, and Dave gets The Pearl.

Now, the last swap is between Claire and Dave.  Claire gets Moby Dick, and Dave gets The Pearl. 

So, Claire has **The Pearl** at the end. 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice** starts with Sam.
* **Bob** starts with Rodrigo.
* **Dave** starts with Lola.
* **Claire** starts with Jamie.
* **Eve** starts with Helga.
* **Fred** starts with Melissa.
* **Gertrude** starts with Ophelia.

Let's see what happens:

1. **Bob and Dave switch partners.**  This means Bob now dances with Lola, and Dave now dances with Rodrigo.
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.** This means Dave now dances with Helga, and Claire now dances with Rodrigo.
3. **Claire and Eve switch partners.** This means Claire now dances with Melissa, and Eve now dances with Rodrigo.
4. **Alice and Gertrude switch partners.** This means Alice now dances with Rodrigo, and Gertrude now dances with Melissa.
5. **Alice and Bob switch partners.** This means Alice now dances with Helga, and Bob now dances with Melissa.
6. **Bob and Fred switch partners.** This means Bob now dances with Eve, and Fred now dances with Helga.

So, at the end, Alice is dancing with **Helga**. 


**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade them with each other.  

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives her ball to Alice.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives her ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives her ball to Gertrude.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his ball to Alice.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives her ball to Alice.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives his ball to Alice.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives his ball to Fred.

So, who ends up with the ball that was originally held by Eve? 


**Answer:** (B) blue ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Fred starts with *The Great Gatsby*.  Then, Fred and Bob swap books.  Bob and Gertrude swap books.  Fred and Gertrude swap books again.  Alice and Gertrude swap books.  Claire and Gertrude swap books.  Alice and Gertrude swap books again.  Finally, Dave and Eve swap books. 

So, who has the book Fred has at the end?  

**The answer is (D) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as a cheerleader.**
* **Bob starts as a right midfielder.**
* **Claire starts as a right winger.**
* **Dave starts as a center midfielder.**
* **Eve starts as a fullback.**
* **Fred starts as a striker.**
* **Gertrude starts as a goalkeeper.**

Let's see what happens:

1. **Bob and Alice switch positions.** Bob becomes a cheerleader, and Alice becomes a right midfielder.
2. **Claire and Fred switch positions.** Claire becomes a striker, and Fred becomes a right winger.
3. **Gertrude and Fred switch positions.** Gertrude becomes a striker, and Fred becomes a right midfielder.
4. **Eve and Fred switch positions.** Eve becomes a striker, and Fred becomes a fullback.
5. **Alice and Gertrude switch positions.** Alice becomes a fullback, and Gertrude becomes a striker.
6. **Gertrude and Dave switch positions.** Gertrude becomes a center midfielder, and Dave becomes a goalkeeper.
7. **Bob and Dave switch positions.** Bob becomes a goalkeeper, and Dave becomes a center midfielder.

**So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing fullback.** 


**Answer: (D) fullback** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know Alice got The Great Gatsby to start.  Then, she and Bob swap books.  Then, Alice and Claire swap books.  

So, Alice has to have gotten a book from Claire.  

Let me know if you want to try another one! 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade balls with each other.  

* Dave and Fred swap, so Dave gets Fred's ball.
* Claire and Dave swap, so Claire gets Dave's ball.
* Eve and Bob swap, so Eve gets Bob's ball.
* Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's ball.
* Alice and Gertrude swap, so Alice gets Gertrude's ball.
* Bob and Claire swap, so Bob gets Claire's ball.
* Bob and Alice swap, so Bob gets Alice's ball.

Now, we need to figure out who has the ball that was originally Bob's.  

The answer is **(C) blue ball**. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out who has the ball at the end.  Let's look at the trades:

* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gives Fred her blue ball, Fred gets Alice's blue ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, Bob gets Claire's black ball.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gives Alice her blue ball, Alice gets Dave's blue ball.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob gives Fred his orange ball, Fred gets Bob's orange ball.

Fred got the ball from Dave in the last trade.  Fred's ball is the only one that Fred got from someone else. 


The answer is **(A) white ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Everyone starts with a new book:**  That means Fred got Ulysses at the beginning.
* **Then, they trade books:**  We need to see how the trades affect Fred's book. 
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This is the last swap. 

So, Fred ends up with the book he got at the beginning. 

**The answer is (F) Ulysses.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade them with each other.  Let's see who gets which ball after each trade:

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives up her blue ball to Alice.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives up his green ball to Bob.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives up his green ball to Claire.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives up her brown ball to Dave.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Eve.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives up her purple ball to Claire.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives up her orange ball to Fred.

Now, let's think about who has the ball after the last trade.  Bob got a green ball from Fred, and Fred got a blue ball from Claire.  So, Bob has the green ball. 



**Answer:** (B) pink ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob started as a cheerleader.  Then, Bob and Claire switched places.  Then, Bob and Fred switched places again.  Then, Gertrude and Alice switched places.  Then, Eve and Alice switched places.  Finally, Eve and Dave switched places. 

So, let's look at the final positions:

* **Bob:**  He started as a cheerleader, then he became a center midfielder. 
* **Claire:** She started as a right winger, then she became a fullback. 
* **Dave:** He started as a fullback, then he became a goalkeeper. 
* **Eve:** She started as a goalkeeper, then she became a right winger. 
* **Fred:** He started as a center midfielder, then he became a right winger. 
* **Gertrude:** She started as a benchwarmer, then she became a left midfielder.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**
2. **Gertrude and Bob switch partners.**
3. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
4. **Eve and Dave switch partners.**
5. **Bob and Gertrude switch partners.**
6. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
7. **Dave and Fred switch partners.**

Now, let's see who Alice is dancing with at the end. 


**Answer:**  Alice is dancing with Claire. 

**So the answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Let's see how the trades work:

* Alice and Fred swap.
* Claire and Eve swap.
* Dave and Gertrude swap.
* Eve and Dave swap.
* Dave and Fred swap.
* Fred and Claire swap.
* Claire and Bob swap.

If we look at the last swap, Claire and Bob swap.  This means that Bob has the orange ball.  

So, the answer is **(F) orange ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, Gertrude is with Karl.  Then, Fred and Bob switch partners.  Then, Alice and Eve switch partners.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners again.  Then, Bob and Gertrude switch partners.  Then, Fred and Alice switch partners.  Then, Fred and Claire switch partners.  Finally, Dave and Bob switch partners. 

Let's see who ends up with Gertrude! 



**Answer:** (C) Patrick 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners.  Here's what we can see:

* **Alice and Claire switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
* **Bob and Fred switch partners:**  They switch partners.
* **Claire and Dave switch partners:**  They swap places.
* **Alice and Fred switch partners:**  They swap places.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:**  They swap places.
* **Bob and Eve switch partners:**  They swap places.
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners:**  They swap places.

So, we need to figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end.  Let's look at the options:

* **(A) Lola:**  This is not possible because Alice and Claire switched partners.
* **(B) Jamie:**  This is not possible because Claire and Dave switched partners.
* **(C) Karl:**  This is not possible because Bob and Fred switched partners.
* **(D) Helga:**  This is possible because Eve and Gertrude switched partners.
* **(E) Izzi:**  This is not possible because Claire and Dave switched partners.
* **(F) Sam:**  This is not possible because Bob and Eve switched partners.
* **(G) Rodrigo:**  This is not possible because Bob and Fred switched partners.

**So the answer is (D) Helga.** 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with presents, and they're swapping them!  Here's how we can figure out what Dave has:

* **Start:**  We know Alice has pink, Bob has blue, Claire has orange, Dave has yellow, Eve has white, Fred has brown, and Gertrude has red.

* **Swaps:**  We don't know what everyone swapped, but we know the gifts are changing hands.

* **The Problem:**  We need to figure out what happened in each swap to figure out what Dave has. 

**So, we can't know for sure what Dave has!**

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens:

* **First swap:** Claire and Dave swap.
* **Second swap:** Fred and Eve swap.
* **Third swap:** Bob and Claire swap.
* **Fourth swap:** Eve and Alice swap.
* **Fifth swap:** Eve and Gertrude swap.
* **Sixth swap:** Bob and Dave swap.
* **Seventh swap:** Gertrude and Bob swap.

Now, think about who gets which ball after all these swaps.  

**The answer is (G) pink ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know Alice starts with a pink present.  Then, Fred and Eve swap gifts.  Then, Gertrude and Alice swap gifts.  Then, Alice and Bob swap gifts.  Then, Alice and Dave swap gifts.  Then, Fred and Alice swap gifts.  Then, Eve and Alice swap gifts.  Finally, Fred and Claire swap gifts.

Now, let's think about what Alice has at the end.  

**What color is Alice's present at the end?**

(A) yellow
(B) blue
(C) red
(D) white

"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This changes the colors again.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  This changes the colors again.

The important thing is that the colors are swapped around.  So, Gertrude will end up with the brown present. 

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is a right winger.
* **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Gertrude becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the fullback.
* **Bob and Fred switch:** Bob becomes the fullback, and Fred becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude becomes the right winger, and Fred becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the benchwarmer, and Eve becomes the right winger.

So, Bob is now the fullback! 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the game!

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* **Claire and Bob:**  They swap their balls.
* **Dave and Claire:** They also swap their balls.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** They swap their balls.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap their balls.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap their balls again.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap their balls.
* **Dave and Bob:** They swap their balls again.

So, who ends up with the blue ball? 


**Answer:** (A) 
"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a ball of a certain color.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* **Bob and Alice:**  They swap their balls.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap their balls.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap their balls.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap their balls.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap their balls.
* **Fred and Bob:** They swap their balls.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap their balls.

So, who ends up with the green ball? 


**Answer:** (C) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Alice is the left midfielder, Bob is the cheerleader, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the fullback, Eve is the goalkeeper, Fred is the center midfielder, and Gertrude is the benchwarmer.

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes the fullback, Fred becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob becomes the right winger, Claire becomes the fullback.
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob becomes the center midfielder, Fred becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, Alice becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the right winger, Alice becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes the right winger, Bob becomes the center midfielder.

**So, the final positions are:**

* **Gertrude:** Left Midfielder
* **Alice:** Goalkeeper
* **Bob:** Center Midfielder
* **Claire:** Right Winger
* **Dave:** Fullback
* **Eve:** Center Midfielder
* **Fred:** Right Winger

"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that Fred has a black ball to start.  Then, people swap gifts.  

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.

So, Fred's present stays the same! 


**Answer:** (C) black ball

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone got a new book at the start of the semester. Then, they traded books.  Let's see who got which book at the end!

* **Alice and Bob:** They traded books, so we don't know who got which book.
* **Dave and Bob:** They also traded books, so we don't know who got which book.
* **Alice and Eve:** They traded books, so we don't know who got which book.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** They traded books, so we don't know who got which book.
* **Fred and Dave:** They traded books, so we don't know who got which book.
* **Bob and Fred:** They traded books, so we don't know who got which book.
* **Bob and Claire:** They traded books, so we don't know who got which book.

We need to figure out who got which book at the end.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  Let's see who gets what ball:

* **Bob and Gertrude:**  They swap, so Bob gets a white ball and Gertrude gets a brown ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap, so Fred gets a yellow ball and Claire gets a pink ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap, so Dave gets a pink ball and Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** They swap again, so Bob gets a pink ball and Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap, so Alice gets a pink ball and Claire gets a green ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap, so Gertrude gets a green ball and Claire gets a brown ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap, so Eve gets a brown ball and Claire gets an orange ball.

So, who has the white ball? 


**Answer:** (B) white ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone got a new book at the start of the semester.  Then they trade books throughout the semester.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means they both have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Eve and Alice have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Alice and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Gertrude and Dave have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice and Bob have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Eve and Claire have a book they didn't originally get.
* **Alice and Fred swap:**  This means Alice and Fred have a book they didn't originally get.

Now, we need to figure out who has which book at the end of the semester.

"Okay, let's think about this!

Fred gets Lolita to start.  Then, Bob and Claire swap books.  That doesn't change Fred's book.  Then, Dave and Bob swap books.  That doesn't change Fred's book.  Claire and Fred swap books.  That means Fred now has Claire's book.  Then, Claire and Dave swap books.  That means Fred now has Dave's book.  Fred and Eve swap books.  That means Fred now has Eve's book.  Finally, Alice and Dave swap books.  That means Fred now has Alice's book.  Fred and Gertrude swap books.  That means Fred now has Gertrude's book. 

So, Fred has Catch-22! 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Okay, let's break down the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Alice and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

**So, at the end, Bob has the yellow ball!** 


**Answer: (F) yellow ball** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is the benchwarmer, Bob is the striker, Claire is the right winger, Dave is the center midfielder, Eve is the cheerleader, Fred is the left winger, and Gertrude is the goalkeeper.

* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes the left winger, Alice becomes the cheerleader.
* **Alice and Fred trade:** Alice becomes the left winger, Fred becomes the cheerleader.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes the goalkeeper, Gertrude becomes the left winger.
* **Bob and Eve trade:** Bob becomes the cheerleader, Eve becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the striker, Bob becomes the left winger.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes the striker, Claire becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice becomes the center midfielder, Dave becomes the left winger.

**So, Claire is now the right winger!** 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Alice and Bob switch partners:**  This means Alice is now with someone else.
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners:**  This means Eve is now with someone else.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch partners:** This means Claire is now with someone else.
* **Gertrude and Bob switch partners:** This means Gertrude is now with someone else.
* **Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire is now with someone else.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch partners:** This means Fred is now with someone else.
* **Claire and Dave switch partners:** This means Claire is now with someone else.

So, who is Alice with at the end? 



**Answer: (F) Karl** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is with Melissa.
* **Fred and Eve switch:** Fred now dances with Ophelia, Eve now dances with Karl.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob now dances with Claire, Dave now dances with Ophelia.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve now dances with Karl, Alice now dances with Dave.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob now dances with Ophelia, Claire now dances with Karl.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve now dances with Karl, Alice now dances with Dave.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude now dances with Ophelia, Fred now dances with Karl.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob now dances with Ophelia, Dave now dances with Karl.

So, after all the switching, Claire is dancing with Karl. 


The answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob and Dave switched partners, then Fred and Gertrude switched partners, and then Fred and Bob switched partners again.  Then Eve and Bob switched partners.  Finally, Gertrude and Alice switched partners. 

We need to figure out who Bob is dancing with at the end. 



**Answer:** (C) Lola 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Gertrude switch partners, then Dave and Claire switch partners, and so on.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Fred and Gertrude switch:** Fred now dances with Lola.
* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave now dances with Sam.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave now dances with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob now dances with Ophelia.
* **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice now dances with Rodrigo.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave now dances with Jamie.
* **Eve and Gertrude switch:** Eve now dances with Karl.

So, Fred is dancing with Karl! 


The answer is **(F)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a book.  Then, they trade books with each other.  We need to figure out who has the book at the end.

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice starts with Lolita, Eve starts with Catch-22.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.
* **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with Catch-22, Fred starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** Bob starts with Ulysses, Gertrude starts with The Odyssey.

It looks like they trade books back and forth.  The last swap is between Gertrude and Bob.  So, the answer is The Odyssey. 


**The answer is (F) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with gifts, and they're swapping them!  Let's see what we can figure out.

Here's what we know:

* **Alice:**  She has a green present.
* **Bob:** He has a pink ball.
* **Claire:** She has a yellow present.
* **Dave:** He has an orange ball.
* **Eve:** She has a white present.
* **Fred:** He has a brown present.
* **Gertrude:** She has a blue present.

Now, they're swapping gifts.  We don't know what they swapped, but we can figure out who has what! 

**The question is:**  At the end of the event, who has the yellow present?

**The answer is (C) yellow present.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a game! 

We know everyone starts with a new book. Then, they trade books with each other.  

* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Alice's book.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Dave's book.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:** Gertrude gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Gertrude's book.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Alice's book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.

So, the last swap is between Claire and Fred.  

**The final swap is between Claire and Fred.** 

**The answer is (F) Moby Dick.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade balls with each other.  Let's see who gets which ball:

* Fred and Bob swap.
* Eve and Fred swap.
* Dave and Eve swap.
* Alice and Bob swap.
* Dave and Fred swap.
* Bob and Claire swap.
* Gertrude and Alice swap.

The last step is important!  Alice gets Gertrude's ball, and Gertrude gets Alice's ball.  

So, the answer is **(C) brown ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Dave starts as the goalkeeper.  Then, Bob and Fred switch places.  Then, Bob and Dave switch places again.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switch places.  Then, Bob and Dave switch places again.  Then, Gertrude and Dave switch places.  Finally, Eve and Alice switch places.

So, the last position Dave is in is center midfielder. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

Here's what we need to figure out:

* **Who has what after each swap?**

We need to figure out what happens in each swap to see who ends up with what. 


Let me know if you want to try another example! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, Gertrude is with Lola. Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  Then, Dave and Claire switch partners.  

We can keep going through the dance and see who ends up with Gertrude.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players are switching positions throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Dave starts as right midfielder.**
* **Fred and Gertrude switch positions.**
* **Dave and Gertrude switch positions.**
* **Gertrude and Fred switch positions.**
* **Alice and Bob switch positions.**
* **Claire and Dave switch positions.**
* **Eve and Claire switch positions.**
* **Alice and Gertrude switch positions.**

Let's look at the final positions:

* **Dave:**  He started as right midfielder and then traded with Gertrude, so he ends up as **right winger**. 


**Answer:** (G) 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:**  Alice has a white present, Bob has a yellow present, Claire has a red present, Dave has a black ball, Eve has a pink ball, Fred has an orange ball, and Gertrude has a purple present.

* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets Eve's pink ball.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets Fred's orange ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's yellow present.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Claire's red present.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's purple present.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's white present.

So, Alice ends up with the white present! 

**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Alice and Eve switch partners.**
2. **Dave and Fred switch partners.**
3. **Eve and Claire switch partners.**
4. **Dave and Gertrude switch partners.**
5. **Dave and Bob switch partners.**
6. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
7. **Eve and Gertrude switch partners.**

Now, let's see who Dave ends up with.  

* **Dave is with Izzi at the end.** 


So the answer is (D). 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Bob is with Karl, Claire is with Izzi, Dave is with Jamie, Eve is with Helga, Fred is with Rodrigo, and Gertrude is with Ophelia.
* **Claire and Eve switch:**  Claire is now with Izzi, and Eve is with Helga.
* **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Gertrude.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude is now with Ophelia, and Dave is with Jamie.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve is now with Karl, and Bob is with Helga.
* **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve is now with Rodrigo, and Fred is with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now with Izzi, and Claire is with Helga.

So, Bob is now with Izzi! 


**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade balls with other people.  

* **Bob and Gertrude:** They swap, so they both get the other's ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap, so they both get the other's ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap, so they both get the other's ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** They swap again, so they both get the other's ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap, so they both get the other's ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap again, so they both get the other's ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap, so they both get the other's ball.

So, who ends up with the ball that was originally Claire's? 


**The answer is (D) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Fred is a left winger.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob is now a benchwarmer, Alice is a right winger.
* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave is now a left winger, Eve is a cheerleader.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude is now a left winger, Eve is a striker.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred is now a left winger, Bob is a right winger.
* **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire is now a left winger, Fred is a left midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude is now a left midfielder, Alice is a striker.
* **Dave and Fred trade:** Dave is now a left midfielder, Fred is a left winger.

So, Fred is now a left winger! 

The answer is **(B) left winger**. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.

So, the last person to swap gets the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with them. 

**The answer is (E) red ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Bob is the goalkeeper, Claire is the center midfielder, Dave is the right midfielder, Eve is the fullback, Fred is the left midfielder, and Gertrude is the cheerleader.

* **Gertrude and Eve trade:**  Gertrude moves to the left midfielder spot, and Eve moves to the fullback spot.

* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude moves to the left midfielder spot, and Alice moves to the left winger spot.

* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve moves to the fullback spot, and Claire moves to the center midfielder spot.

* **Fred and Eve trade:** Fred moves to the left midfielder spot, and Eve moves to the fullback spot.

* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire moves to the center midfielder spot, and Gertrude moves to the left midfielder spot.

* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire moves to the center midfielder spot, and Dave moves to the right midfielder spot.

* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred moves to the left midfielder spot, and Bob moves to the goalkeeper spot.

**So, Bob is now the goalkeeper!** 


The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color Gertrude ends up with! 

Let's think about how the gifts are swapped.  

* **Alice and Fred swap:**  This means Fred gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Fred's present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Bob gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Bob's present.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** This means Fred gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Fred's present.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Alice's present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Alice's present.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This means Gertrude gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Gertrude's present.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Alice's present.

So, the colors are being swapped, not the gifts themselves.  

**The answer is (A) white present.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred is with Sam at the start. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners.  

So, Fred is now with someone else.

So, who is Gertrude dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Helga**
* **(B) Lola**
* **(C) Ophelia**
* **(D) Karl**
* **(E) Sam**
* **(F) Rodrigo**
* **(G) Melissa**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change who has which book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

So, Dave ends up with the book that Claire had at the beginning.  The answer is **(G) The Odyssey**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, Gertrude is with Helga. Then, Bob and Dave switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Then, Fred and Bob switch partners again.  

We can see that the dancers are switching partners in a pattern.  Let's look at the last few moves: Eve and Bob switch partners, and then Gertrude and Alice switch partners.  

The last move is Claire and Eve switch partners.  

So, Gertrude is dancing with Jamie at the end. 


**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve starts with Lola. Then, Alice and Fred switch partners.  Gertrude and Eve switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners.  Bob and Alice switch partners. Dave and Fred switch partners. Then, Eve and Alice switch partners. Finally, Eve and Claire switch partners. 

So, Eve ends up with Izzi. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books throughout the semester. 

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Alice** got Ulysses.
* **Bob** got The Great Gatsby.
* **Claire** got The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Dave** got The Pearl.
* **Eve** got Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Fred** got Lolita.
* **Gertrude** got Catch-22.

Now, let's see how they traded books.  They traded books in a round-robin fashion.  

* **Bob and Claire** swapped books.
* **Dave and Bob** swapped books.
* **Claire and Fred** swapped books.
* **Claire and Dave** swapped books.
* **Fred and Eve** swapped books.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave got Catch-22 at the end.  Here's how we know:

* **Dave traded with:** Alice, Claire, Bob, and Eve. 

Let's think about the swaps.  We know that Dave traded with Alice, Claire, Bob, and Eve.  

* **Dave traded with Alice:**  This means Dave had to have gotten a book from Alice.
* **Dave traded with Claire:** This means Dave had to have gotten a book from Claire.
* **Dave traded with Bob:** This means Dave had to have gotten a book from Bob.
* **Dave traded with Eve:** This means Dave had to have gotten a book from Eve.

So, Dave must have gotten Catch-22 from someone.

"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade them with each other.  

* Fred and Gertrude swap.
* Gertrude and Bob swap.
* Fred and Claire swap.
* Claire and Dave swap.
* Claire and Eve swap.
* Alice and Bob swap.
* Claire and Eve swap again.

So, the last person to swap is Claire.  Since Claire swapped with Eve, and Eve swapped with Claire, the ball that Eve had is now Claire's.  

The question asks what Dave has at the end.  The only person who has a ball that was originally Claire's is Dave. 

**The answer is (C) yellow ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Gertrude starts with Patrick. Then, Alice and Eve switch partners.  Then, Dave and Fred switch partners.  Eve and Claire switch partners.  Dave and Gertrude switch partners.  Dave and Bob switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners.  Finally, Eve and Gertrude switch partners. 

Let's look at the final partners:

* **Gertrude is now with Alice.** 


So the answer is **(E) Patrick.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now dancing with Patrick. Then Fred and Gertrude switch partners, so Fred is now dancing with Lola.  Eve and Bob switch partners, so Eve is now dancing with Jamie.  Eve and Alice switch partners, so Eve is now dancing with Izzi.  Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now dancing with Ophelia.  Dave and Eve switch partners, so Dave is now dancing with Izzi.  Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners, so Alice is now dancing with Rodrigo. 

So, Eve is dancing with Izzi. 


The answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to see who ends up with what ball.  

* **Dave and Alice:**  Dave starts with a green ball, Alice starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Alice gets the green ball.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice now has the pink ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the pink ball and Alice gets the black ball.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred now has the pink ball, Dave has the black ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Fred gets the black ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve now has the blue ball, Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Eve gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire now has the white ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the white ball and Claire gets the black ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob now has the orange ball, Gertrude has the yellow ball. They swap, so Gertrude gets the orange ball and Bob gets the yellow ball.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude now has the yellow ball, Alice has the black ball. They swap, so Alice gets the yellow ball and Gertrude gets the black ball.

**So, Claire ends up with the white ball!** 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone gets a new book at the start. Then, they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets which book at the end.

* **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap books, so Gertrude starts with Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve and Bob swap, so Eve now has Bob's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap, so Dave now has Bob's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred and Claire swap, so Claire now has Fred's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** Claire and Alice swap, so Alice now has Claire's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob and Dave swap again, so Bob now has Dave's book.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve and Fred swap, so Fred now has Eve's book.

**So, at the end of the semester, Fred has Eve's book.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone is swapping gifts.  Let's see who gets what:

* **Eve and Fred swap:**  Eve's black ball becomes Fred's pink ball, and Fred's pink ball becomes Eve's black ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's green present becomes Bob's yellow present, and Bob's yellow present becomes Dave's green present.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire's purple present becomes Gertrude's blue present, and Gertrude's blue present becomes Claire's purple present.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred's pink ball becomes Claire's purple present, and Claire's purple present becomes Fred's pink ball.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** Gertrude's blue present becomes Alice's brown present, and Alice's brown present becomes Gertrude's blue present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob's yellow present becomes Claire's purple present, and Claire's purple present becomes Bob's yellow present.

So, Dave's present is the one that didn't change hands. 

**Answer:** (F) green present. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out what book Fred has at the end!

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book at the beginning.
* **Trading:**  They trade books in a specific order. 
* **Fred's Book:** We need to figure out what Fred has at the end.

Let's look at the trades:

1. Alice and Gertrude swap books.
2. Dave and Fred swap books.
3. Alice and Claire swap books.
4. Claire and Bob swap books.
5. Eve and Claire swap books.
6. Fred and Alice swap books.
7. Claire and Dave swap books.

**The Final Swap:** Fred and Alice swap books. Fred gets the book Alice had. 

**Answer:** Fred has **Moby Dick**. 



"
"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Alice and Fred switch places.
2. Claire and Gertrude switch places.
3. Dave and Alice switch places.
4. Bob and Dave switch places.
5. Bob and Eve switch places.
6. Eve and Alice switch places.
7. Gertrude and Dave switch places.

Now, let's see where everyone ends up:

* Alice is now a benchwarmer.
* Bob is a left winger.
* Claire is a fullback.
* Dave is a center midfielder.
* Eve is a striker.
* Fred is a goalkeeper.
* Gertrude is a striker. 


So the answer is (E). 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!  

To figure out what book Claire has, we need to look at the swaps.  

* Fred and Alice swap books.
* Fred and Eve swap books.
* Fred and Dave swap books.
* Claire and Fred swap books.
* Gertrude and Dave swap books.
* Fred and Alice swap books.
* Fred and Bob swap books.

So, Fred and Bob swap books. 

**Answer: (F)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Eve starts as a left winger.**
* **Dave and Eve switch positions.**  
* **Eve and Alice switch positions.**
* **Claire and Gertrude switch positions.**
* **Fred and Dave switch positions.**
* **Bob and Dave switch positions.**
* **Claire and Dave switch positions.**
* **Gertrude and Claire switch positions.**

So, let's look at the final positions:

* **Eve:**  She started as a left winger, then switched with Alice.  She then switched with Dave.  She ends up playing right midfielder. 

**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players are in positions:

* Alice is right winger
* Bob is center midfielder
* Claire is fullback
* Dave is left midfielder
* Eve is left winger
* Fred is goalkeeper
* Gertrude is right midfielder

Now, let's see how the positions change:

1. Alice and Dave switch places.
2. Claire and Bob switch places.
3. Fred and Dave switch places.
4. Eve and Bob switch places.
5. Dave and Gertrude switch places.
6. Alice and Dave switch places again.
7. Claire and Eve switch places.

So, after all the trades, Eve is playing right midfielder! 


The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know Eve and Gertrude swap balls, so Eve gets a black ball and Gertrude gets a blue ball.  Then Fred and Bob swap, and Fred gets an orange ball.  Fred and Claire swap, and Fred gets a white ball.  Eve and Fred swap, and Eve gets a yellow ball.  Fred and Claire swap again, and Fred gets a blue ball.  Finally, Alice and Bob swap, and Alice gets an orange ball.  Dave and Gertrude swap, and Dave gets a pink ball.

The last person to swap is Eve, and she gets a blue ball. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a game! 

We know that everyone got a new book at the start of the semester. Then, they trade books with each other.  

Here's how we can figure out who has which book at the end:

* **Fred and Alice:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Eve starts with Frankenstein.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire starts with Lolita, Fred starts with The Odyssey.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude starts with Moby Dick, Dave starts with The Great Gatsby.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Alice starts with Catch-22.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred starts with The Odyssey, Bob starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The answer is (E) The Odyssey.**

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books throughout the semester.  

To figure out who has which book at the end, we need to look at all the swaps they made.  

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means Fred got Gertrude's book and Gertrude got Fred's book.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Claire got Alice's book and Alice got Claire's book.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave got Bob's book and Bob got Dave's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Dave got Claire's book and Claire got Dave's book.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Eve got Bob's book and Bob got Eve's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Dave got Claire's book and Claire got Dave's book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Alice got Eve's book and Eve got Alice's book.

Now, we need to figure out who has which book at the end.  

**The answer is (E) Catch-22.**

* Gertrude and Eve swap, so Gertrude gets a black ball and Eve gets a white ball.
* Claire and Eve swap, so Claire gets a black ball and Eve gets a white ball.
* Eve and Fred swap, so Eve gets a pink ball and Fred gets a black ball.
* Eve and Claire swap, so Eve gets a pink ball and Claire gets a black ball.
* Dave and Fred swap, so Dave gets a pink ball and Fred gets a black ball.

The last trade is between Dave and Fred.  Fred ends up with the black ball. 


The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have to figure out what color ball Alice ends up with.  Let's look at the swaps:

* **Claire and Bob:**  Claire's red ball is swapped for Bob's black ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave's pink ball is swapped for Claire's red ball.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred's blue ball is swapped for Gertrude's orange ball.

* **Alice and Bob:** Alice's purple ball is swapped for Bob's black ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave's pink ball is swapped for Bob's black ball.

So, the last swap is between Dave and Bob.  

**Answer:** (F) black ball 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade balls with other people.  

* Fred and Alice swap, so Fred gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Fred's ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap, so Claire gets Gertrude's ball and Gertrude gets Claire's ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, so Bob gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Bob's ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Eve gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Eve's ball.
* Claire and Bob swap, so Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Dave's ball.
* Claire and Bob swap, so Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.

So, at the end, Fred has the green ball.

* **Start:**  Alice is the goalie, Bob is the center midfielder, Claire is the benchwarmer, Dave is the left winger, Eve is the striker, Fred is the right midfielder, and Gertrude is the left midfielder.

* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve becomes the left winger, Claire becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire becomes the right midfielder, Dave becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave becomes the striker, Bob becomes the right midfielder.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** Fred becomes the left midfielder, Gertrude becomes the right midfielder.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob becomes the striker, Claire becomes the left midfielder.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave becomes the goalie, Alice becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire becomes the striker, Eve becomes the left winger.

So, Claire is now the **left midfielder**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the players are switching positions throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as striker.**
* **Eve and Fred swap positions.**
* **Claire and Eve swap positions.**
* **Fred and Dave swap positions.**
* **Alice and Claire swap positions.**
* **Gertrude and Dave swap positions.**
* **Bob and Alice swap positions.**
* **Gertrude and Dave swap positions.**

So, let's look at the final positions:

* **Alice:**  She started as striker, then swapped with Bob.  She ends up as the goalkeeper. 

**Answer: (C)**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade balls with other people.  Let's see who gets which ball:

* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets Fred's ball, Fred gets Eve's ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets Claire's ball, Claire gets Dave's ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets Gertrude's ball, Gertrude gets Alice's ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** Gertrude gets Eve's ball, Eve gets Gertrude's ball.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets Fred's ball, Fred gets Eve's ball.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets Alice's ball, Alice gets Fred's ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's ball, Bob gets Alice's ball.

So, the last person to have a ball is Dave.  The only ball that Dave didn't trade is his black ball. 

**The answer is (E) black ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
* **Eve and Alice switch partners.**
* **Fred and Dave switch partners.**
* **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
* **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
* **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
* **Eve and Bob switch partners.**

Now, we need to figure out who is dancing with who at the end.  

**The answer is (A) Ophelia.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as Left Midfielder**
* **Bob starts as Striker**
* **Claire is the benchwarmer**
* **Dave is Center Midfielder**
* **Eve is Cheerleader**
* **Fred is Left Winger**
* **Gertrude is Fullback**

Let's see what happens:

1. **Alice and Dave switch positions.**  Alice becomes Center Midfielder, and Dave becomes Left Midfielder.
2. **Alice and Claire switch positions.** Alice becomes Benchwarmer, and Claire becomes Left Midfielder.
3. **Alice and Dave switch positions again.** Alice becomes Left Winger, and Dave becomes Center Midfielder.
4. **Claire and Fred switch positions.** Claire becomes Left Winger, and Fred becomes Center Midfielder.
5. **Dave and Eve switch positions.** Dave becomes Cheerleader, and Eve becomes Center Midfielder.
6. **Gertrude and Bob switch positions.** Gertrude becomes Striker, and Bob becomes Fullback.

**So, Gertrude is now playing Striker!** 


The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Fred started as the benchwarmer.  Then, some players switched positions.  Here's what we know:

* Eve and Claire switched positions.
* Gertrude and Dave switched positions.
* Bob and Claire switched positions.
* Fred and Dave switched positions.
* Gertrude and Fred switched positions.
* Fred and Claire switched positions.
* Claire and Alice switched positions.

So, let's look at the final positions:

* Fred started as the benchwarmer.
* Fred switched positions with Dave.
* Fred switched positions with Gertrude.
* Fred switched positions with Claire.

Fred ended up as the right winger. 


**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Fred got Frankenstein to start. Then, Fred and Dave swap books.  

After that, Alice and Claire swap books.  

Then, Eve and Dave swap books. 

Bob and Eve swap books. 

Gertrude and Claire swap books. 

Eve and Gertrude swap books. 

Finally, Dave and Bob swap books. 

So, Fred has Dave's book at the end. 



The answer is **(D) Frankenstein**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Claire is the striker.
* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes the striker, Claire becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave becomes the goalkeeper, Gertrude becomes the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the center midfielder, Eve becomes the left winger.
* **Fred and Bob trade:** Fred becomes the cheerleader, Bob becomes the right midfielder.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes the right midfielder, Gertrude becomes the striker.
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes the left midfielder, Dave becomes the right midfielder.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes the striker, Claire becomes the center midfielder.

So, Claire is now the center midfielder! 


**The answer is (F).**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

It looks like they're trading books all semester.  Here's how we can figure out where Alice ends up:

* **Alice starts with ""The Pearl"".**
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob now has ""The Pearl"" and Alice has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has ""The Pearl"" and Bob has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Fred and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Fred has ""The Pearl"".
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  This means Claire now has ""The Pearl"" and Fred has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Dave has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Bob has ""The Pearl"".
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has ""The Pearl"" and Gertrude has ""Hound of the Baskervilles"".

**So, Alice ends up with ""The Great Gatsby"".**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave starts with Patrick. Then, Eve and Dave switch partners.  Then, Fred and Eve switch partners.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Then, Dave and Bob switch partners.  Then, Alice and Claire switch partners.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Dave dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (B) Patrick 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color present.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Fred gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Fred's.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** Gertrude gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Gertrude's.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Eve's.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Dave's.

So, the last person to swap is Dave and Bob.  

**The final gift Gertrude has is the one she received from Alice, which is the white present.**

**Answer: (G) white present** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means they switch books.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  They switch books.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  They switch books.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  They switch books.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  They switch books.

Now, we need to figure out who has the book at the end.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, Gertrude is with Helga. Then, Dave and Gertrude switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners.  

We can keep going through the dance and see who ends up with who. 



 
Let me know if you want to try another one! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob starts with a black ball.  Here's how the swaps work:

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets a white present, Alice gets a black ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets a green present, Fred gets a blue present.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets a purple present, Gertrude gets a white present.

* Eve and Dave trade, then Gertrude and Eve trade.  
* Bob and Fred trade.
* Claire and Fred trade.
* Alice and Claire trade.
* Eve and Fred trade.
* Eve and Dave trade.

The last trade is between Eve and Dave.

* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes right winger, Eve becomes center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob trade:** Claire becomes right winger, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Fred and Alice trade:** Fred becomes center midfielder, Alice becomes right winger.

So, Bob is now playing **center midfielder**! 


**Answer: (F)**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Alice started with ""Lolita"".  Let's see who gets her book at the end. 

* **Eve and Fred swap:**  Eve gets Fred's book, Fred gets Eve's book.

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Gertrude gets Eve's book, Eve gets Gertrude's book.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  Dave gets Fred's book, Fred gets Dave's book.

So, we can see that Alice's book is now with someone else.  

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.**

* **(B) white present:**  This is a possibility, but we don't know if it was swapped.
* **(C) yellow present:**  This is a possibility, but we don't know if it was swapped.

* **(F) purple present:**  This is a possibility, but we don't know if it was swapped.
* **(G) green present:**  This is a possibility, but we don't know if it was swapped.

**So, the answer is (B) white present.**

We know that Claire and Dave swapped balls, so Claire got Dave's purple ball and Dave got Claire's brown ball.  Then Fred and Eve swapped, and Bob and Claire swapped.  

The last swap was between Eve and Gertrude.  

So, the final ball distribution is:

* **Claire:**  She has the brown ball. 


**Answer:** (G) brown ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Claire switched partners, then Fred and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Eve and Bob switched partners.  Then Eve and Alice switched partners.  Then Dave and Bob switched partners.  Then Dave and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Alice and Dave switched partners. 

So, who is Alice dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:**  (A) Rodrigo 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred starts with Lola.  Then, Dave and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Bob switch partners.  Then, Eve and Bob switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Fred switch partners. 

So, Fred is now dancing with Rodrigo! 

The answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a game of musical chairs! 

We start with everyone having a different color present.  Then, people swap gifts with each other.  

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This doesn't change anything, they just switch gifts.
* **Fred and Bob swap:**  Fred's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Fred's.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  This changes the colors.

Now, the last step is to figure out what color Gertrude has.  

**The answer is (E) purple present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
2. **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
5. **Alice and Eve switch partners.**
6. **Alice and Dave switch partners.**
7. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**

Now, we need to figure out who Claire is dancing with at the end.  

**The answer is (B) Jamie.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

Here's what we need to figure out:

* **Who got what after each swap?** 

We need to think about who swapped with whom.  

* **Who swapped with who?** 

Let's look at the swaps and see if we can figure out who has what! 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Alice and Eve:** They swap books.
* **Bob and Alice:** They swap books.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap books.
* **Alice and Fred:** They swap books.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** They swap books.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap books.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap books.

It looks like they trade books back and forth.  The important thing is to see who ends up with the book at the end. 

**The answer is (F) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Claire starts with Patrick.  Then, Fred and Alice switch partners.  Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Claire and Eve switch partners.  Fred and Dave switch partners.  Claire and Alice switch partners.  Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:**  (B) Patrick 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets which book after all the trades.

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change who has which book.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

So, Bob ends up with the book that he traded with Fred and Gertrude. 


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with gifts, and they're swapping them!  Let's think about it step by step:

* **Start:** Alice has a white gift, Bob has an orange ball, Claire has a black ball, Dave has a pink ball, Eve has a purple gift, Fred has a green gift, and Gertrude has a brown gift.

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means they traded gifts. We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  They also swapped gifts. We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They swapped gifts. We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They swapped gifts. We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  They swapped gifts again. We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They swapped gifts again. We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  They swapped gifts. We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

**The question is asking what Gertrude has at the end.**  We don't know what they got, but we know they swapped.

**So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing left winger.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Alice is the benchwarmer, Bob is the cheerleader, Claire is the fullback, Dave is the goalkeeper, Eve is the striker, Fred is the right midfielder, and Gertrude is the left midfielder.

* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude becomes the fullback, and Claire becomes the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice becomes the striker, and Eve becomes the left midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire becomes the right midfielder, and Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve becomes the goalkeeper, and Dave becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire becomes the left midfielder, and Gertrude becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave becomes the left midfielder, and Gertrude becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred becomes the striker, and Eve becomes the left midfielder.

**So, the final positions are:**

* **Bob:**  Bob started as the cheerleader and then became the fullback.
* **Alice:** Alice started as the benchwarmer and then became the striker.
* **Claire:** Claire started as the fullback and then became the right midfielder.
* **Dave:** Dave started as the goalkeeper and then became the striker.
* **Eve:** Eve started as the striker and then became the left midfielder.
* **Fred:** Fred started as the right midfielder and then became the striker.
* **Gertrude:** Gertrude started as the left midfielder and then became the goalkeeper.

"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a ball of a certain color.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* **Alice and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
* **Bob and Dave:** They swap, so Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
* **Alice and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap, so Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** They swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Alice's blue ball and Alice gets Eve's ball.

Fred ends up with the green ball. 

**So the answer is (E).**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
2. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
3. **Claire and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
6. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
7. **Bob and Eve switch partners.**

Now, let's see who is left with Bob at the end. 

**The answer is (D) Ophelia.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, Claire is with Jamie.  Then, Dave and Bob switch partners.  Eve and Claire switch partners.  Then, Alice and Eve switch partners.  Gertrude and Alice switch partners.  Eve and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Gertrude and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (B) Rodrigo 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who ends up with what book.

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they switch books.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  They also switch books.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  They switch books.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  They switch books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:**  They switch books.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  They switch books.

So, who has the book that was originally owned by Alice? 


**Answer:**  (F) Hound of the Baskervilles 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know Alice starts with a green present.  Then, she swaps with Gertrude, and then with Bob.  

So, the only possible answer is (E) the black ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Fred got Frankenstein to start. Then, Fred and Dave swap books, so Dave now has Frankenstein.  Eve and Fred swap, so Eve now has Frankenstein.  Then, Gertrude and Bob swap, so Bob now has Frankenstein.  Alice and Bob swap, so Bob now has The Great Gatsby.  Eve and Bob swap again, so Bob now has The Great Gatsby.  Dave and Alice swap, so Alice now has The Great Gatsby.  Finally, Fred and Claire swap, so Claire now has The Great Gatsby.

So, Fred has The Great Gatsby! 


**The answer is (F).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone got a new book at the start of the semester.  Then they trade books throughout the semester.  

* Eve and Bob trade books.
* Fred and Gertrude trade books.
* Claire and Fred trade books.
* Dave and Eve trade books.
* Gertrude and Claire trade books.
* Alice and Gertrude trade books.
* Claire and Bob trade books.

Let's see who ends up with what book! 

**The answer is (A) Lolita.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a ball of a certain color.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Fred his ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Fred his ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve her ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Alice her ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Claire his ball.

So, after all the trades, who has the ball that was originally Gertrude's? 



**Answer:** (B) purple ball. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Eve starts with Frankenstein.  Then, Fred and Alice trade books.  Then, Gertrude and Eve trade books.  Alice and Eve trade books again.  Then, Dave and Gertrude trade books.  Then, Gertrude and Claire trade books.  Finally, Alice and Claire trade books.  

The last trade is between Dave and Bob.  

So, who has the book that Dave gave to Bob?  That's the book Eve has at the end. 

The answer is **(A) Ulysses**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

It sounds like they're trading books, and we need to figure out who has which book at the end.  

Here's what we know:

* **They all start with a new book:**  So, we know they all have a book they got at the beginning.
* **They trade books:**  They swap books with each other.

To figure out who has which book at the end, we need to see how the swaps happen.  

**Here's the problem:** We don't know the order of the swaps. 

**The answer is:** We can't figure out who has which book at the end. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Bob and Fred switch partners:**  This means Bob is now with Melissa, and Fred is now with Claire.
2. **Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Dave, and Alice is now with Bob.
3. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means Gertrude is now with Dave, and Alice is now with Fred.
4. **Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Sam, and Bob is now with Izzi.
5. **Dave and Fred switch partners:** This means Dave is now with Melissa, and Fred is now with Eve.
6. **Eve and Alice switch partners:** This means Eve is now with Dave, and Alice is now with Sam.

So, Claire is now dancing with Sam! 


The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice has a white present, Bob has an orange ball, Claire has a black ball, Dave has a pink ball, Eve has a purple present, Fred has a green present, and Gertrude has a brown present.

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Fred gets purple and Eve gets green.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Bob gets pink and Dave gets orange.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave gets white and Alice gets pink.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob gets black and Claire gets orange.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This means Fred gets green and Eve gets purple.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave gets brown and Claire gets black.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** This means Fred gets brown and Gertrude gets green.

Now, let's look at the final gift Alice has.  

**What color is Alice's present?**

(A) black
(B) brown
(C) white
(D) green
(E) purple
(F) orange
(G) pink

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone traded books throughout the semester.  Let's see who ends up with what book.

* **Alice** started with *The Odyssey*.
* **Bob** started with *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* **Claire** started with *Moby Dick*.
* **Dave** started with *The Pearl*.
* **Eve** started with *The Great Gatsby*.
* **Fred** started with *Catch-22*.
* **Gertrude** started with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.

Now, let's see who traded with whom:

* **Gertrude and Dave** swapped books.
* **Eve and Claire** swapped books.
* **Dave and Gertrude** swapped books.
* **Gertrude and Eve** swapped books.
* **Alice and Eve** swapped books.
* **Bob and Dave** swapped books.
* **Alice and Fred** swapped books.

Now, let's think about who has the book that was swapped last. 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this gift swap!

* **Start:** We have Alice (pink), Bob (brown), Claire (red), Dave (blue), Eve (white), Fred (orange), and Gertrude (black).

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Dave now has Alice's pink present, and Alice now has Dave's blue present.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Now Dave has Claire's red present, and Claire has Dave's blue present.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  Fred's orange present is now Gertrude's black ball, and Gertrude's black ball is now Fred's orange ball.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve's white present is now Gertrude's black ball, and Gertrude's black ball is now Eve's white present.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's white present is now Alice's pink present, and Alice's pink present is now Eve's white present.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave's blue present is now Bob's brown present, and Bob's brown present is now Dave's blue present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Gertrude's black ball is now Dave's blue present, and Dave's blue present is now Gertrude's black ball.

**So, after all the swaps, who has the black ball?**

**Answer:**  Gertrude 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players are switching positions.  Here's what we know:

* Alice starts as a left winger.
* Bob starts as a fullback.
* Claire is a center midfielder.
* Dave is a right winger.
* Eve is a benchwarmer.
* Fred is a cheerleader.
* Gertrude is a left midfielder.

Let's see what happens when they swap positions:

1. Alice and Bob switch places.
2. Dave and Eve switch places.
3. Fred and Bob switch places.
4. Alice and Eve switch places.
5. Claire and Fred switch places.
6. Claire and Bob switch places.
7. Bob and Gertrude switch places.

Now, let's look at the final positions:

* **Gertrude** is now the fullback. 


So the answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as center midfielder.**
* **Bob starts as striker.**
* **Claire starts as left winger.**
* **Dave is the cheerleader.**
* **Eve is the fullback.**
* **Fred is the right winger.**
* **Gertrude is the benchwarmer.**

Let's see what happens:

1. **Alice and Claire switch positions.**  Alice becomes left winger, and Claire becomes center midfielder.
2. **Gertrude and Bob switch positions.** Gertrude becomes striker, and Bob becomes fullback.
3. **Eve and Alice switch positions.** Eve becomes center midfielder, and Alice becomes fullback.
4. **Claire and Fred switch positions.** Claire becomes right winger, and Fred becomes center midfielder.
5. **Gertrude and Dave switch positions.** Gertrude becomes cheerleader, and Dave becomes fullback.
6. **Eve and Fred switch positions.** Eve becomes right winger, and Fred becomes center midfielder.
7. **Fred and Bob switch positions.** Fred becomes striker, and Bob becomes right winger.

**So, who is Claire playing?**

* **(A) Cheerleader**
* **(B) Benchwarmer**
* **(C) Striker**
* **(D) Center Midfielder**
* **(E) Fullback**
* **(F) Left Winger**
* **(G) Right Winger**


 
Let me know if you want to try another one! 
"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a ball of a certain color.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* Alice and Fred swap, so Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
* Gertrude and Fred swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, so Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
* Alice and Bob swap, so Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
* Claire and Fred swap, so Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

The last person to swap is Eve.  She ends up with the blue ball. 

**So the answer is (C).**

**Answer:** (G) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

It sounds like they're trading books all semester long.  Here's how we can figure out who has what book at the end:

* **Start:**  Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  They trade books with each other.

Let's think about the swaps:

* **Fred and Dave:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve got a book Fred traded.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Alice and Bob:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve got a book Bob traded.
* **Dave and Alice:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Fred and Claire:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.

It looks like they're trading books in a circle.  

**So, who has what book at the end?**

* **Gertrude:**  Ulysses
* **Bob:**  The Great Gatsby
* **Dave:**  The Odyssey
* **Alice:**  Moby Dick
* **Eve:**  The Pearl
* **Fred:**  Frankenstein
* **Claire:**  Hound of the Baskervilles 



 
 
 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

2. Dave and Eve switch places.
3. Gertrude and Eve switch places.
4. Fred and Bob switch places.
5. Claire and Fred switch places.
6. Gertrude and Alice switch places.
7. Dave and Fred switch places.

So, Eve is left midfielder, then she becomes a cheerleader.  

The answer is **(A) cheerleader.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Gertrude switch partners, and then Fred and Gertrude switch partners again.  So, Fred is now dancing with Gertrude. 

The answer is **(B) Karl**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Bob and Fred switch partners:**  This means Fred now dances with Helga, and Bob dances with Melissa.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners:** This means Gertrude now dances with Izzi, and Eve now dances with Rodrigo.
* **Fred and Bob switch partners:** This means Fred now dances with Melissa, and Bob now dances with Izzi.
* **Claire and Fred switch partners:** This means Claire now dances with Melissa, and Fred now dances with Izzi.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** This means Alice now dances with Izzi, and Bob now dances with Rodrigo.
* **Claire and Bob switch partners:** This means Claire now dances with Rodrigo, and Bob now dances with Izzi.
* **Bob and Dave switch partners:** This means Bob now dances with Izzi, and Dave now dances with Ophelia.

So, Fred is now dancing with Izzi. 


The answer is **(E)**.

"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade them with each other.  Let's see who gets which ball after all the trades.

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  Gertrude gives Bob her ball.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave takes Bob's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave takes Fred's ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude takes Dave's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve takes Alice's ball.

Now, we need to figure out who has the ball at the end.  

**The answer is (A) black ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone is switching partners.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Gertrude and Alice switch:**  This changes Alice's partner.
* **Dave and Claire switch:** This changes Claire's partner.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** This changes Bob's partner.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch:** This changes Eve's partner.
* **Claire and Fred switch:** This changes Fred's partner.
* **Fred and Alice switch:** This changes Alice's partner.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** This changes Dave's partner.

Now, let's think about who is left with who at the end.

* Fred and Bob swap, so Bob gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Bob's ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Alice gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Alice's ball.
* Bob and Gertrude swap, so Gertrude gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Gertrude's ball.
* Bob and Claire swap, so Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.

Now, look at the end.  Who has the yellow ball?

* Dave and Eve swap books.
* Claire and Bob swap books.
* Eve and Bob swap books.

* **Then, Alice and Dave switch places again.**
* **Then, Claire and Fred switch places.**

* **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, and Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, and Bob gets Claire's black ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her blue ball, and Alice gets Dave's blue ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his orange ball, and Fred gets Bob's orange ball.

So, Dave is the only one who has a ball that hasn't been traded. 

**The answer is (A) brown ball.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

It sounds like they're trading books, and we need to figure out who has which book at the end.  

Here's how we can do it:

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Swaps:**  They trade books, and we need to see who got which book.

Let's think about who got which book at the beginning. 

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means they both started with different books.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** This means Dave started with a different book than Gertrude.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Dave started with a different book than Claire.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice and Bob started with different books.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve and Claire started with different books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** This means Alice and Gertrude started with different books.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Bob and Alice started with different books.

**The key is to keep track of who started with which book.** 

**Here's a possible solution:**

1. **Gertrude:** Frankenstein
2. **Fred:** The Pearl
3. **Dave:** The Odyssey
4. **Claire:** The Great Gatsby
5. **Alice:** Hound of the Baskervilles
6. **Bob:** Lolita
7. **Eve:** Ulysses

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Alice starts as striker.**
* **Eve and Alice switch positions.**  Eve becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Bob switch positions.** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Bob becomes the striker.
* **Fred and Alice switch positions.** Fred becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch positions.** Gertrude becomes the benchwarmer, and Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Eve switch positions.** Alice becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob switch positions.** Claire becomes the center midfielder, and Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Alice switch positions.** Fred becomes the center midfielder, and Alice becomes the right winger.

**So, Claire is now playing center midfielder!** 

The answer is **(C).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Dave and Bob switched partners, then Eve and Claire switched partners.  Then Claire and Gertrude switched partners.  

After that, Alice and Eve switched partners.  Then Gertrude and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Eve and Fred switched partners. 

So, we need to figure out who Dave is dancing with at the end.

"Okay, let's break down the game!

First, Eve and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Dave and Alice swap balls.  Then, Fred and Dave swap balls.  And so on.  

It looks like they keep trading balls back and forth.  

The final ball distribution is important.  We need to figure out who has the ball that is left. 

**The answer is (E) yellow ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners.  Let's see who ends up with who:

1. **Bob and Dave switch partners:**  This means Dave is now with Ophelia.
2. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:** This means Fred is now with Alice.
3. **Fred and Bob switch partners:** This means Bob is now with Gertrude.
4. **Eve and Bob switch partners:** This means Eve is now with Gertrude.
5. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** This means Alice is now with Bob.
6. **Fred and Claire switch partners:** This means Claire is now with Eve.

So, at the end, Alice is dancing with Bob. 

The answer is **(C) Ophelia**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this gift swap! 

First, we know that Alice and Eve swapped gifts, then Eve and Fred, and so on.  

Here's what we need to figure out:

* **Who has the red present?**  We need to see if any of the swaps made Claire get the red present. 


Let me know if you want to try another one! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Gertrude swapped books first, so Eve now has Gertrude's book. Then Bob and Eve swapped books, so Bob now has Eve's book.  

We can keep going like this, but it's a little tricky!  

**So, what's the answer?**

* (A) The Odyssey
* (B) Catch-22
* (C) Ulysses
* (D) Lolita
* (E) The Fellowship of the Ring
* (F) Moby Dick
* (G) The Great Gatsby 


 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Eve starts as the striker.  Then, some players switch positions.  Here's what we know:

* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the center midfielder, and Dave becomes the cheerleader.
* **Dave and Gertrude switch:** Dave becomes the left winger, and Gertrude becomes the fullback.
* **Fred and Claire switch:** Fred becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the left midfielder.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve becomes the fullback, and Claire becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire becomes the left winger, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.
* **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve becomes the striker, and Fred becomes the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice becomes the center midfielder, and Claire becomes the left winger.

So, Eve is now playing striker. 

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Alice starts as a left midfielder.  Then, she and Dave switch places.  Then, she and Claire switch places.  Then, they switch places again.  Then, Claire and Fred switch places.  Then, Dave and Eve switch places.  Finally, Gertrude and Bob switch places. 

So, let's see where Alice ends up:

* **Alice starts:** Left Midfielder
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Left Midfielder becomes Left Winger
* **Alice and Claire trade:** Left Winger becomes Benchwarmer
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Left Winger becomes Center Midfielder
* **Claire and Fred trade:** Center Midfielder becomes Left Winger

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Dave swap balls a few times, and then Eve and Fred swap.  Then, Eve and Alice swap.  We also know that Bob and Alice swap.  Finally, Gertrude and Claire swap. 

The last swap is between Alice and Dave.  

So, who has the pink ball? 


**Answer: (G)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:**
    * Bob is a right winger.
    * Claire is a center midfielder.
    * Dave is a fullback.
    * Eve is a left winger.
    * Fred is a cheerleader.
    * Gertrude is a striker.

* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave becomes a left winger, Eve becomes a fullback.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve becomes a right winger, Alice becomes a fullback.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes a striker, Gertrude becomes a center midfielder.
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes a fullback, Dave becomes a right winger.
* **Bob and Dave trade:** Bob becomes a right winger, Dave becomes a center midfielder.
* **Claire and Dave trade:** Claire becomes a center midfielder, Dave becomes a right winger.
* **Gertrude and Claire trade:** Gertrude becomes a center midfielder, Claire becomes a striker.

**So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing right winger.** 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's yellow ball and Eve gets Alice's purple ball.
* Dave and Fred swap, so Dave gets Fred's pink ball and Fred gets Dave's white ball.
* Alice and Gertrude swap, so Alice gets Gertrude's black ball and Gertrude gets Alice's purple ball.
* Fred and Claire swap, so Fred gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Fred's white ball.
* Bob and Fred swap, so Bob gets Fred's white ball and Fred gets Bob's brown ball.
* Gertrude and Bob swap, so Gertrude gets Bob's brown ball and Bob gets Gertrude's black ball.
* Finally, Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's blue ball and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.

Now, look at the end.  Alice has the purple ball! 

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve starts with Jamie. Then, Fred and Claire switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Dave and Eve switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Alice and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Fred and Claire switch partners. 

So, Eve is dancing with Jamie at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(G) Jamie**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Dave starts with an orange present.  Here's how the swaps go:

1. Dave and Fred swap.  Dave gets a yellow present, Fred gets an orange present.
2. Bob and Fred swap. Bob gets a yellow present, Fred gets an orange present.
3. Gertrude and Dave swap. Gertrude gets an orange present, Dave gets a blue present.
4. Dave and Claire swap. Dave gets a pink present, Claire gets an orange present.
5. Dave and Eve swap. Dave gets a purple present, Eve gets an orange present.
6. Claire and Bob swap. Claire gets a black present, Bob gets a purple present.
7. Dave and Alice swap. Dave gets a white present, Alice gets a black present.

So, Dave ends up with the blue present! 

**Answer: (A)**

* **Alice and Bob switch partners.**  
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners.**
* **Alice and Claire switch partners.**
* **Eve and Dave switch partners.**
* **Bob and Alice switch partners.**
* **Bob and Fred switch partners.**
* **Bob and Eve switch partners.**

Let's look at the final partners:

* **Claire is now dancing with Rodrigo.** 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Here's what we can figure out:

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  This means Bob gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Bob's present.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Claire's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Gertrude's present.

* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Fred's present.

Now, we need to figure out who has the pink ball. 



**Answer:** (B) pink ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's how we can figure out who has the ball at the end:

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  Dave gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Fred gets a new ball.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Bob gets a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice gets a new ball.

**So, who has the ball at the end?**

* **(A) orange ball**
* **(B) red ball**
* **(C) purple ball**
* **(D) blue ball**
* **(E) green ball**
* **(F) pink ball**
* **(G) brown ball** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Alice is with Lola, Bob is with Helga, Claire is with Sam, Dave is with Melissa, Eve is with Jamie, Fred is with Rodrigo, and Gertrude is with Patrick.
* **Dave and Claire switch:**  Dave and Claire switch partners.
* **Gertrude and Claire switch:** Gertrude and Claire switch partners.

* **Gertrude and Eve switch:** Gertrude and Eve switch partners.
* **Fred and Claire switch:** Fred and Claire switch partners.

* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve and Claire switch partners.

So, let's look at the final partners:

* **Alice is now with...**  

**Answer: (B) Lola** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  

* Eve and Dave swap, so now Dave has Eve's present.
* Alice and Bob swap, so now Bob has Alice's present.
* Bob and Gertrude swap, so now Gertrude has Bob's present.
* Gertrude and Fred swap, so now Fred has Gertrude's present.
* Dave and Gertrude swap, so now Dave has Gertrude's present.
* Alice and Claire swap, so now Claire has Alice's present.
* Claire and Bob swap, so now Bob has Claire's present.

Now, we need to figure out what Dave has.  

**The answer is (E) black ball.**

"Okay, so let's look at the trades:

1. Fred and Eve switch places.
2. Then Eve and Claire switch places.
3. Then Gertrude and Alice switch places.
4. Dave and Bob switch places.
5. Then Claire and Alice switch places again.
6. Finally, Bob and Alice switch places.
7.  And last, Gertrude and Eve switch places.

So, who ends up where? Eve is the one who switches the most, and she ends up in the left winger position. 

The answer is **(E)**.

6. Bob and Fred switch partners.
7. Fred and Claire switch partners.

"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see what happens:

* **First swap:** Claire and Bob trade their balls.
* **Second swap:** Alice and Gertrude trade their balls.
* **Third swap:** Claire and Dave trade their balls.
* **Fourth swap:** Dave and Gertrude trade their balls.
* **Fifth swap:** Eve and Fred trade their balls.
* **Sixth swap:** Bob and Eve trade their balls.
* **Seventh swap:** Gertrude and Claire trade their balls.

Now, the important thing is to see who ends up with each color ball at the end.  

**The answer is (E) purple.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Bob switched partners, then Eve and Fred switched partners.  Then Claire and Alice switched partners.  Then Eve and Alice switched partners again.  Finally, Alice and Gertrude switched partners. 

Now, we need to figure out who Fred is dancing with.  Let's look at the last few moves:

* **Alice and Gertrude switched partners.**  This means Fred is now dancing with someone else. 
* **Alice and Gertrude switched partners.**  This means Fred is now dancing with someone else. 

So, Fred is dancing with Sam. 


**The answer is (B).**

"Okay, so let's think about the game! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her orange ball, and Eve gives Alice her yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her orange ball, and Claire gives Alice her brown ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob gives Claire his white ball, and Claire gives Bob his brown ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude his red ball, and Gertrude gives Dave his green ball.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his white ball, and Fred gives Bob his black ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her yellow ball, and Claire gives Eve her brown ball.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** Gertrude gives Dave his green ball, and Dave gives Gertrude his red ball.

**The final ball:** Gertrude has the green ball. 

So the answer is (C).

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Bob and Dave switch partners.**
2. **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**
3. **Fred and Bob switch partners.**
4. **Eve and Bob switch partners.**
5. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
6. **Fred and Claire switch partners.**
7. **Claire and Eve switch partners.**

Now, let's think about who Fred is dancing with at the end.  

**The answer is (D) Melissa.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  We have a bunch of people with different colored presents.
* **Swaps:**  People swap gifts with each other. 

Let's see what happens:

1. **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  This means Bob gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Bob's present.
2. **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Dave's present.
3. **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  This means Eve gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Eve's present.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Dave's present.
5. **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Dave's present.
6. **Fred and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Alice's present.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Eve's present.

**The final gift:**

* **Claire:**  We need to figure out what Claire's present is. 

**The answer is (D) orange ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We need to figure out who has which book at the end.  

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Gertrude's book and Gertrude gets Dave's book.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** This means Eve gets Fred's book and Fred gets Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:** This means Bob gets Gertrude's book and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's book and Claire gets Alice's book.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Claire gets Eve's book and Eve gets Claire's book.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Bob gets Eve's book and Eve gets Bob's book.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's book and Bob gets Alice's book.

Now, we need to figure out who has Claire's book.  The only way Claire can have a book is if she swapped with Alice and then with Eve. 



**Answer:**  (E) Ulysses 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:**
    * Alice is the left midfielder.
    * Bob is the center midfielder.
    * Claire is the benchwarmer.
    * Dave is the cheerleader.
    * Eve is the striker.
    * Fred is the right midfielder.
    * Gertrude is the right winger.

* **Trades:**
    * Dave and Gertrude switch places.
    * Dave and Fred switch places.
    * Alice and Dave switch places.
    * Alice and Gertrude switch places.
    * Bob and Eve switch places.
    * Dave and Alice switch places.
    * Claire and Dave switch places.

* **Final Positions:**
    * Alice is now the center midfielder.
    * Bob is the striker.
    * Claire is the right winger.
    * Dave is the center midfielder.
    * Eve is the right winger.
    * Fred is the right midfielder.
    * Gertrude is the left winger.

**So the answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone is swapping gifts, and we need to figure out who has the orange ball at the end. 

Here's how we can figure it out:

1. **Start with the initial colors:**  We know who has what color gift at the beginning.
2. **Look at the swaps:**  We see that some people swap gifts with each other. 
3. **Think about the swaps:**  We need to figure out who got what gift after each swap. 

Let's see...

* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave gets the orange ball and Gertrude gets the blue present.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means Fred gets the purple present and Eve gets the red present.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This means Bob gets the white present and Fred gets the purple present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  This means Alice gets the blue present and Dave gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire gets the red present and Alice gets the blue present.

"Okay, let's figure out where Fred is playing at the end of the game!

* **Start:**  We know Fred is the right winger. 
* **Dave and Alice trade:**  Dave moves to benchwarmer, Alice moves to center midfielder.
* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes left winger, Claire becomes right winger.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude becomes left winger, Eve becomes fullback.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes center midfielder, Alice becomes right winger.
* **Bob and Gertrude trade:** Bob becomes fullback, Gertrude becomes center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes right winger, Alice becomes fullback.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Bob becomes left winger.

**So, Fred is still the right winger!**

We know everyone gets a new book at the start. Then they trade them around.  Let's see who gets what book at the end.

* **Alice and Bob:** They swap books, so Alice gets Bob's book and Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Claire and Eve:** They swap books, so Claire gets Eve's book and Eve gets Claire's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** They swap books again, so Eve gets Bob's book and Bob gets Eve's book.
* **Eve and Dave:** They swap books again, so Eve gets Dave's book and Dave gets Eve's book.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** They swap books, so Fred gets Gertrude's book and Gertrude gets Fred's book.
* **Dave and Claire:** They swap books, so Dave gets Claire's book and Claire gets Dave's book.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap books again, so Fred gets Eve's book and Eve gets Fred's book.

Now, we know that Fred and Eve swap books at the end.  So, Eve has Fred's book. 

**The answer is (E) Frankenstein.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners throughout the song.  Let's see who ends up with who:

* **Alice and Gertrude switch partners:**  Alice is now with Bob, Gertrude is now with Dave.
* **Dave and Gertrude switch partners:**  Dave is now with Alice, Gertrude is now with Bob.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch partners:**  Fred is now with Eve, Gertrude is now with Dave.
* **Eve and Bob switch partners:** Eve is now with Dave, Bob is now with Izzi.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:**  Gertrude is now with Dave, Alice is now with Bob.
* **Dave and Eve switch partners:**  Dave is now with Eve, Eve is now with Bob.
* **Claire and Eve switch partners:**  Claire is now with Eve, Eve is now with Bob.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Bob. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a game of musical chairs! 

We start with everyone having a different color present.  Then, people swap gifts with each other.  

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means they switch their presents.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They also switch their presents.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  They switch their presents.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They switch their presents.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:**  They switch their presents.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  They switch their presents.
* **Fred and Bob swap:**  They switch their presents.

Now, the last person to swap is Bob.  What color is Bob's present? 

**The answer is (B) yellow.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Bob starts with Frankenstein.  He then trades with Fred, then Dave, and then Alice.  Then, he trades with Alice again.  Then, Claire and Alice trade books.  Finally, Claire and Fred trade books.  

So, who has Frankenstein?  

**The answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* Claire and Dave swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Gertrude and Eve swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Claire and Alice swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Alice and Gertrude swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Fred and Bob swap, so Fred gets Bob's ball.

The last person to get a ball is Fred, and he gets Bob's ball.  So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Alice starts with ""Lolita"".  Here's how the book swaps go:

* Eve and Gertrude swap books.
* Bob and Eve swap books.
* Alice and Gertrude swap books.
* Claire and Eve swap books.
* Eve and Alice swap books.
* Fred and Alice swap books.
* Eve and Dave swap books.

Let's see who ends up with what book! 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the positions are changing throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Fred is right winger, Bob is center midfielder, etc.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve becomes left midfielder, Gertrude becomes benchwarmer.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Bob becomes left midfielder.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob becomes fullback, Dave becomes left midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude becomes left midfielder, Claire becomes fullback.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob becomes left midfielder, Eve becomes fullback.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve becomes right winger, Alice becomes left midfielder.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred becomes right winger, Bob becomes center midfielder.

So, Fred ends up playing right winger! 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Here's how the swaps work:

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Eve's present.
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  Fred gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Fred's present.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Dave's present.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Alice's present.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Dave's present.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** Gertrude gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Gertrude's present.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Claire's present.

Now, we need to figure out what Alice has.  Let's look at the swaps and see if we can figure out what color she has.

**So, the final gift Gertrude has is the orange ball.**

"Okay, so let's think about the game! 

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gives Eve her purple ball, and Eve gets Alice's purple ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his pink ball, and Fred gets Dave's pink ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gives Gertrude her purple ball, and Gertrude gets Alice's purple ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gives Claire her white ball, and Claire gets Fred's white ball.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Bob's brown ball.
* **Gertrude and Bob swap:** Gertrude gives Bob his black ball, and Bob gets Gertrude's black ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gives Claire her black ball, and Claire gets Gertrude's black ball.

**So, at the end, Claire has the black ball!**

**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color ball.  The swaps are just changing who has which ball.  

* **Claire and Bob:**  This doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Claire and Dave:**  This doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Fred and Gertrude:**  This doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Fred:**  This doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Alice and Dave:**  This doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:**  This doesn't change the color of the balls.

So, Fred ends up with the ball that was originally held by someone else. 



**Answer:**  (A) purple ball. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Claire swap balls first, so Claire gets the purple ball. Then, Bob and Eve swap, so Bob gets the purple ball.  

Next, Claire and Alice swap, so Alice gets the purple ball. Then, Bob and Alice swap again, so Bob gets the purple ball. 

Dave and Eve swap, so Dave gets the purple ball. Finally, Fred and Gertrude swap, so Fred gets the purple ball. 

Then, Gertrude and Claire swap, so Gertrude gets the pink ball. 

**So the answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players are switching positions throughout the game.  Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Alice is striker, Bob is right winger, Claire is center midfielder, Dave is cheerleader, Eve is right midfielder, Fred is left winger, and Gertrude is left midfielder.

* **Fred and Eve trade:** Fred becomes left midfielder, Eve becomes right winger.
* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve becomes center midfielder, Claire becomes right winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude becomes left winger, Alice becomes center midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes right winger, Bob becomes center midfielder.
* **Claire and Alice trade:** Claire becomes left winger, Alice becomes striker.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes striker, Alice becomes left winger.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude becomes right midfielder, Eve becomes left winger.

**So, Dave is now playing right winger!** 


**Answer:** (B) 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this!

Fred starts with Frankenstein.  Then, there are a bunch of swaps, but Fred doesn't change books.  Finally, Bob and Alice swap books.  

So, Fred's book is the one that Bob and Alice swap.  

The answer is **(C) Frankenstein**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade with each other.  

* **Alice and Fred swap:**  Alice gives Fred her green ball, and Fred gets Alice's green ball.

* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gives Gertrude her purple ball, and Gertrude gets Dave's purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gives Dave his brown ball, and Dave gets Eve's brown ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gives Claire her pink ball, and Claire gets Fred's pink ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gives Bob her orange ball, and Bob gets Claire's orange ball.

So, who ends up with the purple ball? 


**Answer:** (E) 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Dave started with Lolita.  Here's how the book swaps went:

* Alice and Bob swapped books.
* Eve and Alice swapped books.
* Claire and Gertrude swapped books.
* Dave and Fred swapped books.
* Gertrude and Claire swapped books.
* Eve and Claire swapped books.
* Gertrude and Dave swapped books.

So, the last swap was between Gertrude and Dave.  Dave got the book that he didn't start with. 

The answer is **(D) Catch-22**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Fred switch partners, then Bob and Claire switch partners, and so on.  Let's see who Eve ends up with:

* Eve and Fred switch partners.
* Bob and Claire switch partners.
* Bob and Dave switch partners.
* Gertrude and Fred switch partners.
* Alice and Fred switch partners.
* Bob and Eve switch partners.
* Gertrude and Dave switch partners.

So, Eve ends up with Helga.

* **Alice and Dave** swap books.
* **Fred and Claire** swap books.
* **Dave and Fred** swap books.

**Answer:** (G) pink ball. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Here's what happens:

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.
2. **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Eve's present.
3. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Alice's present.
4. **Fred and Alice swap:** Alice gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Alice's present.
5. **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Bob's present.
6. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Gertrude's present.
7. **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Dave's present.

So, after all the swaps, Eve has the green present. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone is swapping gifts.  Let's see who gets what:

* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice's pink goes to Claire's blue.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave's brown goes to Bob's red.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice's pink goes to Gertrude's black.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire's blue goes to Gertrude's black.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's pink goes to Eve's yellow.
* **Fred and Dave swap:** Fred's white goes to Dave's brown.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire's blue goes to Alice's pink.

Now, we need to figure out who has the red present.  

**The answer is (E) red present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Gertrude starts with Karl. Then, Eve and Fred switch partners.  Then, Bob and Claire switch partners.  Then, Bob and Dave switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Then, Alice and Fred switch partners.  Then, Bob and Eve switch partners.  Finally, Gertrude and Dave switch partners. 

So, who is Gertrude dancing with at the end? 

**The answer is (C) Ophelia.** 



"
"Okay, let's break it down!

We know that everyone starts with a ball of a certain color.  Then, they trade with other people.  

* **Claire and Dave:**  They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Claire and Alice:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** They swap, so they each get a new ball.

Now, we need to figure out who has the ball that was originally Claire's.  

**The answer is (C) blue ball.** 



"
"Okay, so we have a bunch of people with balls, and they're trading them!  Let's see how it goes.

Here's what we know:

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **The Swaps:**  They trade balls in a specific order.

Let's look at the swaps:

1. **Claire and Bob:** Claire starts with red, Bob starts with black.
2. **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with pink, Claire starts with red.
3. **Fred and Gertrude:** Fred starts with blue, Gertrude starts with orange.
4. **Fred and Eve:** Fred starts with blue, Eve starts with white.
5. **Claire and Dave:** Claire starts with red, Dave starts with pink.
6. **Alice and Bob:** Alice starts with purple, Bob starts with black.
7. **Dave and Bob:** Dave starts with pink, Bob starts with black.

**The Final Answer:**  Eve ends up with the white ball. 

So the answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone gets a new book at the start of the semester. Then, they trade books throughout the semester.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Eve's.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's book is now Claire's, and Claire's book is now Fred's.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** This means Alice's book is now Fred's, and Fred's book is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire's book is now Dave's, and Dave's book is now Claire's.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** This means Bob's book is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's book is now Bob's.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** This means Eve's book is now Bob's, and Bob's book is now Eve's.

**So, the answer is (A) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Bob starts with a brown ball.**
2. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets the blue ball and Claire gets the brown ball.
3. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets the blue ball and Bob gets the black ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Claire gets the black ball and Bob gets the blue ball.

So, at the end of the game, Alice has the blue ball. 

**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **First:** Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Rodrigo, and Claire is with Patrick.
* **Then:** Claire and Alice switch partners.  
* **Then:** Bob and Alice switch partners. 

This means that after the first switch, Alice is with Patrick, and after the second switch, Alice is with Rodrigo. 


So the answer is **(C) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Alice has blue, Bob has orange, and Claire has brown.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets Alice's blue, and Alice gets Bob's orange.
3. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Alice's blue, and Alice gets Claire's brown.

So, at the end, Claire has the blue present! 

The answer is **(C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Alice starts as a cheerleader.**
2. **Alice and Claire switch positions.**  This means Claire becomes the cheerleader and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.
3. **Bob and Alice switch positions.**  This means Bob becomes the goalkeeper and Alice becomes the right winger.
4. **Claire and Bob switch positions.** This means Bob becomes the right winger and Claire becomes the goalkeeper.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing the goalkeeper! 


**The answer is (B).**

"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Alice has green, Bob has pink, and Claire has red.
2. **Bob and Claire swap:**  Bob gets red, and Claire gets pink.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets red, and Claire gets green.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets pink, and Bob gets green.

So, Alice ends up with the green present! 

The answer is **(C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **Start:** Alice is with Patrick, Bob is with Karl, and Claire is with Ophelia.
* **Bob and Alice switch:**  They switch partners, so Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is now with Patrick.
* **Alice and Claire switch:**  They switch partners again, so Alice is now with Bob, and Claire is now with Patrick.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with Patrick. 


**The answer is (C) Patrick.** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this:

* **Start:** Alice has pink, Bob has white, and Claire has orange.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets Alice's pink, and Alice gets Bob's white.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets Bob's white, and Bob gets Claire's orange.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets Claire's orange, and Claire gets Alice's pink.

So, at the end, Bob has the orange ball! 

The answer is **(C).** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Alice has an orange ball, Bob has a green ball, and Claire has a pink ball.
2. **Bob and Claire swap:**  Claire gets Bob's green ball and Bob gets Claire's pink ball.
3. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Claire's pink ball and Claire gets Alice's orange ball.
4. **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's green ball and Bob gets Alice's orange ball.

So, at the end, Claire has the orange ball! 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the trades:

* **Alice starts with The Odyssey.**
* **Bob gets Lolita.**
* **Claire gets The Great Gatsby.**

Now, let's see what happens in the trades:

* **Bob and Alice swap.**  This means Bob gets The Odyssey and Alice gets Lolita.
* **Alice and Claire swap.** This means Alice gets The Great Gatsby and Claire gets Lolita.
* **Bob and Alice swap again.** This means Bob gets The Odyssey and Alice gets The Great Gatsby.

So, at the end, Bob has The Odyssey. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it:

* **Start:** Alice is the goalie, Bob is the midfielder, and Claire is the benchwarmer.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire is now the midfielder, and Bob is the benchwarmer.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice is now the midfielder, and Bob is the goalie.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob is now the benchwarmer, and Claire is the goalie.

So, at the end of the game, Claire is the goalie! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this like a game of book trading!

* **Start:** Alice has *Hound of the Baskervilles*, Bob has *The Odyssey*, and Claire has *Catch-22*.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They trade books, so Claire gets Bob's book and Alice gets Claire's book.  So now Claire has *The Odyssey* and Alice has *Catch-22*.

* **Bob and Claire swap:** They trade again, so Bob gets Claire's book and Claire gets Bob's book.  Now Bob has *Catch-22* and Claire has *The Odyssey*.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Finally, they trade again, so Alice gets Bob's book and Bob gets Alice's book.  

**So, Bob ends up with *Catch-22*.**

"Okay, so let's think about this!

* **First swap:** Bob and Claire switch presents.  
* **Second swap:** Bob and Alice switch presents.

Since we don't know what color Bob starts with, we need to consider all possibilities. 

**The only way Bob ends up with the white present is if he started with the white present.** 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it:

* **Start:** Alice is in the right midfield, Bob is the goalie, and Claire is the left winger.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire moves to the right midfield, and Bob becomes the left winger.
* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the goalie.
* **Claire and Bob switch again:** Claire becomes the goalie, and Bob becomes the left winger.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing left winger. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this:

* Alice starts with Frankenstein.
* Then, Alice and Bob trade books, so Alice gets The Great Gatsby and Bob gets Frankenstein.
* Then, Claire and Bob trade books, so Claire gets The Great Gatsby and Bob gets Ulysses.
* Finally, Bob and Alice trade books, so Bob gets Ulysses and Alice gets The Great Gatsby.

So, Bob ends up with Ulysses! 

The answer is **(C)**.

"Okay, so let's think about this:

* **Alice starts with a red present.**
* **Bob starts with a black ball.**
* **Claire starts with a white present.**

Now, they swap gifts.  

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Claire's.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Alice's.

So, after all the swapping, who has the black ball? 


**Answer:**  (A) black ball 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Bob starts with a red ball.**
2. **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Bob gets Claire's purple ball, and Claire gets Bob's red ball.
3. **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice gets Claire's purple ball, and Claire gets Alice's brown ball.
4. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's red ball, and Bob gets Alice's brown ball.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts again, and we don't know what they got.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch gifts one last time.

The important thing is that the order matters.  So, we can't know for sure what Bob has at the end. 

**The answer is (None of the above)** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

* **Alice starts as left midfielder.**
* **Then, Alice and Claire switch positions.**  So Claire is now the left midfielder, and Alice is the right midfielder.
* **Then, Bob and Alice switch positions.**  This means Bob is now the left midfielder, and Alice is the fullback.
* **Finally, Alice and Claire switch positions again.**  This means Claire is now the fullback, and Alice is the right midfielder.

"Okay, so let's think about this:

* **First swap:** Bob and Alice switch gifts.  
* **Second swap:** Claire and Alice switch gifts.

Since Alice got Bob's pink ball and then Claire's purple present, she must have the pink ball. 

So the answer is **(B)**.

1. **Claire and Alice start:** Claire has a white ball, and Alice has a yellow ball. They swap, so Alice gets the white ball and Claire gets the yellow ball.

1. **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire gets Bob's present, and Alice gets Claire's present.
2. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Claire's present, and Bob gets Alice's present.

So, the only way Claire can end up with the yellow present is if she got it from Alice in the first swap.

**Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they switch their gifts. Since Alice starts with a red present, and Claire starts with a pink ball, they swap.
**Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they switch their gifts. Since Alice now has Claire's pink ball, and Bob has Alice's red present, they switch.
**Alice and Claire swap:**  This means they switch their gifts. Since Alice now has Bob's red present, and Claire has Bob's black ball, they switch.

"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Bob is with Sam, Alice is with Melissa, and Claire is with Karl.
2. **Bob and Alice switch:**  They switch partners, so Bob is now with Melissa and Alice is with Sam.
3. **Claire and Alice switch:**  They switch partners again, so Claire is now with Karl and Alice is with Bob.

So, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with Melissa. 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Alice starts with Frankenstein.  Then, Alice and Claire switch books.  So, Alice gets Lolita and Claire gets Frankenstein.  Then, Bob and Alice switch books.  This means Bob gets Frankenstein and Alice gets The Odyssey.  Finally, Claire and Bob switch books.  This means Claire gets The Odyssey and Bob gets Lolita. 

So, Alice has The Odyssey at the end. 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about this:

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Alice's, and Alice's present becomes Claire's. 
* **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Alice's.

So, who ends up with what?  Let's think about the starting colors:

* **Bob starts with the purple present.**
* **Alice starts with the orange ball.**
* **Claire starts with the blue present.**

After the swaps, Bob will have the blue present. 

**The answer is (C).** 



"

1. **Bob and Claire switch partners:**  This means they swap places.
2. **Alice and Bob switch partners:** Alice takes Bob's spot.
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners:** They swap places again.

Since they switched partners twice, and Claire started with Rodrigo, the final dance will be Claire with Rodrigo. 

So the answer is **(C) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* **Claire and Alice switch:**  This means Claire is now dancing with Bob, and Alice is now dancing with Lola.
* **Bob and Claire switch:** This means Bob is now dancing with Alice, and Claire is now dancing with Izzi.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** This means Alice is now dancing with Claire, and Bob is now dancing with Lola.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with Izzi. 

**The answer is (C) Izzi.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Alice has orange, Bob has white, and Claire has purple.

3. **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets the purple ball, and Bob gets the orange ball.
4. **Claire and Bob swap:** Bob gets the orange ball, and Claire gets the white ball.

So, Bob ends up with the orange ball! 


The answer is **(B)**.

4. **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the goalie.

So, at the end of the game, Bob is playing the striker position. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about this:

"Okay, so let's think about this like a game of book trading!

* **Start:** Alice has Ulysses, Bob has Catch-22, and Claire has Moby Dick.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They trade books, so now Alice has Moby Dick and Claire has Ulysses.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They trade again, so now Alice has Ulysses and Claire has Catch-22.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Finally, they trade again, and Bob ends up with Catch-22.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Bob starts with a blue ball.**
2. **Bob and Alice swap balls.**  This means Bob gives his blue ball to Alice, and Alice gets Bob's blue ball.
3. **Claire and Alice swap balls.** This means Claire gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Claire's ball.

So, at the end, Claire has the ball that was originally Bob's. 

The answer is **(C) blue ball.** 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it:

The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Alice starts with *The Odyssey*.  Then Bob gets *Moby Dick* and Claire gets *Catch-22*.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob now has *The Odyssey* and Alice gets *Catch-22*.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice now has *Moby Dick* and Claire has *The Odyssey*.

So, at the end, Alice has *Moby Dick*. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so here's how we can figure this out:

* **Start:** Alice has *The Odyssey*, Bob has *Lolita*, and Claire has *The Great Gatsby*.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets *Lolita* and Bob gets *The Odyssey*.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets *The Great Gatsby* and Claire gets *Lolita*.

"Okay, so let's think about this:

* **First:**  Alice is with Rodrigo, Bob is with Melissa, and Claire is with Jamie.
* **Then:** Bob and Claire switch partners.
* **Next:** Alice and Bob switch partners.
* **Finally:** Bob and Claire switch partners again.

This means they all switch partners a few times.  The last dance is with Claire and Jamie. 

So the answer is **(B)**.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This means Claire's present becomes Bob's, and Bob's present becomes Claire's. 
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice's present becomes Claire's, and Claire's present becomes Alice's.

So, after all the swapping, who has the green present?
