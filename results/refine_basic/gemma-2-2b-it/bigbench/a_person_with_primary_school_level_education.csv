"The baseball player lives in the second house.  The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.  So, the person who eats mangos lives in the first house. 

The answer is **1**. 
"
"Okay, let's solve this!

We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house.  And the person who likes blue lives to the left of the person who eats kiwis.  So, the person who eats kiwis must be in house 1.

The person who likes blue lives in house 2.

Now, we need to figure out where the person who likes white lives.  We know the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who likes green.

The person who eats apples lives to the left of the person who eats oranges.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 3.

The root beer person is to the right of the rose person, so the root beer person is in house 2.

The rose person is in house 1. 


**Answer:** The rose person lives in house 1. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* (A) 2
* (B) 5
* (C) 3
* (D) 1
* (E) 4

**Answer:**  (D) 1 



Let me know if you want to try another puzzle! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know there are two houses, one with a root beer lover and one with water.  We also know the people eat different things for lunch and have different cars.

* **Clue 1:** The person with the radio and the person who drives a truck live next to each other.
* **Clue 2:** The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
* **Clue 3:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
* **Clue 4:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

Let's see...

* **Clue 1** and **Clue 2** tell us the person with the radio is next to the person who drives a truck.
* **Clue 2** also tells us the person with the radio is to the left of the pizza person.

So, the truck driver and the pizza person are on opposite sides of the houses. 

* **Clue 3** tells us the root beer lover does not live in the first house.
* **Clue 4** tells us the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.

Now, we can figure out where the pizza person lives! 


**Answer:**  (A) 2

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know some things about the people in the houses:

* **House 1:** The tea drinker lives here.
* **House 2:**  Someone who likes milk lives here.
* **House 3:** Someone who likes yellow lives here.
* **House 4:** Someone who likes white lives here.

We also know that the people in the houses have different food for lunch and drinks.

Let's try to figure out where the person who likes green lives! 


**Here are the choices:**

* (A) 1
* (B) 3
* (C) 4
* (D) 2

Which one is the right answer? 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We have a bunch of clues about who lives in each house and what they like.  Let's see if we can figure out where the person who likes red lives!

**Here's what we know:**

* **Clue 4:** The dog owner lives in the third house.
* **Clue 8:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.

**Let's draw a little picture to help us:**

| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |
```

**Now, let's use the clues to fill in the picture:**

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 2:** The dog owner lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
* **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.
* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.

"Okay, let's try to figure this out! 

We have a bunch of clues about people and their houses.  We need to find out where the person with a bouquet of lilies lives.

**Here's what we know:**

* **People and their houses:**  We know there are 5 houses, and each person lives in one of them.
* **Drinks:**  Some people drink tea, root beer, water, coffee, or milk.

* **Clue 2:**  The person who eats oranges doesn't live in the third house.
* **Clue 3:**  The person who eats mangos doesn't live in the first house.
* **Clue 4:**  The person who wears running shoes lives in the third house.
* **Clue 5:**  The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes milk.
* **Clue 6:**  There's one house between the person who wears boots and the person who has daffodils.
* **Clue 7:**  There's one house between the person who only drinks water and the person who eats kiwis.
* **Clue 8:**  The person who drinks coffee lives to the left of the person who wears sandals.
* **Clue 9:**  The person who has daffodils lives to the left of the person who has a rose.
* **Clue 10:**  The person who has carnations and the cricketer live next to each other.
* **Clue 11:**  The baseball player lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 12:**  There's one house between the person who eats grapes and the person who has daffodils.
* **Clue 13:**  The person with lilies lives to the left of the person who eats grapes.
* **Clue 14:**  The person with tulips lives to the right of the person who drinks tea.
* **Clue 15:**  The person who wears loafers lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 16:**  The swimmer lives to the left of the golfer.
* **Clue 17:**  The person with lilies lives to the left of the person who eats grapes.
* **Clue 18:**  The person with daffodils lives to the left of the person who eats kiwis.

**Now, let's see if we can figure out where the person with lilies lives!**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know there's a golfer, a basketball player, and a soccer player.  We also know the people have different lunches and flowers in their houses.

* **Clue 3:** The soccer player lives in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The person with a vase of tulips doesn't live in the third house.

So, the person with the tulips doesn't live in the third house.

* **Clue 1:** The golfer lives to the left of the basketball player.
* **Clue 2:** The person with lilies lives to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
* **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's think about where the grilled cheese person could be. 

The answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know some things about the people and their houses:

* **House 4 has spaghetti.**
* **House 3 has the pianist.**
* **House 3 also has fried rice.**

We also know that the saxophonist doesn't live in the last house.

Let's try to put the pieces together! 


**Which house has fried rice?**

* (A) 5
* (B) 4
* (C) 1
* (D) 3
* (E) 2 


**Answer: (D) 3** 



Let me know if you want to try another one!

"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that the person who ate fried rice is to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.  

So, the science fiction book person has to be in house number 1. 

The answer is **1**. 
 
 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* We know the pianist lives in house 1.
* The person who likes white doesn't live in house 2.
* The person who likes root beer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.

So, the root beer lover can't be in house 2.  That means the root beer lover must be in house 3. 

The only other house left is house 1. 


**Answer:** House 1

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know a few things:

* **Clue 2:**  The person who had stew lives in the second house.
* **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives to the left of the violinist.
* **Clue 4:** The violinist doesn't live in the fourth house.
* **Clue 5:** There are two houses between the person who had fried rice and the fantasy book person.

"Okay, let's think about this!

* We know the coffee drinker lives next to the milk person.
* The person eating mangos is next to the person eating apples.
* The person eating apples is in the last house.

So, the person eating mangos must be in the first house. 

The coffee drinker is next to the milk person, and the milk person is in the second house. 

So, the milk person lives in house **2**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We have four houses and four people in them.  We know some things about them:

* **Shoes:** One person wears loafers, one wears high heels, one wears boots, and one wears sandals.
* **Colors:** One person likes green, one likes white, one likes blue, and one likes yellow.
* **Devices:** One person has a radio, one has a gameboy, one has a television, and one has a phone.
* **Sports:** One person is a cricketer, one is a tennis player, one is a golfer, and one is a swimmer.

We can use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

* **Clue 1:** The person who wears boots doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
* **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.

"Okay, let's think about this!

* We know the person eating mangos lives in house 1.
* We know the person with the rose lives to the left of the person with the lilies. 
* We also know the saxophonist doesn't live in house 1.

So, the person with the lilies must live in house 2. 

The person eating apples must live in house 2 because we know the person eating mangos lives in house 1. 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We have a bunch of clues about people and their stuff.  Let's see if we can figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

**Here's what we know:**

* **Clue 1:**  The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a phone.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes green lives next to the person who drives a convertible.
* **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water doesn't live in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 10:** The person who likes red lives next to the golfer.
* **Clue 12:** The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live next to each other.
* **Clue 14:** The basketball player lives next to the person who likes red.
* **Clue 16:** The coffee drinker lives next to the person who has a TV.
* **Clue 17:** The swimmer lives next to the person who only drinks water.

**Now, let's think about it:**

* **Clue 1:**  The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a phone.
* **Clue 2:** The person who likes green lives next to the person who drives a convertible.
* **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water doesn't live in the third house.
* **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.
* **Clue 10:** The person who likes red lives next to the golfer.
* **Clue 12:** The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live next to each other.
* **Clue 14:** The basketball player lives next to the person who likes red.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know a few things:

* **House 1:** The person wearing running shoes lives here.
* **House 2:** The person with a vase of tulips lives here.
* **House 3:** The person who likes tea lives here.

We also know that the person who likes kiwis lives next to the person who likes blue. 

Let's think about the other clues:

* **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk and the person who eats apples live next to each other.
* **Clue 6:** The person who wears boots lives next to the person who likes green.
* **Clue 8:** The person who eats oranges doesn't live in the third house.

Now, let's see if we can figure out where the person who eats apples lives! 


**Answer:**  (C) 1 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
* The mystery book reader lives to the left of the history book buff.
* The person with the computer lives to the right of the person with the phone.
* The mystery book reader lives to the left of the person with the television.

So, the mystery book reader is in house 1.  The person with the computer is in a house to the right of the person with the phone.  The person with the phone is in house 2.  The mystery book reader is to the left of the person with the television, so the person with the television is in house 3.  The science fiction book fanatic must live in house 3.

**The answer is 3.** 



"
"No, a person with St. Vitus's Dance would probably not win a ballet competition.  Ballet is really hard and you need to be really good at moving your body in a special way.  St. Vitus's Dance makes it hard to move your body in the way you need to for ballet. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 
"

"

"

"

**So the answer is B.** 
"
"If you're scared of bugs, growing seedless cucumbers is a good idea! 

Here's why:

* **That means less bugs for you to worry about!** 

So, if you're scared of bugs, seedless cucumbers are a good choice for your garden. 

**Answer: (A)**

"

**So the answer is B.** 
"
"Would it be hard to snowboard on Venus? 

**A.  No** 
**B. Yes**

Venus is super hot! It's like a giant oven.  It's also super, super windy and the air is really thick and bad for us.  We can't breathe it, and the ground is super hot and would melt anything.  So, no way we could snowboard there! 


"
"Charlemagne's dad, Pepin the Short, was a really important king, but he wasn't at the Battle of Tours!

"

"
"Okay, so, is Ariana Grande a good topic for a presentation about PTSD?

"
"Is Jack Black likely to win an award for music? 

a) Yes
b) No

"
"No, cucumbers aren't all the same!  Some are really crunchy, like the ones you might use in a salad, and some are softer and meatier. 

**So the answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, so you're asking if the show ""Rich and Morty"" could make someone who has a parent who drinks feel sad or upset. 

The answer is probably **yes**.  

Here's why:

* The show talks about grown-ups who drink too much, and that can make people feel sad or scared. 
* Sometimes, when people have grown-ups who drink too much, it can make them feel worried or scared. 
* It's like when you see a scary movie, it can make you feel scared, right? 


So, if someone who has a parent who drinks a lot watches this show, it might make them feel sad or scared.

Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Sam, and Claire is with Bob. Then, Bob and Eve switch partners, so Bob is now with Eve, and Eve is with Sam.  

Next, Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Eve, and Bob is with Melissa. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Bob, and Bob is with Melissa. Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Dave, and Claire is with Bob. 

So, Bob is dancing with Melissa at the end of the dance. 


**The answer is (A).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:**  Alice has brown, Bob has white, Claire has black, Dave has red, and Eve has purple.

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change anything.

* **Bob and Claire swap again:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change anything.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change anything.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob and Claire switched partners, then Alice and Dave switched partners.  Then, Bob and Alice switched partners again.  Then, Claire and Eve switched partners. Finally, Eve and Alice switched partners. 

So, who is Eve dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (C) Ophelia 
 
 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

First, we know Claire starts with a black ball.  Then, Claire and Bob swap gifts.  Bob gets Claire's black ball, and Claire gets Bob's pink ball.  

Then, Bob and Dave swap gifts.  Dave gets Bob's pink ball, and Bob gets Dave's orange ball.

Next, Eve and Claire swap gifts.  Eve gets Claire's black ball, and Claire gets Eve's brown present.

Finally, Bob and Alice swap gifts.  Bob gets Alice's red present, and Alice gets Bob's pink ball.

Dave and Claire swap gifts.  Dave gets Claire's black ball, and Claire gets Dave's orange ball.

"Okay, let's think about the game!

Eve and Bob swap balls, so Eve gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Eve's ball.  Then Eve and Dave swap, so Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.  Then Alice and Eve swap, so Alice gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Alice's ball.  Finally, Alice and Claire swap, so Alice gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Alice's ball.

So, Claire has the pink ball at the end! 

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Start:**  Alice has brown, Bob has black, Claire has blue, Dave has orange, and Eve has red.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  So now Claire has the brown present, and Alice has the blue one.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets the red present, and Eve gets the black one.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave gets the blue present, and Bob gets the orange one.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  Now Claire has the orange present, and Alice has the blue one.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Eve gets the orange present, and Dave gets the red one.

**So, the answer is (D) the blue present.** 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

First, we know Alice is with Izzi, Bob is with Patrick, Claire is with Helga, Dave is with Rodrigo, and Eve is with Karl. 

Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners. Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. Then, Eve and Bob switch partners. Finally, Claire and Eve switch partners again. 

So, who is Alice dancing with at the end? 

a) Rodrigo
b) Karl
c) Izzi
d) Helga
e) Patrick 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Eve starts as the goalkeeper.**  
* **Alice and Eve switch places.**  Eve becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Alice and Claire switch places.** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Bob switch places.** Dave becomes the fullback, and Bob becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Alice and Dave switch places.** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, and Dave becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Eve switch places.** Dave becomes the goalkeeper, and Eve becomes the striker.

So, Eve is now the striker! 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

Eve and Bob traded balls first, so Bob got Eve's orange ball. Then, Claire and Eve traded, so Eve got Claire's green ball.  Alice and Eve traded, so Alice got Eve's white ball.  Then, Dave and Alice traded, so Dave got Alice's brown ball. Finally, Bob and Alice traded, so Bob got Alice's orange ball. 

So, who has the white ball? 

**The answer is (C) white ball.**

"Eve gets The Odyssey at the end! 

Here's why:

* Eve and Dave trade books.  Eve gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Eve's book.
* Bob and Eve trade books.  Bob gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Bob's book.
* Claire and Eve trade books.  Claire gets Eve's book, and Eve gets Claire's book.

"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They swap gifts, but we don't know what they have.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  Eve gets Bob's gift, and Bob gets Eve's gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve gets Alice's gift, and Alice gets Eve's gift.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  Dave gets Alice's gift, and Alice gets Dave's gift.

So, the last gift is Dave's.  What color was the gift Eve had at the start? 

**Answer: (B) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the trades!

* **Alice starts with The Great Gatsby.**
* **Claire and Dave swap books.**  This means they switch their books.
* **Bob and Alice swap books.**  This means they switch their books.
* **Dave and Alice swap books.**  This means they switch their books.
* **Bob and Claire swap books.**  This means they switch their books.
* **Dave and Eve swap books.**  This means they switch their books.

So, at the end, Alice has the book that Dave and Eve swapped.  That means Alice has **Ulysses**. 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the fullback, Bob is the right midfielder, Claire is the cheerleader, Dave is the right winger, and Eve is the center midfielder.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the cheerleader.

* **Bob and Claire switch:** Bob becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the right midfielder.

* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the right winger, and Dave becomes the right midfielder.

* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Claire becomes the right midfielder.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the right winger.

**So, at the end, Bob is the right winger!** 

The answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

First, we know Eve and Bob switch partners. Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. Then, Dave and Alice switch partners. Finally, Dave and Claire switch partners. 

Now, we need to figure out who Eve is dancing with at the end. 

The answer is **(C) Ophelia**. 



"
"Eve is dancing with Patrick at the end of the dance. 

The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we know who is dancing with who at the start.  

Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.  Then, Dave and Alice switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners again.  Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners. 

Now, we need to figure out who is dancing with who at the end.  

* **Bob is dancing with Lola.**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Bob and Claire switched partners, then Eve and Dave switched partners.  Then Bob and Dave switched partners again.  Then Alice and Bob switched partners.  Finally, Bob and Eve switched partners. 

So, who is Eve dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:**  (B) Karl 
 
 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

Eve and Alice swap balls first.  Eve gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Eve's ball.  Then, Dave and Bob swap.  Dave gets Bob's ball, and Bob gets Dave's ball.  

Claire and Alice swap.  Claire gets Alice's ball, and Alice gets Claire's ball.  

Finally, Alice and Dave swap.  Alice gets Dave's ball, and Dave gets Alice's ball.

So, who has the ball at the end?  Eve has the white ball! 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

Eve and Claire traded balls, so Eve got Claire's blue ball and Claire got Eve's yellow ball. Then Bob and Dave traded, so Bob got Dave's green ball and Dave got Bob's brown ball.  

Then Eve and Alice traded, so Eve got Alice's yellow ball and Alice got Eve's blue ball. Finally, Claire and Bob traded again, so Claire got Bob's blue ball and Bob got Claire's yellow ball.

Now, who has the green ball? 


**Answer: (B) green ball** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Alice is on the right wing, Bob is on the bench, Claire is in the right midfield, Dave is the goalie, and Eve is cheering.

* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob goes to the right wing, and Alice goes to the bench.

* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave goes to the right wing, and Claire goes to the goalie spot.

* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice goes to the goalie spot, and Claire goes to the right wing.

* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve goes to the right wing, and Alice goes to cheering.

* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave goes to the bench, and Bob goes to the right wing.

**So, at the end, Eve is on the right wing!** 


The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the dance moves!

Eve and Bob switch partners.  Then Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then Dave and Eve switch partners.  Then Eve and Claire switch partners.  Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Dave dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Jamie** 
* **(B) Melissa**
* **(C) Rodrigo**
* **(D) Helga**
* **(E) Patrick** 



 
"
"Okay, let's think about the trades!

* **Start:**  Alice has *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Bob has *Moby Dick*, Claire has *The Pearl*, Dave has *Ulysses*, and Eve has *Frankenstein*.

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  Dave gets *Frankenstein* and Eve gets *Ulysses*.

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets *Ulysses* and Dave gets *Moby Dick*.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Claire gets *Moby Dick* and Bob gets *The Pearl*.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice gets *The Pearl* and Bob gets *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  Claire gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Eve gets *The Pearl*.

So, at the end, Dave has *The Fellowship of the Ring*. 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the trades!

* **Start:**  Bob has Moby Dick.  Alice has Hound of the Baskervilles. Claire has The Fellowship of the Ring. Dave has Catch-22. Eve has Frankenstein.

* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They trade books, so now Claire has Catch-22 and Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring.

* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice and Eve trade books, so Alice has Hound of the Baskervilles and Eve has Frankenstein.

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob and Eve trade books, so Bob now has Frankenstein.

* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave and Bob trade books, so Dave now has Moby Dick.

**So, Bob has Frankenstein!** 


The answer is **(E)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about the trades!

* **Start:**  Alice has Catch-22, Bob has The Odyssey, Claire has Moby Dick, Dave has Lolita, and Eve has Frankenstein.

* **Claire and Eve swap:**  Now Claire has The Odyssey, and Eve has Moby Dick.

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Now Alice has The Odyssey, and Bob has Catch-22.

* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Now Bob has Frankenstein, and Eve has The Odyssey.

* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Now Eve has Catch-22, and Alice has Frankenstein.

* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Now Bob has Lolita, and Dave has Frankenstein.

**So, Dave has Lolita!** 


The answer is **(B)**. 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know Alice starts with a red ball. Then, Bob and Claire swap balls.  Then, Claire and Eve swap.  Then, Alice and Dave swap.  Finally, Bob and Alice swap again. 

So, who has the ball at the end?  

* **(A) orange ball**
* **(B) brown ball**
* **(C) red ball**

Now, let's see who gets what color after the swaps:

1. **Alice and Claire swap:**  Alice gets Claire's blue present, and Claire gets Alice's red present.
2. **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Alice's red present, and Alice gets Bob's white present.
3. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's red present, and Alice gets Eve's pink ball.
4. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's brown present, and Dave gets Claire's blue present.

So, who has the blue present at the end? 


**Answer:**  (B) blue present 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

Eve and Bob switch partners, so Eve is now with Jamie. Then Dave and Alice switch partners, so Dave is now with Alice.  Alice and Claire switch partners, so Alice is now with Karl. Then Eve and Claire switch partners, so Eve is now with Bob. Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners, so Alice is now with Dave. 

So, Dave is dancing with **Alice** at the end!

"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the striker, Bob is the fullback, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the center midfielder, and Eve is the benchwarmer.

* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire moves to the fullback spot, and Bob moves to the left winger spot.

* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave moves to the left winger spot, and Claire moves to the center midfielder spot.

* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice moves to the fullback spot, and Bob moves to the striker spot.

* **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve moves to the center midfielder spot, and Dave moves to the benchwarmer spot.

* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice moves to the center midfielder spot, and Dave moves to the striker spot.

**So, Bob is now the striker!** 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about who has the book at the end!

* **Alice starts with The Pearl.**
* **Bob gets Frankenstein.**
* **Claire gets Ulysses.**
* **Dave gets Hound of the Baskervilles.**
* **Eve gets Moby Dick.**

Now, let's see how they trade books:

* **Bob and Dave swap books.**  This means Bob gets Hound of the Baskervilles and Dave gets Frankenstein.
* **Bob and Claire swap books.** This means Bob gets Ulysses and Claire gets Hound of the Baskervilles.
* **Dave and Claire swap books.** This means Dave gets Moby Dick and Claire gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Bob swap books.** This means Claire gets Frankenstein and Bob gets Moby Dick.
* **Alice and Eve swap books.** This means Alice gets Moby Dick and Eve gets Frankenstein.

So, at the end, Alice has Frankenstein! 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  Alice has purple, Bob has white, Claire has yellow, Dave has pink, and Eve has green.

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  They switch their gifts.  So now Alice has the yellow gift and Claire has the purple one.

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They switch again.  Now Bob has the yellow gift and Claire has the purple one.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  Dave and Alice switch gifts.  Now Alice has the pink gift and Dave has the purple one.

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Eve and Dave switch gifts.  Now Dave has the green gift and Eve has the pink one.

* **Second swap:** Eve and Dave trade balls.
* **Third swap:** Dave and Alice trade balls.
* **Fourth swap:** Alice and Claire trade balls.
* **Fifth swap:** Bob and Claire trade balls.

So, who has the ball at the end?  

The answer is **(B) green ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Eve is the striker, Bob is the right winger, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the goalkeeper, and Alice is the cheerleader.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the goalkeeper, and Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire becomes the goalkeeper, and Dave becomes the left winger.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Bob switch:** Eve becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Eve is playing the right winger! 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the dance moves!

* **First:**  Dave and Eve switch partners.
* **Then:** Alice and Claire switch partners.
* **Next:** Dave and Bob switch partners.
* **After that:** Alice and Eve switch partners.
* **Finally:** Eve and Dave switch partners.

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end?  

**What do you think?**

* (A) Jamie
* (B) Rodrigo
* (C) Melissa
* (D) Lola

"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  They switch gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Bob got Claire's gift, and Claire got Bob's gift.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Alice got Bob's gift, and Bob got Alice's gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  This means Alice got Eve's gift, and Eve got Alice's gift.

So, the last gift Bob has is the one he got from Dave.  

**The answer is (E) green present.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this like a game!

* Eve and Alice switch partners. This means Eve is now dancing with someone other than Alice.
* Claire and Eve switch partners. This means Claire is now dancing with someone other than Eve.
* Alice and Eve switch partners. This means Alice is now dancing with someone other than Eve.

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end?

"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.

"
"Okay, let's think about the dance moves!

Eve and Bob switched partners. Then Dave and Claire switched partners.  Then Claire and Bob switched partners again.  Then Dave and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Claire and Eve switched partners.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob starts with a black ball, and Alice starts with a purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This means Eve starts with a yellow ball, and Dave starts with a green ball.

So, who has the blue ball at the end? 

**Answer: (A) purple ball** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this like a game!

* **Alice gets a book:** She starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  They trade books, so Eve gets *The Fellowship of the Ring* and Alice gets *Lolita*.
* **Claire and Eve swap:**  Claire's book is now Eve's.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Eve's book is now Alice's.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Eve's book is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Bob's book is now Alice's.

**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Eve ends up dancing with Dave because they switched partners a few times.  

The answer is **(B) Helga.** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

So, Dave has the orange ball! 


**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* Alice and Dave switch partners.
* Claire and Eve switch partners.
* Eve and Bob switch partners.

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end?

"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:** Alice has brown, Bob has white, Claire has black, Dave has red, and Eve has purple.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They switch gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's gift is now Alice's, and Alice's gift is now Eve's.
* **Bob and Claire swap again:**  They switch gifts again.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts.

So, the last gift Alice has is purple!

"Okay, let's think about this!

* **Eve and Alice** swap, so Eve gets the purple present and Alice gets the orange ball.
* **Bob and Dave** swap, so Bob gets the blue present and Dave gets the brown present.
* **Bob and Alice** swap, so Bob gets the purple present and Alice gets the blue present.
* **Claire and Eve** swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.
* **Alice and Eve** swap, so Alice gets the orange ball and Eve gets the purple present.

So, Claire has the purple present!

6. **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets a black present, and Eve gets a pink present.

So, Dave ends up with the yellow present! 

The answer is **(E) yellow present**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Alice is playing!

* **Start:** Alice is the fullback.
* Eve and Bob switch places. Eve is now the right winger, and Bob is the right winger.
* Gertrude and Bob switch places. Gertrude is now the right winger, and Bob is the left winger.
* Bob and Dave switch places. Bob is now the left winger, and Dave is the right winger.
* Gertrude and Dave switch places. Gertrude is now the left winger, and Dave is the right winger.
* Bob and Claire switch places. Bob is now the cheerleader, and Claire is the right winger.
* Fred and Bob switch places. Fred is now the right winger, and Bob is the left winger.
* Alice and Eve switch places. Alice is now the right winger, and Eve is the left winger.

So, Alice is playing the left winger! 

**Answer: (E) left winger** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  Alice has a white gift, Bob has a yellow gift, Claire has a red gift, Dave has a black ball, Eve has a pink ball, Fred has an orange ball, and Gertrude has a purple gift.

* **Alice and Eve swap:**  Alice's white gift is now Eve's pink gift.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve's pink gift is now Fred's orange gift.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice's white gift is now Bob's yellow gift.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's red gift is now Dave's black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's pink gift is now Claire's red gift.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob's yellow gift is now Gertrude's purple gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's orange gift is now Alice's white gift.

So, Eve has Alice's white gift! 

**Answer:** (F) white present. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the trades!

* **Eve and Bob:** Eve switched places with Bob.  
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred and Claire switched places.
* **Bob and Fred:** Bob and Fred switched places.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob and Claire switched places again.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve and Alice switched places.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave and Gertrude switched places.

So, Bob is now playing Left Winger! 

The answer is **(F)**. 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

First, we know who has what ball at the start.  

* Alice has a green ball.
* Bob has a white ball.
* Claire has a yellow ball.
* Dave has a pink ball.
* Eve has an orange ball.
* Fred has a black ball.
* Gertrude has a brown ball.

Now, let's see who swaps with who:

* Bob and Gertrude swap.  
* Fred and Claire swap.
* Dave and Gertrude swap.
* Bob and Gertrude swap again.
* Alice and Claire swap.
* Gertrude and Claire swap.
* Eve and Claire swap.

Finally, Eve has the orange ball. 

So the answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Gertrude starts as the goalkeeper.**
* **Then, Bob switches places with Gertrude.**  Bob becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Alice switch places.** Eve becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the striker.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch places.** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Dave and Fred switch places.** Dave becomes the cheerleader, and Fred becomes the left midfielder.
* **Claire and Eve switch places.** Claire becomes the striker, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch places.** Fred becomes the center midfielder, and Gertrude becomes the striker.

So, Gertrude is now the striker! 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

We know that everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade balls with other people.  Let's see who gets the ball that was originally held by the person who traded with them.

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob her ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

So, who gets the ball that was originally held by Alice? 



**Answer:** (G) green ball 
"
"Okay, let's see! 

We know that Fred and Bob switched partners, and then Dave and Alice switched partners.  Then, Fred and Bob switched partners again.  

So, Fred is now with Ophelia. 

The answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's see!  

We know that at the start, Alice is with Ophelia, and then Dave and Eve switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Then, Dave and Claire switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Alice switch partners.  Then, Dave and Eve switch partners again.  Then, Bob and Alice switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Gertrude switch partners. 

So, who is Alice dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Lola**
* **(B) Ophelia**
* **(C) Patrick**
* **(D) Melissa**
* **(E) Rodrigo**
* **(F) Izzi**
* **(G) Jamie** 



 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  We also know that they swap gifts with each other.  

* **Bob and Eve swap:** This means Bob's gift is now Eve's gift, and Eve's gift is now Bob's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's gift is now Gertrude's gift, and Gertrude's gift is now Claire's.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** This means Gertrude's gift is now Dave's gift, and Dave's gift is now Gertrude's.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** This means Eve's gift is now Fred's gift, and Fred's gift is now Eve's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's gift is now Bob's gift, and Bob's gift is now Fred's.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire's gift is now Alice's gift, and Alice's gift is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This means Fred's gift is now Bob's gift, and Bob's gift is now Fred's.

So, we need to figure out what color gift Dave has at the end.

"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Fred is in the left midfielder spot.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  Claire moves to the right winger spot, and Fred moves to the left midfielder spot.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice moves to the striker spot, and Fred moves to the left midfielder spot.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve moves to the goalkeeper spot, and Alice moves to the striker spot.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** Claire moves to the right winger spot, and Fred moves to the left midfielder spot.

* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave moves to the right midfielder spot, and Fred moves to the left midfielder spot.

Fred is now back in the left midfielder spot! 


**Answer:** (F) 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

First, we know who is dancing with who at the start.  Then, we see some people switch partners.  

* Claire and Eve switch partners.
* Alice and Fred switch partners.
* Gertrude and Dave switch partners.
* Eve and Bob switch partners.
* Eve and Fred switch partners.
* Bob and Claire switch partners.
* Fred and Gertrude switch partners.

Now, let's see who Claire is dancing with at the end. 



**Answer: (E) Jamie** 
"
"Gertrude started as a center midfielder.  Then, she and Bob switched places.  Bob then switched with Eve.  Alice and Eve switched places.  Dave and Fred switched places.  Then, Gertrude and Bob switched places again.  Finally, Gertrude and Fred switched places.  So, Gertrude is now a center midfielder! 

The answer is **(D)**.

"Okay, let's think about the balls!

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Eve her ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gives Claire her ball.
* **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Bob her ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Dave her ball.
* **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his ball, and Fred gives Dave his ball.

So, at the end, Eve has the green ball! 

The answer is **(E).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  We know Alice has blue, Bob has brown, Claire has orange, Dave has red, Eve has black, Fred has purple, and Gertrude has green.

* **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  They switch their gifts.  So now Claire has green and Gertrude has orange.

* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  They switch their gifts again.  Fred now has orange, and Gertrude has green.

* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  They switch their gifts.  Gertrude now has black, and Eve has green.

* **Dave and Eve swap:**  They switch their gifts.  Dave now has green, and Eve has black.

* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They switch their gifts.  Dave now has black, and Alice has green.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with someone.  Let's look at all the changes that happened:

1. **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
2. **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
4. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
5. **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
6. **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
7. **Gertrude and Dave switch partners.**

Now, think about who might be dancing with Claire at the end. 


**Answer:** (C) Jamie 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Fred and Dave trade balls. Then, Gertrude and Claire trade balls.  Then, Dave and Bob trade balls.  

After that, Claire and Gertrude trade balls again.  Then, Alice and Fred trade balls.  Finally, Bob and Alice trade balls. 

The last trade is between Eve and Bob. 

So, who has the yellow ball? 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this like a game! 

We have six friends, Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude. They all got a new book to start the semester.  

Now, they trade books with each other.  

* **First swap:** Alice and Bob trade books.
* **Second swap:** Fred and Claire trade books.
* **Third swap:** Alice and Gertrude trade books.
* **Fourth swap:** Bob and Alice trade books.
* **Fifth swap:** Bob and Claire trade books.
* **Sixth swap:** Dave and Alice trade books.
* **Seventh swap:** Bob and Eve trade books.

Now, who has the book at the end?  Let's look at the swaps to figure it out! 


**The answer is (E) Frankenstein.**

"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that Alice starts with a green present.  Then, Gertrude and Eve swap presents.  Then, Gertrude and Bob swap presents.  And then, Bob and Dave swap presents.  

Now, we need to figure out what Alice has at the end.  Let's think about the swaps! 


* **Gertrude and Eve:**  Gertrude gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Gertrude's.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** Gertrude gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Gertrude's.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** Gertrude gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Gertrude's.
* **Bob and Dave:** Bob gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Bob's.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Alice's.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Dave's.
* **Claire and Alice:** Claire gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Claire's.

So, the answer is **(E) purple present**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  Alice has a white present, Bob has a black ball, Claire has a brown present, Dave has a blue present, Eve has an orange ball, Fred has a green present, and Gertrude has a purple present.

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Bob gets a white present, Alice gets a black present.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets a green present, Fred gets a blue present.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets a purple present, Gertrude gets a white present.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets an orange present, Eve gets a white present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets a brown present, Claire gets a green present.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave gets a black present, Bob gets a blue present.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets an orange present, Eve gets a green present.

Fred started with a green present and then got an orange present from Eve.  So Fred's present is now an **orange ball**. 

**Answer:** (E) 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Fred and Bob trade balls. Then Eve and Fred trade balls.  Then Dave and Eve trade balls.  It looks like they keep trading!  

Finally, Alice and Bob trade balls.  Then Dave and Fred trade balls.  And then Bob and Claire trade balls.  And last, Gertrude and Alice trade balls.

Who got the brown ball? 


**Answer: (F)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve and Dave swapped presents, then Alice and Bob swapped presents.  Then Bob and Gertrude swapped presents.  And so on.  

Now, let's think about who might have the presents at the end. 

* **Bob** got a yellow present from Gertrude. 
* **Eve** got a purple present from Dave. 
* **Fred** got a red present from Gertrude. 
* **Alice** got a blue present from Bob. 
* **Claire** got a brown present from Dave. 
* **Gertrude** got a pink present from Bob. 


So the answer is **(A) yellow present**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Fred starts as a fullback.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch places.  Then, Dave and Gertrude switch places.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch places again.  Then, Eve and Claire switch places.  Then, Eve and Bob switch places.  Then, Claire and Gertrude switch places.  Finally, Fred and Alice switch places.

So, Fred is now playing fullback! 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the ball!

1. **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  Claire gets the orange ball, and Gertrude gets the pink ball.
2. **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets the orange ball, and Alice gets the pink ball.
3. **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets the pink ball, and Claire gets the orange ball.
4. **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice gets the orange ball, and Dave gets the pink ball.
5. **Fred and Dave swap:** Fred gets the pink ball, and Dave gets the orange ball.
6. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets the orange ball, and Dave gets the pink ball.
7. **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets the orange ball, and Eve gets the pink ball.

"Okay, let's think about the game! 

We know Eve and Dave swap balls a few times.  Then Eve and Fred swap, and then Eve and Dave swap again.  

We also know that Alice and Bob swap, and Gertrude and Claire swap.  

Finally, Alice and Dave swap again. 

So, who has the white ball? 


**Answer: (B) white ball** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out what book Alice has at the end!

* **Alice** starts with **The Great Gatsby**.
* Fred and Alice swap books, so Fred gets **The Great Gatsby** and Alice gets **The Pearl**.
* Gertrude and Eve swap books, so Gertrude gets **The Pearl** and Eve gets **The Great Gatsby**.
* Alice and Eve swap books, so Alice gets **The Great Gatsby** and Eve gets **The Pearl**.
* Dave and Gertrude swap books, so Dave gets **The Pearl** and Gertrude gets **The Great Gatsby**.
* Gertrude and Claire swap books, so Gertrude gets **The Great Gatsby** and Claire gets **The Pearl**.
* Alice and Claire swap books, so Alice gets **The Pearl** and Claire gets **The Great Gatsby**.
* Dave and Bob swap books, so Dave gets **The Great Gatsby** and Bob gets **The Pearl**.

So, at the end, Alice has **The Pearl**. 


**Answer: (E) The Pearl** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end!

* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets Eve's book, Eve gets Fred's book.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** Gertrude gets Alice's book, Alice gets Gertrude's book.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets Claire's book, Claire gets Dave's book.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's book, Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, Fred gets Alice's book.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Dave's book, Dave gets Eve's book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's book, Alice gets Eve's book.

Now, we need to figure out who has Bob's book at the end.  

**The answer is (G) Lolita.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this like a game!

First, we know everyone gets a new book at the start.  Then, they trade books with each other.  

* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means they switch books.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They also switch books.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Fred and Claire swap:**  They switch books.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  They switch books again.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They switch books.
* **Eve and Fred swap:**  They switch books.

Now, we need to figure out who has the book that was originally Dave's.  

The answer is **(C) The Pearl**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the balls!

* **Bob and Alice:** They swap, so they switch their balls.
* **Alice and Claire:** They also swap, so their balls switch.
* **Bob and Fred:** They swap again, so their balls switch.
* **Claire and Fred:** They swap again, so their balls switch.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so their balls switch.
* **Alice and Dave:** They swap, so their balls switch.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so their balls switch.

Now, look at the end. Fred has the ball that was originally... 

**The answer is (F) orange ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:** Eve is the center midfielder, Bob is the goalkeeper, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the benchwarmer, Fred is the fullback, and Gertrude is the cheerleader.

* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice is now the fullback, and Fred is now the striker.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire is now the cheerleader, and Gertrude is now the left winger.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave is now the striker, and Alice is now the benchwarmer.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob is now the benchwarmer, and Dave is now the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob is now the center midfielder, and Eve is now the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve is now the left winger, and Alice is now the center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude is now the benchwarmer, and Dave is now the cheerleader.

So, Eve is now the goalkeeper! 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Alice is the left midfielder, Bob is the benchwarmer, Claire is the right midfielder, Dave is the cheerleader, Eve is the left winger, Fred is the goalkeeper, and Gertrude is the right winger.

* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes the right winger, Claire becomes the left midfielder.
* **Fred and Dave trade:** Fred becomes the cheerleader, Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, Bob becomes the left midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude becomes the left winger, Eve becomes the right winger.
* **Dave and Bob trade:** Dave becomes the left winger, Bob becomes the cheerleader.
* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave becomes the right winger, Eve becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes the left winger, Alice becomes the cheerleader.

So, Bob is now the cheerleader! 

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Gertrude is playing Striker! 

Here's why:

*  We know Gertrude started as a Left Midfielder.
*  Then, she and Alice switched places. 
*  After that, Bob and Alice switched places. 
*  Finally, Gertrude and Alice switched places again. 


So, Gertrude is now playing Striker! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **At the start:** Eve is the benchwarmer, Fred is the cheerleader, and everyone else has a specific spot.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice goes to fullback, and Bob goes to left winger.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave becomes the benchwarmer, and Eve becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Bob switch:** Fred becomes the left midfielder, and Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice becomes the center midfielder, and Eve becomes the left winger.
* **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire becomes the right midfielder, and Fred becomes the left midfielder.
* **Bob and Gertrude switch:** Bob becomes the left midfielder, and Gertrude becomes the fullback.

Now, Eve is the left winger! 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Alice is playing at the end!

* **Gertrude and Eve switch places:**  Gertrude goes to be a fullback, and Eve becomes a left winger.
* **Alice and Claire switch places:** Alice becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the right midfielder.
* **Eve and Dave switch places:** Eve becomes a cheerleader, and Dave becomes a fullback.
* **Bob and Alice switch places:** Bob becomes a left winger, and Alice becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Fred and Dave switch places:** Fred becomes a striker, and Dave becomes a left winger.
* **Alice and Gertrude switch places:** Alice becomes a left winger, and Gertrude becomes a striker.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch places:** Gertrude becomes a fullback, and Eve becomes a left winger.

So, at the end, Alice is playing the **goalkeeper**.

"Okay, let's think about who got which book!

* **Fred starts with The Great Gatsby.**
* **Eve and Alice swap books.**  
* **Claire and Alice swap books.**
* **Dave and Gertrude swap books.**
* **Bob and Dave swap books.**
* **Fred and Bob swap books.**

So, Fred got the book that Bob had! 

**The answer is (D) The Great Gatsby.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a partner.  Then, some people switch partners.  Let's see who switches with whom:

* **Bob and Fred switch partners.**  
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
* **Fred and Bob switch partners.**
* **Claire and Fred switch partners.**
* **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
* **Claire and Bob switch partners.**
* **Bob and Dave switch partners.**

Now, we need to figure out who Eve is dancing with at the end.  Let's look at the list of partners:

* **Eve is with Izzi.** 


So the answer is **(D)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Alice and Eve swap balls. Then, Dave and Fred swap balls.  They keep swapping until everyone has a different ball.  

The last person to have a ball is Eve.  So, Eve has the yellow ball. 

The answer is (G). 


"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Eve starts with a yellow present.**
* **Eve and Bob swap gifts.**  This means Bob now has Eve's yellow present.
* **Dave and Claire swap gifts.**  This means Claire now has Dave's green present.
* **Alice and Bob swap gifts.**  This means Bob now has Alice's purple present.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap gifts.**  This means Gertrude now has Alice's purple present.
* **Claire and Bob swap gifts.**  This means Bob now has Claire's white present.
* **Dave and Fred swap gifts.**  This means Fred now has Dave's green present.
* **Bob and Eve swap gifts.**  This means Eve now has Bob's orange ball.

So, Eve has Bob's orange ball! 


**Answer: (B)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Alice is the left midfielder.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:**  Dave becomes the striker, and Gertrude becomes the cheerleader.
* **Dave and Alice trade:** Dave becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the cheerleader.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes the striker, and Gertrude becomes the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve trade:** Alice becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Gertrude trade:** Claire becomes the striker, and Gertrude becomes the left winger.
* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the left winger.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve becomes the goalkeeper, and Bob becomes the left winger.

So, Alice is now the left winger! 


**Answer: (E)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Dave is with Melissa at the start.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners.  Eve and Dave switch partners.  Bob and Alice switch partners.  Bob and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Eve switch partners.

So, who is Dave dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Rodrigo** 
* **(B) Sam**
* **(C) Ophelia**
* **(D) Helga**
* **(E) Patrick**
* **(F) Izzi**
* **(G) Melissa** 



 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Alice starts with a red present.  Then, Claire and Alice swap presents.  Then, Eve and Gertrude swap presents.  And so on.  

Let's think about what happens to the gifts after each swap.  

* **Claire and Alice swap:**  Claire's present becomes Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve's present becomes Gertrude's, and vice versa.
* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice's present becomes Dave's, and vice versa.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Fred's present becomes Alice's, and vice versa.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  Bob's present becomes Fred's, and vice versa.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:**  Gertrude's present becomes Claire's, and vice versa.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  Dave's present becomes Claire's, and vice versa.

Now, let's think about what Alice has at the end. 


**What color is Alice's present at the end?**

(A) orange ball
(B) purple present
(C) red present
(D) pink ball

"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Claire is in the middle, Dave is in goal, Eve is on the left, Fred is on the left, and Gertrude is up front. Alice is at the back. Bob is sitting on the bench.

* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave goes to the back, Alice goes to goal.

* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave goes to the back, Bob goes to goal.

* **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire goes to the left, Fred goes to the middle.

* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred goes to the left, Alice goes to the middle.

* **Eve and Gertrude switch:** Eve goes to the front, Gertrude goes to the left.

* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude goes to the middle, Dave goes to the front.

* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve goes to the middle, Claire goes to the left.

**So, Claire is now on the left!**

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps!

* **Alice and Bob:** They traded books, so we know they switched.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They also traded books.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They traded books too.
* **Alice and Fred:** They traded books.
* **Dave and Eve:** They traded books.
* **Claire and Bob:** They traded books.
* **Eve and Bob:** They traded books.

Now, we need to figure out who has the book they got in the last swap.  Eve got the book she got in the last swap. 

**So the answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books with each other. 

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Alice and Bob:** They traded books, so they both got a different book.
* **Alice and Dave:** They traded books, so they both got a different book.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They traded books, so they both got a different book.
* **Bob and Alice:** They traded books, so they both got a different book.
* **Alice and Eve:** They traded books, so they both got a different book.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They traded books, so they both got a different book.
* **Dave and Eve:** They traded books, so they both got a different book.

So, at the end of the semester, Alice has the book that she traded with Eve. 

**The answer is (E) The Great Gatsby.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

**Here's how we can solve it:**

* **Think about the balls:**  We need to figure out who has which ball.
* **Look for patterns:**  Maybe there's a pattern in how the balls are swapped. 

**Let's start by thinking about who might have the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with the person who had the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with the person who had the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with the person who had the ball that was originally held by the person who swapped with the person who had the ball that was

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Eve switched partners. Then, Bob and Claire switched partners.  Then, Bob and Dave switched partners.  Then, Gertrude and Fred switched partners.  Then, Alice and Fred switched partners.  Then, Bob and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Gertrude and Dave switched partners. 

So, who is Fred dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:**  Fred is dancing with Ophelia. 

**So the answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  Bob has a white gift, Eve has a red gift, Claire has a pink ball, Dave has a black ball, Fred has a brown gift, and Gertrude has an orange ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets red, Eve gets white.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets orange, Gertrude gets pink.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude gets black, Dave gets orange.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gets brown, Fred gets red.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets white, Bob gets brown.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire gets yellow, Alice gets pink.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred gets orange, Bob gets yellow.

Now, the last swap is between Fred and Bob.  Fred gets orange, and Bob gets yellow.  So, Eve must have the brown gift!

**Answer: (F)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Alice is playing at the end of the game!

* **Start:** Alice is the left midfielder.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve becomes the fullback, and Fred becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob becomes the right winger, and Claire becomes the fullback.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob becomes the center midfielder, and Fred becomes the right winger.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Dave starts with Karl. Then, Alice and Fred switch partners.  Then, Alice and Claire switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Bob switch partners.  Then, Fred and Dave switch partners.  Finally, Alice and Bob switch partners. 

So, who is Dave dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (D) Helga 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, people swap gifts with each other.  

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Fred and Eve now have each other's gifts.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Bob and Gertrude now have each other's gifts.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Claire now have each other's gifts.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Fred now have each other's gifts.
* **Alice and Fred swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Fred now have each other's gifts.
* **Dave and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Dave and Eve now have each other's gifts.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know Alice and Eve now have each other's gifts.

So, we can't figure out who has what gift.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Eve started with Melissa. Then, Claire and Bob switched partners.  Then, Alice and Eve switched partners.  

Let's look at the options:

* **(A) Izzi:**  Izzi is not a partner for anyone.
* **(B) Ophelia:**  Ophelia is not a partner for anyone.
* **(C) Melissa:**  Melissa is Eve's partner.
* **(D) Sam:**  Sam is Bob's partner.
* **(E) Karl:**  Karl is Alice's partner.
* **(F) Patrick:**  Patrick is Claire's partner.
* **(G) Helga:**  Helga is Claire's partner.

So, Eve is with Sam at the end. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Fred starts with a white present.  Here's what happens:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Dave's present.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Dave's present.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Claire gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Claire's present.
4. **Dave and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Alice's present.
5. **Alice and Gertrude swap:**  This means Gertrude gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Gertrude's present.
6. **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Eve's present.
7. **Fred and Bob swap:**  This means Bob gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Bob's present.

So, Fred ends up with Bob's present! 

**The answer is (F) yellow.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who Fred is dancing with at the end!

* **Fred and Sam switch partners:** Fred is now dancing with someone else.
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners:** Eve and Gertrude are now dancing with someone else.
* **Claire and Eve switch partners:** Claire and Eve are now dancing with someone else.
* **Fred and Dave switch partners:** Fred is now dancing with someone else.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:** Claire and Alice are now dancing with someone else.
* **Fred and Gertrude switch partners:** Fred is now dancing with someone else.
* **Bob and Claire switch partners:** Bob and Claire are now dancing with someone else.

So, Fred is dancing with someone new at the end! 

**The answer is (E) Karl.**

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that at the start, Eve is with Rodrigo, and Gertrude is with Melissa.  Then, they switch partners.  

Then, Fred and Dave switch partners.  

Then, Alice and Bob switch partners. 

Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners. 

Then, Alice and Claire switch partners. 

Then, Dave and Alice switch partners. 

Finally, Gertrude and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Eve dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (F) Rodrigo

"Okay, let's see!  

We know that Dave and Eve switched partners. Then, Gertrude and Dave switched partners. Then, Bob and Gertrude switched partners. Then, Bob and Fred switched partners. Then, Alice and Eve switched partners. Finally, Bob and Claire switched partners. 

Now, we need to figure out who Bob is dancing with at the end. 

* **Bob is dancing with Melissa.**

"Okay, let's figure out what Gertrude has!

* **Start:**  We have Alice with pink, Bob with brown, Claire with red, Dave with blue, Eve with white, Fred with orange, and Gertrude with black.

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  Alice's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Alice's.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Claire's.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  Fred's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Fred's.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Eve's.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Eve's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Eve's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Gertrude's present is now Dave's, and Dave's present is now Gertrude's.

Now, look at the gifts.  Gertrude has the **black ball**! 

**So the answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Fred is playing!

* **Start:** Fred is on the left wing.
* Fred and Eve switch places.  Eve is now on the right wing.
* Eve and Claire switch places. Claire is now on the right wing.
* Gertrude and Alice switch places. Gertrude is now on the left wing.
* Dave and Bob switch places. Bob is now on the left wing.
* Claire and Alice switch places. Claire is now on the left wing.
* Bob and Alice switch places. Bob is now on the left wing.
* Gertrude and Eve switch places. Gertrude is now on the right wing.

So, Fred is now on the left wing! 

**Answer: (G)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out what book Dave has at the end!

* **Start:**  Everyone gets a new book to start.
* **Trading:**  They trade books with each other.

Here's what we know:

1. **Alice and Claire:** Alice has Catch-22, Claire has Lolita.
2. **Bob and Dave:** Bob has The Great Gatsby, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring.
3. **Dave and Fred:** Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring, Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles.
4. **Eve and Fred:** Eve has The Pearl, Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles.
5. **Alice and Dave:** Alice has Catch-22, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring.
6. **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob has The Great Gatsby, Gertrude has Frankenstein.
7. **Fred and Dave:** Fred has Hound of the Baskervilles, Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring.

**The End:** Dave has The Fellowship of the Ring. 

So the answer is **(F)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Claire got Hound of the Baskervilles at the start.  Then, she traded with Alice, Bob, and Eve.  

* Alice traded with Gertrude, so Claire got Ulysses.
* Dave and Fred traded, so Dave got The Pearl.
* Claire traded with Bob, so Claire got The Odyssey.
* Eve and Claire traded, so Eve got Ulysses.
* Fred and Alice traded, so Fred got Frankenstein.
* Claire and Dave traded, so Claire got Moby Dick.

So, Claire has Hound of the Baskervilles! 

The answer is **(A) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who Alice is dancing with!

We know that the dancers are switching partners.  Let's look at the changes:

1.  Bob and Dave switch partners.
2.  Dave and Claire switch partners.
3.  Claire and Eve switch partners.
4.  Alice and Gertrude switch partners.
5.  Alice and Bob switch partners.
6.  Bob and Fred switch partners.
7.  Fred and Eve switch partners.

Now, let's see who is dancing with who at the end. 


* **Answer:**  Alice is dancing with Helga. 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Swaps:**  People trade their balls with each other.

Let's see who gets which ball after each swap:

1. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives her ball to Alice.
2. **Eve and Claire:** Eve gives her ball to Claire.
3. **Claire and Gertrude:** Claire gives her ball to Gertrude.
4. **Bob and Alice:** Bob gives his ball to Alice.
5. **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives her ball to Alice.
6. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives his ball to Alice.
7. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives his ball to Fred.

**So, who gets the ball that was originally held by Eve?**

The answer is **(B) blue ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the books!

Fred got The Great Gatsby to start. Then, Fred and Bob traded books.  Bob and Gertrude traded books too. Fred and Gertrude traded books again.  Alice and Gertrude traded books.  Claire and Gertrude traded books.  And finally, Alice and Gertrude traded books again.  

The last trade was between Dave and Eve.  So, Fred must have the book that Dave and Eve traded.  

The book that Dave and Eve traded was The Pearl. 


**Answer: (D)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out where Alice is playing!

* **Start:** Alice is the cheerleader. Bob is the right midfielder. Claire is the right winger. Dave is the center midfielder. Eve is the fullback. Fred is the striker. Gertrude is the goalkeeper.

* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob becomes the cheerleader, and Alice becomes the right midfielder.
* **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire becomes the striker, and Fred becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude becomes the striker, and Fred becomes the right midfielder.
* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve becomes the striker, and Fred becomes the fullback.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice becomes the fullback, and Gertrude becomes the striker.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude becomes the center midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.

"Okay, let's think about the books!

* **Alice** got *The Great Gatsby* to start.
* **Bob** got *Catch-22*.
* **Claire** got *Ulysses*.
* **Dave** got *Moby Dick*.
* **Eve** got *Lolita*.
* **Fred** got *The Pearl*.

"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, people trade their balls with each other.  

* Dave and Fred swap.
* Claire and Dave swap.
* Eve and Bob swap.
* Gertrude and Claire swap.
* Alice and Gertrude swap.
* Bob and Claire swap.
* Bob and Alice swap.

So, who ends up with the ball that was originally Bob's? 


**The answer is (C) blue ball.** 



"

"Let's think about the books!

* **Alice got Ulysses.**
* **Bob got Frankenstein.**
* **Claire got Moby Dick.**
* **Dave got The Odyssey.**
* **Eve got The Great Gatsby.**
* **Fred got Lolita.**
* **Gertrude got The Pearl.**

Now, Fred got Lolita.  

So the answer is **(D).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Swaps:**  People trade their balls with each other.

Let's see who gets which ball after each swap:

1. **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude gives her blue ball to Alice.
2. **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives his green ball to Bob.
3. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives his green ball to Claire.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives her brown ball to Dave.
5. **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives her purple ball to Eve.
6. **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives her purple ball to Claire.
7. **Claire and Fred:** Claire gives her orange ball to Fred.

Now, who has the pink ball? 


**Answer:**  (B) pink ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure out where Bob is playing!

* **Eve and Fred trade:** Eve is now a fullback, and Fred is now the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Claire trade:** Bob is now a right winger, and Claire is now a fullback.
* **Bob and Fred trade:** Bob is now a center midfielder, and Fred is now a right winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude is now a left midfielder, and Alice is now a benchwarmer.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve is now a right winger, and Alice is now the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Dave trade:** Eve is now a center midfielder, and Dave is now the goalkeeper.

**Bob is now a center midfielder!** 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who Alice is dancing with!

* **Start:**  Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Helga, Claire is with Sam, Dave is with Rodrigo, Eve is with Melissa, Fred is with Izzi, and Gertrude is with Ophelia.

* **Gertrude and Fred switch:**  Gertrude and Fred switch partners.
* **Gertrude and Bob switch:** Gertrude and Bob switch partners.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice and Bob switch partners.
* **Eve and Dave switch:** Eve and Dave switch partners.
* **Bob and Gertrude switch:** Bob and Gertrude switch partners.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice and Claire switch partners.
* **Dave and Fred switch:** Dave and Fred switch partners.

Now, let's see who Alice is dancing with at the end! 

**The answer is (F) Sam.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Alice and Fred trade balls. Then, Claire and Eve trade balls.  Dave and Gertrude trade balls.  Eve and Dave trade balls again.  Dave and Fred trade balls.  Fred and Claire trade balls.  Finally, Claire and Bob trade balls. 

Now, who has the green ball? 


**Answer:** (G) 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, Gertrude is with Karl.  Then, Fred and Bob switch partners.  Then, Alice and Eve switch partners.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners again.  Then, Bob and Gertrude switch partners.  Then, Fred and Alice switch partners.  Then, Fred and Claire switch partners.  Finally, Dave and Bob switch partners. 

So, who is Gertrude dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Lola**
* **(B) Jamie**
* **(C) Patrick**
* **(D) Karl**
* **(E) Rodrigo**
* **(F) Izzi**
* **(G) Melissa** 


Let me know what you think!

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners.  Let's see who ends up with who:

1. **Alice and Claire switch partners.**  
2. **Bob and Fred switch partners.**
3. **Claire and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Alice and Fred switch partners.**
5. **Claire and Alice switch partners.**
6. **Bob and Eve switch partners.**
7. **Eve and Gertrude switch partners.**

Now, let's think about who is left with who at the end.  

**The answer is (D) Helga.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

Here's what we need to figure out:

* **Who got what gift?**  We need to know what gifts were swapped. 

Let's look at the swaps:

* Fred and Eve swap gifts.
* Gertrude and Alice swap gifts.
* Alice and Bob swap gifts.
* Alice and Dave swap gifts.
* Fred and Alice swap gifts.
* Eve and Alice swap gifts.
* Fred and Claire swap gifts.

"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who swaps with who.

Here's what we know:

1. **Claire and Dave:**  They swap balls.
2. **Fred and Eve:** They swap balls.
3. **Bob and Claire:** They swap balls.
4. **Eve and Alice:** They swap balls.
5. **Eve and Gertrude:** They swap balls.
6. **Bob and Dave:** They swap balls.
7. **Gertrude and Bob:** They swap balls.

**So, who gets the pink ball?**

* **(G) pink ball** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Alice starts with a pink present.  Here's what happens:

1. Fred and Eve swap presents.
2. Gertrude and Alice swap presents.
3. Alice and Bob swap presents.
4. Alice and Dave swap presents.
5. Fred and Alice swap presents.
6. Eve and Alice swap presents.
7. Fred and Claire swap presents.

Now, let's think about what Alice has at the end. 

**What color is Alice's present at the end?**

(A) Yellow
(B) Blue
(C) Red
(D) White

"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Then, people swap gifts with each other.  

* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  This doesn't change the color of the gifts.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  This changes the colors again.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This changes the colors again.
* **Alice and Eve swap:**  This changes the colors again.

So, the last person to have a gift is Gertrude.  What color is Gertrude's present? 

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Bob is playing at the end!

* **Start:** Bob is a right winger.
* **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Gertrude becomes the right winger.
* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave becomes the left winger, and Claire becomes the fullback.
* **Bob and Fred switch:** Bob becomes the fullback, and Fred becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude becomes the right winger, and Fred becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire becomes the benchwarmer, and Eve becomes the right winger.

So, Bob is now the **fullback**! 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade balls with each other.  

* Claire and Bob swap their balls.
* Dave and Claire swap their balls.
* Fred and Gertrude swap their balls.
* Fred and Eve swap their balls.
* Claire and Dave swap their balls.
* Alice and Bob swap their balls.
* Dave and Bob swap their balls.

So, who gets the blue ball? 


**Answer:** (A)

**So, at the end of the game, Gertrude is playing left midfielder!**

"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that Fred has a black ball to start.  Then, people swap gifts.  

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This doesn't change Fred's present.

So, Fred's present stays the same! 


**Answer:** (C) black ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone got a new book at the start of the semester. Then, they traded books with each other.  

* **Alice and Bob:** They traded books.
* **Dave and Bob:** They also traded books.
* **Alice and Eve:** They traded books.
* **Gertrude and Dave:** They traded books.
* **Fred and Dave:** They traded books.
* **Bob and Fred:** They traded books.
* **Bob and Claire:** They traded books.

Now, we need to figure out who has which book at the end. 

**The answer is (B) The Fellowship of the Ring.** 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

We need to figure out who has the white ball at the end.  

Here's what we know:

* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  Bob gets a brown ball, Gertrude gets a white ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets a yellow ball, Claire gets a pink ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets a yellow ball, Gertrude gets a pink ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets a pink ball, Gertrude gets a yellow ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets a pink ball, Claire gets a green ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets a green ball, Claire gets a brown ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets a brown ball, Claire gets an orange ball.

So, the last person to have the white ball is Bob! 


**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this like a game! 

We know everyone got a new book at the start. Then they traded books with each other.  

* **Bob and Claire traded:**  This means they both got a book they didn't have at the beginning.
* **Eve and Alice traded:**  This means Eve and Alice got a book they didn't have at the beginning.
* **Alice and Dave traded:**  This means Alice and Dave got a book they didn't have at the beginning.
* **Gertrude and Dave traded:**  This means Gertrude and Dave got a book they didn't have at the beginning.
* **Alice and Bob traded:**  This means Alice and Bob got a book they didn't have at the beginning.
* **Eve and Claire traded:**  This means Eve and Claire got a book they didn't have at the beginning.
* **Alice and Fred traded:**  This means Alice and Fred got a book they didn't have at the beginning.

Now, we need to figure out who has which book at the end.  

**The answer is (E) Ulysses.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the books!

Fred got Lolita to start.  Then, Bob and Claire traded books.  That doesn't change Fred's book.  Then, Dave and Bob traded books.  That doesn't change Fred's book either.  Claire and Fred traded books, so Fred now has Claire's book.  Then, Claire and Dave traded books, so Fred now has Dave's book.  Fred then traded with Eve, and then Alice and Dave traded books.  Finally, Fred traded with Gertrude. 

So, Fred has Catch-22! 


**The answer is (E).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, people trade their balls with each other.  

* Alice and Fred swap, so Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.
* Gertrude and Fred swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, so Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.
* Alice and Bob swap, so Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.
* Claire and Fred swap, so Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

Now, who has the yellow ball? 


**Answer: (F) yellow ball** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Alice is on the bench, Bob is the striker, Claire is on the right wing, Dave is in the middle, Eve is cheering, Fred is on the left wing, and Gertrude is the goalie.

* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve goes to the left wing, and Alice goes to cheering.
* **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice goes to the left wing, and Fred goes to cheering.
* **Alice and Gertrude switch:** Alice becomes the goalie, and Gertrude becomes the left wing.
* **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob becomes the cheerleader, and Eve becomes the left wing.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the left wing.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve becomes the striker, and Claire becomes the left wing.
* **Alice and Dave switch:** Alice becomes the center midfielder, and Dave becomes the left wing.

So, Claire is now on the right wing! 

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Alice and Bob switched partners, then Eve and Gertrude switched partners, and so on.  Let's see who they all end up with! 

* **Alice** started with Karl, then she switched with Bob. 
* **Bob** started with Izzi, then he switched with Alice. 
* **Eve** started with Rodrigo, then she switched with Gertrude. 
* **Gertrude** started with Patrick, then she switched with Izzi. 
* **Claire** started with Melissa, then she switched with Gertrude. 
* **Fred** started with Helga, then he switched with Gertrude. 
* **Dave** started with Lola, then he switched with Claire. 

So, who did Alice end up with? 


**Answer: (F) Karl**

* **(D) Izzi**
* **(E) Melissa**
* **(F) Sam**

* **Eve and Fred:** Eve had Catch-22, Fred had The Fellowship of the Ring.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** Bob had Ulysses, Gertrude had The Odyssey.

Now, we need to figure out who has The Odyssey at the end.  

**The answer is (F) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  We don't know what they swapped, but we know their gifts are now in a different place.

* **Dave and Fred:** They switch books.

* **Fred and Claire:** They switch books.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** They switch books.

So, who gets the book at the end?  Let's look at the last swap.  

**The answer is (E) The Odyssey.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Fred and Bob trade balls. Then Eve and Fred trade balls.  Then Dave and Eve trade balls.  It looks like they keep trading!  

Finally, Alice and Bob trade balls.  Then Dave and Fred trade balls.  And then Bob and Claire trade balls.  And last, Gertrude and Alice trade balls.

So, who has the ball at the end?  It's Alice! 


**Answer: (C)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out where Dave is playing!

* **Start:** Dave is the goalkeeper.
* Bob is the left midfielder.
* Claire is the right winger.
* Alice is the left winger.
* Eve is the right midfielder.
* Fred is the benchwarmer.
* Gertrude is the center midfielder.

Now, let's see what happens:

* Bob and Fred switch places.
* Bob and Dave switch places.
* Gertrude and Eve switch places.
* Bob and Dave switch places again.
* Gertrude and Dave switch places.
* Eve and Alice switch places.
* Alice and Claire switch places.

So, Dave is now playing the center midfielder! 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means they traded their gifts.
* **Eve and Fred swap:**  They also traded their gifts.

* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They traded their gifts.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  They traded their gifts.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  They traded their gifts.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:**  They traded their gifts.

We don't know who has what after each swap.  We can't figure out who has what just by looking at the swaps. 



**So the answer is none of the above.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Gertrude started with Lola. Then Fred and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Dave and Claire switched partners.  Then Dave and Bob switched partners.  Then Bob and Claire switched partners.  Then Alice and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Dave and Alice switched partners.  Finally, Eve and Gertrude switched partners. 

So, who is Gertrude dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:**  (E) Jamie 
"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Dave is in the right midfielder spot.  
* **Fred and Gertrude trade:** Fred moves to the back, and Gertrude moves to the left.
* **Dave and Gertrude trade:** Dave moves to the back, and Gertrude moves to the right.
* **Gertrude and Fred trade:** Gertrude moves to the left, and Fred moves to the back.
* **Alice and Bob trade:** Alice moves to the back, and Bob moves to the left.

* **Eve and Claire trade:** Eve moves to the right, and Claire moves to the back.
* **Alice and Gertrude trade:** Alice moves to the right, and Gertrude moves to the left.

So, Dave is now in the right winger spot! 

**Answer:** (G) 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  Alice has a white gift, Bob has a yellow gift, Claire has a red gift, Dave has a black ball, Eve has a pink ball, Fred has an orange ball, and Gertrude has a purple gift.

* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gives her white gift to Eve, who gets a pink ball. 
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve gives her pink ball to Fred, who gets an orange ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gives her white gift to Bob, who gets a yellow gift.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gives her red gift to Dave, who gets a black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gives her pink ball to Claire, who gets a red gift.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gives his yellow gift to Gertrude, who gets a purple gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gives her orange ball to Alice, who gets a white gift.

So, Alice ends up with the white gift! 

**The answer is (A).**

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** They swap balls.
* **Fred and Claire:** They swap balls.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap balls.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** They swap balls again.
* **Alice and Claire:** They swap balls.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap balls again.
* **Eve and Claire:** They swap balls.

So, who ends up with Claire's ball?  It's Gertrude! 


The answer is **(D) yellow ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:** Fred is on the left wing.
* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob goes to the bench, and Alice goes to the right wing.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave goes to the left wing, and Eve goes to cheering.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch:** Gertrude goes to the left wing, and Eve goes to the striker.
* **Fred and Bob switch:** Fred goes to the left wing, and Bob goes to the right wing.
* **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire goes to the left wing, and Fred goes to the left midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch:** Gertrude goes to the left midfielder, and Alice goes to the striker.
* **Dave and Fred switch:** Dave goes to the left midfielder, and Fred goes to the left wing.

So, Fred is now playing the left wing! 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the colors of the balls!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Claire and Dave:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Eve and Fred:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire:** They swap, so they each get a different color ball.

Now, think about who has the ball that is the same color as Bob. 

**The answer is (B) green ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Bob is the goalkeeper.  Claire is the center midfielder. Dave is the right midfielder. Eve is the fullback. Fred is the left midfielder. Gertrude is the cheerleader.

* **Gertrude and Eve switch:**  Gertrude and Eve switch places. 
* **Gertrude and Alice switch:** Gertrude and Alice switch places.
* **Eve and Claire switch:** Eve and Claire switch places.
* **Fred and Eve switch:** Fred and Eve switch places.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch:** Claire and Gertrude switch places.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire and Dave switch places.
* **Fred and Bob switch:** Fred and Bob switch places.

Now, who is Bob playing? 

**The answer is (A) goalkeeper.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone is swapping gifts.  Let's think about what happens when they swap. 

* **Alice and Fred swap:**  This means Fred gets Alice's present, and Alice gets Fred's present. 
* **Claire and Bob swap:** This means Bob gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Bob's present. 
* **Dave and Fred swap:** This means Fred gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Fred's present. 
* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Alice's present. 
* **Bob and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Alice's present. 
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This means Gertrude gets Eve's present, and Eve gets Gertrude's present. 
* **Fred and Alice swap:** This means Alice gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Alice's present. 

So, the final gift is the one that was in Fred's hand at the end. 

**The answer is (E) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

We know Fred is with Sam at the start. Then, Claire and Fred switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Eve switch partners.  Then, Dave and Claire switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Eve switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Eve switch partners. 

So, who is Fred dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:**  Fred is dancing with Sam. 
 
**So the answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know Gertrude starts with Karl. Then, Eve and Claire switch partners.  Then, Dave and Fred switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners again.  Gertrude and Eve switch partners.  Alice and Bob switch partners.  Dave and Eve switch partners again.  Finally, Fred and Gertrude switch partners. 

So, who is Gertrude dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:**  Gertrude is dancing with Karl.

"Okay, let's think about this like a game!

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Trading:**  They trade books with each other.

Let's see who gets what book at the end:

1. **Eve and Claire swap:**  This doesn't change who has which book.
2. **Fred and Claire swap:** Fred gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Fred's book.
3. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
4. **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Alice's book.
5. **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Claire's book.
6. **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Bob's book.
7. **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Eve's book.

**The last step is important!**  Dave had The Odyssey at the start.  Claire and Dave swapped books, so Dave now has the book Claire had. 

**The answer is (G) The Odyssey.**

"Okay, let's see! 

We know Alice got Ulysses, Bob got The Great Gatsby, Claire got The Fellowship of the Ring, Dave got The Pearl, Eve got Hound of the Baskervilles, Fred got Lolita, and Gertrude got Catch-22. 

Then, they traded books.  

* Bob and Claire traded books.
* Dave and Bob traded books.
* Claire and Fred traded books.
* Claire and Dave traded books.
* Fred and Eve traded books.
* Alice and Dave traded books.
* Fred and Gertrude traded books.

Now, let's see who has which book at the end. 


**Which book does Alice have at the end?**

(A) Hound of the Baskervilles
(B) Lolita
(C) The Great Gatsby
(D) The Pearl
(E) Catch-22
(F) Ulysses
(G) The Fellowship of the Ring 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Alice** traded with **Claire** and **Eve**.
* **Claire** traded with **Dave** and **Bob**.
* **Bob** traded with **Dave** and **Eve**.
* **Eve** traded with **Alice**.

So, Dave must have gotten Catch-22 from someone else. 


The answer is **(B) Catch-22**.

* Fred and Gertrude swap.
* Gertrude and Bob swap.
* Fred and Claire swap.
* Claire and Dave swap.
* Claire and Eve swap.
* Alice and Bob swap.
* Claire and Eve swap again.

So, who ends up with the ball that was originally Claire's?

We know Gertrude starts with Patrick. Then, Alice and Eve switch partners.  Then, Dave and Fred switch partners.  Eve and Claire switch partners.  Dave and Gertrude switch partners.  Dave and Bob switch partners.  Alice and Claire switch partners.  Finally, Eve and Gertrude switch partners. 

Who is Gertrude dancing with at the end? 

a) Izzi
b) Helga
c) Sam
d) Karl
e) Patrick
f) Lola
g) Melissa

Eve and Alice switch partners, so Eve is now with Izzi.  Dave and Bob switch partners, so Dave is now with Ophelia.  Dave and Eve switch partners, so Dave is now with Izzi.  Finally, Alice and Dave switch partners, so Alice is now with Rodrigo. 

So, Eve is dancing with Izzi! 


The answer is **(G)**. 
"
"Okay, let's see! 

We need to figure out who has the white ball at the end.  

* **Dave and Alice:**  Dave starts with a green ball, Alice starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Alice gets the green ball.
* **Alice and Fred:** Alice now has the pink ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the pink ball and Alice gets the black ball.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred now has the pink ball, Dave has the black ball. They swap, so Dave gets the pink ball and Fred gets the black ball.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve now has the blue ball, Bob has the orange ball. They swap, so Bob gets the blue ball and Eve gets the orange ball.
* **Claire and Fred:** Claire now has the white ball, Fred has the black ball. They swap, so Fred gets the white ball and Claire gets the black ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** Bob now has the orange ball, Gertrude has the yellow ball. They swap, so Gertrude gets the orange ball and Bob gets the yellow ball.
* **Gertrude and Alice:** Gertrude now has the yellow ball, Alice has the black ball. They swap, so Alice gets the yellow ball and Gertrude gets the black ball.

3. Alice and Claire swap books.
4. Claire and Bob swap books.
5. Eve and Claire swap books.
6. Fred and Alice swap books.

"
"Okay, let's figure out where Gertrude is playing!

* **Start:**  Alice is the striker, Bob is the goalkeeper, Claire is the left winger, Dave is the benchwarmer, Eve is the center midfielder, Fred is the fullback, and Gertrude is the cheerleader.

* **Alice and Fred switch:** Alice becomes the fullback, and Fred becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch:** Claire becomes the fullback, and Gertrude becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Dave becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the benchwarmer.
* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob becomes the center midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the center midfielder.

"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Alice starts as a right winger.**
* **Then, Dave and Alice switch places.**  Dave becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the left midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob switch places.** Claire becomes the right midfielder, and Bob becomes the fullback.
* **Fred and Dave switch places.** Fred becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the goalkeeper.
* **Eve and Bob switch places.** Eve becomes the right midfielder, and Bob becomes the left midfielder.
* **Dave and Gertrude switch places.** Dave becomes the left winger, and Gertrude becomes the right midfielder.
* **Alice and Dave switch places.** Alice becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Claire and Eve switch places.** Claire becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the right midfielder.

So, Eve is now playing the right midfielder! 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

6. **Bob and Eve:** Bob's green ball and Eve's red ball are swapped.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude's purple ball and Claire's yellow ball are swapped.

**The Final Ball:**  Fred doesn't trade with anyone in the last round. 

**So, Fred has the purple ball!**

**Answer: (G)**

* **Eve and Gertrude** swap books.
* **Dave and Bob** swap books.
* **Fred and Eve** swap books.
* **Bob and Fred** swap books.

It's like a big circle of trading!  

Now, we need to figure out who has the book at the end.  Let's think about who got what book at the start.

* **Bob** got *Ulysses* to start.
* **Dave** got *The Odyssey* to start.
* **Alice** got *Frankenstein* to start.

**So, we can't figure out who has what present!**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone is dancing with someone else at the start.  Then, some people switch partners.  Let's see who switches with whom:

* Gertrude and Alice switch partners.
* Dave and Claire switch partners.
* Bob and Claire switch partners.
* Gertrude and Eve switch partners.
* Claire and Fred switch partners.
* Fred and Alice switch partners.
* Gertrude and Dave switch partners.

Now, we need to figure out who is dancing with who at the end.  Let's look at the last step: Gertrude and Dave switch partners. 

**So, Eve is dancing with...**

(A) Ophelia
(B) Izzi
(C) Melissa
(D) Jamie
(E) Sam
(F) Rodrigo
(G) Lola 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:** Alice has blue, Bob has red, Claire has orange, Dave has brown, Eve has black, Fred has yellow, and Gertrude has purple.

* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  Fred gets purple, and Gertrude gets yellow.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets black, and Eve gets yellow.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets orange, and Claire gets brown.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets purple, and Gertrude gets orange.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets black, and Eve gets brown.
* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice gets yellow, and Fred gets blue.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets red, and Bob gets blue.

Now, who has the blue present? 

**Answer: (G)** 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

First, we know Claire and Dave traded balls.  Then Fred and Eve did too.  Then Bob and Claire swapped.  Eve and Alice swapped, and then Eve and Gertrude swapped.  Finally, Bob and Dave swapped again. 

Now, let's think about who has the ball that Claire didn't swap.  

**The answer is (G) brown ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve and Claire switched partners, then Fred and Gertrude switched partners.  Then Eve and Bob switched partners.  Eve and Alice switched partners.  Then Dave and Bob switched partners.  Then Dave and Eve switched partners.  Finally, Alice and Dave switched partners. 

So, who is Alice dancing with at the end? 

* **(A) Rodrigo** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred is dancing with Lola at the start. Then, Dave and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Bob switch partners.  Then, Eve and Bob switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Bob switch partners.  Then, Claire and Dave switch partners.  Then, Alice and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Fred switch partners. 

So, who is Fred dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Sam**
* **(B) Rodrigo**
* **(C) Lola**
* **(D) Karl**
* **(E) Izzi**
* **(F) Melissa**
* **(G) Patrick** 


 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Let's see what happens when they swap gifts:

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This doesn't change anything, they just switch colors.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is Fred's.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** This changes the colors.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** This changes the colors.

Now, we need to think about what color Gertrude has at the end.  

**The answer is (E) purple present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners.  Let's look at the changes:

1. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**
2. **Fred and Alice switch partners.**
3. **Bob and Dave switch partners.**
4. **Alice and Bob switch partners.**
5. **Alice and Eve switch partners.**
6. **Alice and Dave switch partners.**
7. **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**

Now, we need to figure out who Claire is dancing with at the end.  

**The answer is (B) Jamie.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, people swap gifts with each other.  

Here's what we need to figure out:

* **Who has what gift at the end?**

We need to think about how each swap changes the gifts.  

Let's look at the swaps:

1. Gertrude and Dave swap gifts.
2. Fred and Eve swap gifts.
3. Bob and Fred swap gifts.
4. Alice and Dave swap gifts.
5. Claire and Alice swap gifts.

"Okay, let's think about this like a game!

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Alice and Eve:** They trade books.
* **Bob and Alice:** They trade books.
* **Dave and Eve:** They trade books.
* **Alice and Fred:** They trade books.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** They trade books.
* **Gertrude and Fred:** They trade books.
* **Fred and Claire:** They trade books.

Now, we need to figure out who has the book at the end.  

**The answer is (F) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Claire starts with Patrick.  Then, Fred and Alice switch partners.  Then, Eve and Gertrude switch partners.  Then, Claire and Eve switch partners again.  Then, Fred and Dave switch partners.  Then, Claire and Alice switch partners.  Then, Fred and Gertrude switch partners.  Finally, Bob and Claire switch partners.

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end? 

* **(A) Melissa**
* **(B) Patrick**
* **(C) Ophelia**
* **(D) Rodrigo**

"Okay, let's think about this like a game!

We know that everyone got a new book at the start. Then, they traded books with each other.  

* Eve and Claire traded books, but that doesn't change who has which book.
* Fred and Claire traded books, and then Bob and Gertrude traded books. 
* Alice and Fred traded books, and then Claire and Dave traded books. 
* Bob and Gertrude traded books again.
* Finally, Eve and Bob traded books.

So, who has the book at the end?  Let's look at the last swap. Bob and Eve traded books. Bob got Eve's book, and Eve got Bob's book. 

**The answer is (A) The Pearl.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with someone else.  

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  This means they traded their gifts.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  They also traded gifts.
* **Dave and Alice swap:**  They traded gifts.
* **Bob and Claire swap:**  They traded gifts.
* **Fred and Eve swap:**  They traded gifts again.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  They traded gifts again.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  They traded gifts.

Now, we need to figure out who has the gift at the end. 


**The answer is (E) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Alice is playing at the end of the game!

* **Alice starts:** She's the right midfielder.
* **Dave and Eve switch:**  Dave becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the fullback.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch:** Claire becomes the striker, and Gertrude becomes the center midfielder.
* **Fred and Dave switch:** Fred becomes the fullback, and Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire becomes the right winger, and Dave becomes the center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Claire switch:** Gertrude becomes the center midfielder, and Claire becomes the striker.

So, at the end of the game, Alice is playing the **left winger**! 


 
"
"Okay, let's figure out where Bob is at the end!

* **Start:**  Bob is the cheerleader.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:**  Gertrude is now the fullback, and Claire is now the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice is now the striker, and Eve is now the left midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire is now the right midfielder, and Bob is now the fullback.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve is now the goalkeeper, and Dave is now the striker.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire is now the left midfielder, and Gertrude is now the striker.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave is now the left midfielder, and Gertrude is now the goalkeeper.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred is now the striker, and Eve is now the left midfielder.

So, Bob is now the **fullback**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, they trade balls with each other.  

* Alice and Fred swap, so Fred gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Fred's ball.
* Gertrude and Fred swap, so Fred gets Gertrude's ball and Gertrude gets Fred's ball.
* Bob and Dave swap, so Dave gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Dave's ball.
* Alice and Bob swap, so Bob gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Bob's ball.
* Claire and Fred swap, so Fred gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Fred's ball.
* Claire and Gertrude swap, so Gertrude gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Gertrude's ball.
* Alice and Eve swap, so Eve gets Alice's ball and Alice gets Eve's ball.

Fred ends up with the green ball! 


**The answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's look at the dance moves!

* **Start:**  Bob is with Ophelia, Claire is with Lola, Dave is with Rodrigo, Eve is with Jamie, Fred is with Sam, and Gertrude is with Karl.

* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice and Bob switch partners.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire and Eve switch partners.
* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave and Claire switch partners.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that at the start, Claire is dancing with Jamie.  Then, Dave and Bob switch partners.  Eve and Claire switch partners.  Then, Alice and Eve switch partners.  Gertrude and Alice switch partners.  Eve and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Gertrude and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Claire dancing with at the end? 


* **(A) Sam**
* **(B) Rodrigo**
* **(C) Patrick**
* **(D) Ophelia**
* **(E) Jamie**
* **(F) Karl**
* **(G) Helga** 



 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the book at the end!

* **Claire** gets *The Great Gatsby*.
* **Dave** gets *The Odyssey*.
* **Eve** gets *Ulysses*.

* **Dave and Claire** swap books.
* **Alice and Bob** swap books.
* **Eve and Claire** swap books.
* **Alice and Gertrude** swap books.

So, who has the book that was originally owned by Alice? 

**The answer is (F) Hound of the Baskervilles.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:** Alice has a green present, Bob has an orange ball, Claire has a black ball, Dave has a blue present, Eve has a pink ball, Fred has a purple present, and Gertrude has a yellow present.

* **Fred and Dave swap:**  They swap gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  They swap gifts, but we don't know what they got.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  This changes Alice's present.
* **Eve and Bob swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This changes Alice's present.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  This doesn't change the colors.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This changes Alice's present.

So, the last person to swap gifts is Alice.  She must have the black ball!

**Answer: (E)** 



"

So, we can't know who has which book at the end.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a partner.  Then, some people switch partners.  Let's see who switches with whom:

* **Bob and Fred switch partners.**  
* **Claire and Alice switch partners.**
* **Claire and Dave switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
* **Claire and Bob switch partners.**
* **Dave and Fred switch partners.**
* **Eve and Alice switch partners.**

Now, we need to figure out who Claire is dancing with at the end.  

The answer is **(A) Sam.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:** Alice has a white present, Bob has an orange ball, Claire has a black ball, Dave has a pink ball, Eve has a purple present, Fred has a green present, and Gertrude has a brown present.

* **Fred and Eve swap:**  Fred gets purple, and Eve gets green.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets pink, and Dave gets orange.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gets white, and Alice gets pink.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets black, and Claire gets orange.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets green, and Eve gets purple.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave gets brown, and Claire gets black.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** Fred gets brown, and Gertrude gets green.

Now, look at the end. Alice has the **orange ball**. 


**Answer:** (F) orange ball. 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

We know Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books with each other. 

Let's think about who got which book at the end. 

* **Alice** got a book from **Eve** and then traded with **Fred**. 
* **Bob** got a book from **Dave** and then traded with **Dave**. 
* **Claire** got a book from **Eve** and then traded with **Dave**. 
* **Dave** got a book from **Gertrude** and then traded with **Eve**. 
* **Gertrude** got a book from **Dave** and then traded with **Eve**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Let's see what happens when they swap gifts:

* **Alice and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts again.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Dave and Bob swap:**  They switch gifts.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  They switch gifts again.

Now, think about who might have the gift that is left! 


**The answer is (E) black ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Gertrude is at the end!

* **Start:**  Alice is on the left, Bob is on the back, Claire is in the middle, Dave is on the right, Eve is sitting on the bench, Fred is cheering, and Gertrude is in the left middle.

* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice goes to the back, Bob goes to the left.

* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave goes to the bench, Eve goes to the right.

* **Fred and Bob switch:** Fred goes to the middle, Bob goes to the back.

* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice goes to the right, Eve goes to the left.

* **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire goes to the back, Fred goes to the middle.

* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire goes to the right, Bob goes to the left.

* **Bob and Gertrude switch:** Bob goes to the left, Gertrude goes to the back.

**So, Gertrude is now on the back!** 


**Answer: (G) Fullback** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

* **Start:**  Alice is in the middle, Bob is up front, Claire is on the left, Dave is cheering, Eve is at the back, Fred is on the right, and Gertrude is sitting on the bench.

* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice goes to the left, and Claire goes to the middle.
* **Gertrude and Bob switch:** Gertrude goes up front, and Bob goes to the back.
* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve goes to the middle, and Alice goes to the back.
* **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire goes to the right, and Fred goes to the middle.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude goes to cheer, and Dave goes to the back.
* **Eve and Fred switch:** Eve goes to the right, and Fred goes to the middle.
* **Fred and Bob switch:** Fred goes up front, and Bob goes to the right.

Now, let's see who's where!

* **Alice:** Back
* **Bob:** Right
* **Claire:** Right
* **Dave:** Cheerleader
* **Eve:** Middle
* **Fred:** Up front
* **Gertrude:** Benchwarmer 


**Answer:** (F) right winger 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know Alice has a yellow ball, Bob has a red ball, Claire has a black ball, Dave has a white ball, Eve has a blue ball, Fred has a green ball, and Gertrude has a brown ball.

Then, Alice and Fred swap balls.  Fred gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Fred's green ball.

Then, Gertrude and Fred swap balls. Fred gets Gertrude's brown ball and Gertrude gets Fred's green ball.

Then, Bob and Dave swap balls. Dave gets Bob's red ball and Bob gets Dave's white ball.

Then, Alice and Bob swap balls. Bob gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Bob's red ball.

Then, Claire and Fred swap balls. Fred gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Fred's green ball.

Then, Claire and Gertrude swap balls. Gertrude gets Claire's black ball and Claire gets Gertrude's brown ball.

Finally, Alice and Eve swap balls. Eve gets Alice's yellow ball and Alice gets Eve's blue ball.

So, Eve has the blue ball! 

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Fred is in the middle, Alice is cheering, Bob is on the right, Claire is in the back, Dave is the striker, Eve is on the bench, and Gertrude is on the left.

* **Alice and Gertrude switch:**  Alice goes to the left, and Gertrude goes to cheerleading.

* **Dave and Claire switch:** Dave goes to the left, and Claire goes to the back.

* **Bob and Fred switch:** Bob goes to the front, and Fred goes to the middle.

* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred goes to cheerleading, and Alice goes to the middle.

* **Gertrude and Fred switch:** Gertrude goes to the front, and Fred goes to the left.

* **Dave and Bob switch:** Dave goes to the right, and Bob goes to the front.

* **Claire and Eve switch:** Claire goes to the bench, and Eve goes to the back.

**So, Fred is now on the left!** 

The answer is (G). 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who has the book at the end!

* **Fred and Dave:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve got a book Fred traded.
* **Gertrude and Bob:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Alice and Bob:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Eve and Bob:** Eve got a book Bob traded.
* **Dave and Alice:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.
* **Fred and Claire:** They traded books, so they both had a book they traded.

It looks like they traded books in a circle!  So, let's see who has the book at the end. 

**The answer is (E) Ulysses.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Eve starts:** Eve is a left midfielder.
* **Bob and Alice switch:** Bob becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave becomes the left winger, and Eve becomes the cheerleader.
* **Gertrude and Eve switch:** Gertrude becomes the cheerleader, and Eve becomes the left midfielder.
* **Fred and Bob switch:** Fred becomes the left winger, and Bob becomes the striker.
* **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire becomes the left winger, and Fred becomes the left midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch:** Gertrude becomes the left midfielder, and Alice becomes the striker.
* **Dave and Fred switch:** Dave becomes the left midfielder, and Fred becomes the striker.

So, Eve is still the left midfielder! 

The answer is **(D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Fred and Gertrude started dancing together. Then, Eve and Claire switched partners.  Then, Dave and Fred switched partners.  Alice and Claire switched partners.  Gertrude and Eve switched partners again.  Alice and Bob switched partners.  Dave and Eve switched partners again.  Finally, Fred and Gertrude switched partners. 

So, Fred is now dancing with Gertrude. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Fred and Bob switched partners, then Gertrude and Eve switched partners.  Then, Fred and Bob switched partners again.  

After that, Claire and Fred switched partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switched partners.  Finally, Claire and Bob switched partners again. 

So, who is Fred dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** Izzi 
 
 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.

So, to find out who Alice is dancing with, we need to look at who is dancing with whom at the end.

"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, people trade their balls with other people.  

* Fred and Eve swap, so Eve gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Eve's ball.
* Claire and Bob swap, so Bob gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Bob's ball.
* Fred and Bob swap, so Bob gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Bob's ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so Alice gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Alice's ball.
* Bob and Gertrude swap, so Gertrude gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Gertrude's ball.
* Bob and Claire swap, so Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.

Now, look at the end.  Who has the yellow ball? 


**Answer: (D) yellow ball** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

* **First swap:**  Gertrude and Alice swap.
* **Second swap:**  Dave and Eve swap.
* **Third swap:**  Alice and Dave swap.
* **Fourth swap:**  Fred and Dave swap.
* **Fifth swap:**  Bob and Dave swap.
* **Sixth swap:**  Claire and Gertrude swap.
* **Seventh swap:**  Gertrude and Dave swap.

So, we need to figure out what Eve's present is at the end.  

**The answer is (A) brown present.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a partner.  Then, some people switch partners.  Let's see who switches with whom:

* **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
* **Bob and Alice switch partners.**
* **Eve and Gertrude switch partners.**
* **Fred and Claire switch partners.**
* **Fred and Bob switch partners.**
* **Dave and Fred switch partners.**

Now, let's look at who is dancing with who at the end.  

**Bob is dancing with Patrick.** 

So the answer is **(D)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Then, they swap gifts with other people.  

* **Fred and Alice:** Fred gets Alice's gift, and Alice gets Fred's gift.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gets Claire's gift, and Claire gets Fred's gift.
* **Dave and Bob:** Dave gets Eve's gift, and Bob gets Dave's gift.
* **Fred and Dave:** Fred gets Claire's gift, and Dave gets Fred's gift.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude gets Bob's gift, and Eve gets Gertrude's gift.
* **Fred and Eve:** Fred gets Claire's gift, and Eve gets Fred's gift.
* **Claire and Bob:** Claire gets Dave's gift, and Bob gets Claire's gift.

Now, let's look at the last swap. Fred and Eve swap gifts.  Eve gets Fred's gift, and Fred gets Eve's gift. 

So, Eve gets Fred's gift, which is the pink ball. 

**Answer:** (E) 



"
"Let's think about the books! 

* **At the start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  They trade books, but it doesn't change who has which book.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  They trade books, but it doesn't change who has which book.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** They trade books, but it doesn't change who has which book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** They trade books, but it doesn't change who has which book.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** They trade books, but it doesn't change who has which book.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** They trade books, but it doesn't change who has which book.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** They trade books, but it doesn't change who has which book.

So, Dave started with Moby Dick, and he still has it at the end! 

**The answer is (E) Moby Dick.** 



"
"Okay, let's see!  

We need to figure out who has the ball at the end.  

* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets Alice's blue ball, and Alice gets Fred's pink ball.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets Gertrude's green ball, and Gertrude gets Claire's brown ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob gets Dave's purple ball, and Dave gets Bob's red ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's blue ball, and Alice gets Eve's black ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's red ball, and Bob gets Claire's brown ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave gets Eve's black ball, and Eve gets Dave's purple ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's red ball, and Bob gets Claire's brown ball.

So, at the end, Claire has the brown ball. 

**Answer:** (D) 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Gertrude and Alice:**  Gertrude gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Gertrude her ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** Fred gives Bob his ball, and Bob gives Fred his ball.
* **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire his ball, and Claire gives Fred his ball.
* **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave her ball, and Dave gives Eve her ball.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice gives Eve her ball, and Eve gives Alice her ball.
* **Alice and Claire:** Alice gives Claire her ball, and Claire gives Alice her ball.

So, at the end of the game, Claire has the ball that was originally Alice's. 

The answer is **(A) purple ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's see!  

We know that Alice and Bob switched partners, then Eve and Alice switched partners, and then Fred and Eve switched partners.  

Let's look at the list of partners:

* Alice is with Rodrigo
* Bob is with Gertrude
* Eve is with Patrick
* Fred is with Jamie
* Dave is with Helga
* Claire is with Sam
* Lola is with Alice


So the answer is **(B) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Let's see who gets what after the swaps:

1. **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  This means Eve now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Eve's present.
2. **Gertrude and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Bob's present.
3. **Gertrude and Fred swap:** This means Fred now has Gertrude's present, and Gertrude now has Fred's present.
4. **Bob and Dave swap:** This means Dave now has Bob's present, and Bob now has Dave's present.
5. **Alice and Bob swap:** This means Bob now has Alice's present, and Alice now has Bob's present.
6. **Dave and Claire swap:** This means Claire now has Dave's present, and Dave now has Claire's present.
7. **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Alice now has Claire's present, and Claire now has Alice's present.

Now, let's think about who has the blue present.

"Okay, let's think about this like a game!

First, we know everyone got a new book at the start.  Then, they trade books with each other.  

* Alice and Bob swap books.
* Gertrude and Claire swap books.
* Dave and Gertrude swap books.
* Alice and Fred swap books.
* Dave and Eve swap books.
* Claire and Bob swap books.
* Eve and Bob swap books.

It's like a big puzzle!  We need to figure out who has the book that was originally owned by Gertrude. 

The final swap is between Eve and Bob.  So, the book that was originally owned by Gertrude is now with Eve. 

The answer is **(E) Frankenstein**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Fred is playing!

* **Start:**  Alice is the left midfielder, Bob is the striker, Claire is the benchwarmer, Dave is the center midfielder, Eve is the cheerleader, Fred is the left winger, and Gertrude is the fullback.

* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice and Dave switch places.
* **Alice and Claire trade:** Alice and Claire switch places.
* **Alice and Dave trade:** Alice and Dave switch places again.
* **Claire and Fred trade:** Claire and Fred switch places.
* **Dave and Eve trade:** Dave and Eve switch places.
* **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude and Bob switch places.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude and Dave switch places again.

So, Fred is now the left winger! 

**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone got a new book at the start of the semester.  Then, they traded books with each other.  

* Eve and Bob traded books.
* Dave and Gertrude traded books.
* Bob and Dave traded books.
* Bob and Claire traded books.
* Fred and Claire traded books.
* Alice and Claire traded books.
* Claire and Dave traded books.

Let's see... who ends up with what book at the end? 


**The answer is (B) The Great Gatsby.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps!

* **First:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Then:**  Claire and Gertrude trade books.
* **Next:** Fred and Dave trade books.
* **After that:** Bob and Alice trade books.
* **Then:** Eve and Gertrude trade books.
* **After that:** Dave and Bob trade books.
* **Finally:** Fred and Eve trade books.
* **Last:** Bob and Fred trade books.

Now, who has the book at the end?  Let's look at the swaps to figure it out! 


**Answer: (D) Moby Dick** 
"
"Okay, let's figure out what Fred has!

* **Start:**  Fred has a brown present.
* **Alice and Fred swap:**  Fred gets Alice's blue present, and Alice gets Fred's brown present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:**  Bob gets Claire's red present, and Claire gets Bob's yellow present.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  Fred gets Dave's black ball, and Dave gets Fred's brown present.
* **Eve and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Eve's white present, and Eve gets Alice's blue present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  Alice gets Bob's yellow present, and Bob gets Alice's blue present.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Gertrude gets Eve's white present, and Eve gets Gertrude's orange present.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Fred gets Alice's blue present, and Alice gets Fred's brown present.

So, Fred has the **brown present**!

"Okay, let's think about this!

We know that everyone got a new book at the start. Then, they traded books with each other.  

* **Gertrude and Bob:**  They traded books, but it doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Eve and Bob:** They also traded books, but it doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** They traded books, but it doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Fred and Claire:** They traded books, but it doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Claire and Alice:** They traded books, but it doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Bob and Dave:** They traded books again, but it doesn't change Dave's book.
* **Eve and Fred:** They traded books, but it doesn't change Dave's book.

So, Dave still has the book he got at the start! 

The answer is **(B) The Pearl**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the balls!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Fred and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Eve's ball.
* **Claire and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Claire's ball and Claire gets Bob's ball.
* **Fred and Bob:** They swap, so Bob gets Fred's ball and Fred gets Bob's ball.
* **Eve and Alice:** They swap, so Alice gets Eve's ball and Eve gets Alice's ball.
* **Bob and Gertrude:** They swap, so Gertrude gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Gertrude's ball.
* **Bob and Claire:** They swap, so Claire gets Bob's ball and Bob gets Claire's ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** They swap, so Eve gets Dave's ball and Dave gets Eve's ball.

Now, look at the end.  Alice has the **(C) white ball**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Fred is playing!

* **Start:** Fred is the cheerleader.
* **Gertrude and Bob trade:** Gertrude is now the goalkeeper, and Bob is the cheerleader.
* **Eve and Alice trade:** Eve is now the cheerleader, and Alice is the striker.
* **Gertrude and Dave trade:** Gertrude is now the left midfielder, and Dave is the goalkeeper.
* **Dave and Fred trade:** Dave is now the cheerleader, and Fred is the left midfielder.
* **Claire and Eve trade:** Claire is now the striker, and Eve is the left midfielder.
* **Fred and Gertrude trade:** Fred is now the striker, and Gertrude is the left midfielder.

So, Fred is now the left midfielder! 

The answer is **(D) left midfielder**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Trading:**  People trade their balls with each other.

Let's see who gets which ball after trading:

1. **Alice and Fred:** Alice gives Fred her blue ball, and Fred gets Alice's blue ball.
2. **Dave and Fred:** Dave gives Fred his brown ball, and Fred gets Dave's brown ball.
3. **Eve and Gertrude:** Eve gives Gertrude her pink ball, and Gertrude gets Eve's pink ball.
4. **Dave and Claire:** Dave gives Claire her brown ball, and Claire gets Dave's brown ball.
5. **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob her black ball, and Bob gets Claire's black ball.
6. **Dave and Alice:** Dave gives Alice her blue ball, and Alice gets Dave's blue ball.
7. **Bob and Fred:** Bob gives Fred his orange ball, and Fred gets Bob's orange ball.

**The last person:**  Dave is the only one who didn't trade his ball.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone got a new book at the start of the semester. Then, they traded books with each other.  

* **Gertrude and Fred swap:**  This means they both started with different books.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:**  This means Dave started with a different book than Gertrude.
* **Dave and Claire swap:**  This means Dave started with a different book than Claire.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  This means Alice and Bob started with different books.
* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Eve and Claire started with different books.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:**  This means Alice and Gertrude started with different books.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob and Alice started with different books.

So, we need to figure out who started with which book. 

**The answer is (E) Ulysses.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Alice is the striker, Bob is the cheerleader, Claire is the fullback, Dave is the benchwarmer, Eve is the left winger, Fred is the center midfielder, and Gertrude is the right winger.

* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Bob switch:** Alice becomes the cheerleader, and Bob becomes the striker.
* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Dave switch:** Gertrude becomes the benchwarmer, and Dave becomes the right winger.
* **Alice and Eve switch:** Alice becomes the right winger, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Bob switch:** Claire becomes the center midfielder, and Bob becomes the right winger.
* **Fred and Alice switch:** Fred becomes the right winger, and Alice becomes the center midfielder.

So, Claire is now the center midfielder! 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about who is dancing with who!

* **Dave and Bob switch partners:**  Dave is now with Ophelia.
* **Eve and Claire switch partners:** Eve and Claire are now dancing with each other.
* **Claire and Gertrude switch partners:** Claire and Gertrude are now dancing with each other.
* **Alice and Eve switch partners:** Alice and Eve are now dancing with each other.
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners:** Gertrude and Alice are now dancing with each other.
* **Eve and Fred switch partners:** Eve and Fred are now dancing with each other.
* **Gertrude and Claire switch partners:** Gertrude and Claire are now dancing with each other.

So, at the end of the dance, Dave is dancing with Ophelia. 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Eve and Gertrude swap balls. Then, Dave and Alice swap balls.  Then, Fred and Dave swap balls.  And so on.  

Let's see... who gets the yellow ball? 


**Answer:** (E) yellow ball 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, everyone has a partner.  Then, some people switch partners.  Let's see who switches with whom:

* **Bob and Dave switch partners.**  
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners.**
* **Fred and Bob switch partners.**
* **Eve and Bob switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Alice switch partners.**
* **Fred and Claire switch partners.**
* **Claire and Eve switch partners.**

Now, let's think about who is dancing with who at the end.  

**The answer is (C) Ophelia.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color gift.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice's white gift becomes Eve's pink gift.
* **Eve and Fred swap:** Eve's pink gift becomes Fred's orange gift.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice's white gift becomes Bob's yellow gift.
* **Claire and Dave swap:** Claire's red gift becomes Dave's black ball.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve's pink gift becomes Claire's red gift.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob's yellow gift becomes Gertrude's purple gift.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve's orange gift becomes Alice's white gift.

Now, let's see who has the red gift! 

**The answer is (A) red present.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the swaps!

Eve and Gertrude traded books first, so Eve now has Gertrude's book. Then Bob and Eve traded books, so Bob now has Eve's book.  Alice and Gertrude also traded books, so Alice now has Gertrude's book. 

Claire and Eve traded books, so Claire now has Eve's book. Then Eve and Alice traded books, so Alice now has Eve's book. Fred and Alice traded books, so Fred now has Alice's book. Finally, Eve and Dave traded books, so Dave now has Eve's book. 

So, Eve has Dave's book! 


**The answer is (B) Catch-22.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Eve starts as a striker.**  
* Then, Bob and Dave switch places. 
* Dave and Gertrude switch places too.
* Fred and Claire switch places.
* Eve and Claire switch places again.
* Claire and Bob switch places.
* Eve and Fred switch places.
* Alice and Claire switch places.

So, Eve is now playing striker! 

The answer is **(D)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Alice starts:** She's the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Dave switch:**  Alice becomes the left midfielder, and Dave becomes the left winger.
* **Alice and Claire switch:** Alice becomes the benchwarmer, and Claire becomes the left midfielder.
* **Alice and Dave switch again:** Alice becomes the left winger, and Dave becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Fred switch:** Claire becomes the left winger, and Fred becomes the center midfielder.
* **Dave and Eve switch:** Dave becomes the cheerleader, and Eve becomes the center midfielder.
* **Gertrude and Bob switch:** Gertrude becomes the striker, and Bob becomes the fullback.

So, Alice is now the left winger! 

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game! 

Eve and Dave swap balls, then Eve and Fred swap balls, and then Eve and Dave swap balls again.  This means Eve got the red ball, then Dave got the blue ball, and then Eve got the red ball again. 

Then, Eve and Alice swap balls, and Bob and Alice swap balls.  

Finally, Alice and Dave swap balls. 

So, who has the pink ball? 


**Answer: (G)** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Bob is on the right wing, Claire is in the middle, Dave is at the back, Eve is on the left wing, Fred is cheering, and Gertrude is up front.

* **Dave and Eve switch:**  Dave goes to the left, and Eve goes to the back.

* **Eve and Alice switch:** Eve goes to the right, and Alice goes to the back.

* **Claire and Gertrude switch:** Claire goes up front, and Gertrude goes to the middle.

* **Fred and Dave switch:** Fred goes to the back, and Dave goes to the right.

* **Bob and Dave switch:** Bob goes to the middle, and Dave goes to the right.

* **Claire and Dave switch:** Claire goes to the front, and Dave goes to the right.

* **Gertrude and Claire switch:** Gertrude goes to the front, and Claire goes to the middle.

**So, at the end, Bob is on the right wing!** 


**Answer: (G)** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Alice and Eve swap balls.  Then, Dave and Fred swap balls.  And so on.  

Let's look at the last swap: Gertrude and Claire swap balls.  

Who got the ball that Gertrude had?  It was Claire's ball! 

So, who has the ball that Gertrude had?  It was Claire's ball! 

The answer is **(G) blue ball**.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know Eve starts with Jamie. Then, Fred and Claire switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Dave and Eve switch partners.  Then, Gertrude and Fred switch partners.  Then, Alice and Bob switch partners.  Then, Alice and Fred switch partners.  Finally, Fred and Claire switch partners. 

So, who is Eve dancing with at the end? 


**Answer:** (G) Jamie 
"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  Dave has an orange ball.
* **Dave and Fred swap:**  Dave gets a yellow ball, Fred gets an orange ball.

* **Dave and Alice swap:** Dave gets a white ball, Alice gets a black ball.

So, Dave has the blue ball! 

**Answer: (A)** 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that the dancers are switching partners.  Let's look at the changes:

1. Alice and Bob switch partners.
2. Eve and Gertrude switch partners.
3. Alice and Claire switch partners.
4. Eve and Dave switch partners.
5. Bob and Alice switch partners.
6. Bob and Fred switch partners.
7. Bob and Eve switch partners.

Now, let's see who is dancing with who at the end.  

**The answer is (C) Melissa.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out what Gertrude has!

1. **Start:**  Bob has a white present, Claire has a pink ball, Dave has a black ball, Eve has a red present, Fred has a brown present, and Gertrude has an orange ball.

2. **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets a red present, and Eve gets a white present.

8. **Fred and Bob swap:**  Fred gets an orange ball, and Bob gets a white present.

**So, now Gertrude has the pink ball!**

**Answer: (B)**

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that at the start, everyone has a partner. Then, some people switch partners.  Let's see who switches with whom:

* **Dave and Claire switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Claire switch partners.**
* **Claire and Eve switch partners.**
* **Gertrude and Eve switch partners.**
* **Fred and Claire switch partners.**
* **Bob and Alice switch partners.**
* **Eve and Claire switch partners.**

Now, let's look at who is left dancing with who at the end.  

**The answer is (B) Lola.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Let's see what happens when they swap gifts:

* **Eve and Dave swap:**  Eve gets Dave's present, and Dave gets Eve's present.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Alice's present.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Bob gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Bob's present.
* **Gertrude and Fred swap:** Gertrude gets Fred's present, and Fred gets Gertrude's present.
* **Dave and Gertrude swap:** Dave gets Gertrude's present, and Gertrude gets Dave's present.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice gets Claire's present, and Claire gets Alice's present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets Bob's present, and Bob gets Claire's present.

Now, let's think about who has what at the end.  

**The answer is (E) black ball.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the players are switching positions.  Here's what we know:

* **Eve starts as a right midfielder.**
* **Fred and Eve switch places.**  
* **Eve and Claire switch places.**
* **Gertrude and Alice switch places.**
* **Dave and Bob switch places.**
* **Claire and Alice switch places.**
* **Bob and Alice switch places.**
* **Gertrude and Eve switch places.**

So, Eve is now playing left winger! 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, let's see! 

We know that Bob started with Izzi. Then Eve and Bob switched partners.  Then, Gertrude and Dave switched partners.  Then Eve and Claire switched partners.  Then Alice and Bob switched partners.  Then Bob and Fred switched partners.  Finally, Fred and Claire switched partners. 

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end? 

* **(A) Patrick**
* **(B) Jamie**
* **(C) Melissa**
* **(D) Karl**

"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Swaps:**  We need to see who gets which ball after each swap.

**Here's what happens:**

1. **Claire and Bob:** Claire and Bob swap their balls.
2. **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice and Gertrude swap their balls.
3. **Claire and Dave:** Claire and Dave swap their balls.
4. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave and Gertrude swap their balls.
5. **Eve and Fred:** Eve and Fred swap their balls.
6. **Bob and Eve:** Bob and Eve swap their balls.
7. **Gertrude and Claire:** Gertrude and Claire swap their balls.

**The last swap:**  Gertrude and Claire swap their balls.  

**The answer:** Eve ends up with the purple ball.

"Gertrude got the green ball!  

The answer is (C). 
"
"Okay, let's see!  

We know that Fred and Melissa are dancing together at the end.  We also know that Fred and Bob switched partners, and then Eve and Bob switched partners.  

So, Fred must be with Melissa now! 


The answer is (D). 
"
"Okay, let's figure out what Claire has!

Here's what we know:

* **Start:**  Alice is blue, Bob is purple, Claire is white, Dave is orange, Eve is yellow, Fred is brown, and Gertrude is pink.

* **Bob and Gertrude swap:**  Bob gets pink, and Gertrude gets purple.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Gertrude gets orange, and Dave gets pink.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:**  Eve gets pink, and Gertrude gets yellow.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  Bob gets yellow, and Dave gets pink.
* **Claire and Dave swap:**  Claire gets orange, and Dave gets white.
* **Fred and Alice swap:**  Fred gets blue, and Alice gets brown.
* **Bob and Eve swap:**  Bob gets yellow, and Eve gets blue.

Now, let's think about who has the orange ball. 


**Answer:**  Claire has the orange ball. 


"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that everyone starts with a new book.  Then they trade books with each other.  Let's see who gets what book at the end!

* **Alice** starts with *The Great Gatsby*.
* **Bob** starts with *Lolita*.
* **Claire** starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* **Dave** starts with *Moby Dick*.
* **Eve** starts with *Ulysses*.
* **Fred** starts with *Frankenstein*.
* **Gertrude** starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring*.

Now, let's see who trades with who:

* **Gertrude and Dave swap books.**  
* **Fred and Eve swap books.**
* **Gertrude and Bob swap books.**
* **Claire and Alice swap books.**
* **Eve and Claire swap books.**
* **Eve and Bob swap books.**
* **Bob and Alice swap books.**

Now, let's think about who has the book *Ulysses* at the end. 



**Answer:**  (E) Ulysses 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Claire is playing at the end!

* **Start:**  We know Alice is in the left midfield, Bob is in the center midfield, Claire is on the bench, Dave is cheering, Eve is in the striker position, Fred is in the right midfield, and Gertrude is on the right wing.

* **Trades:**  We see some players swap places.  Dave and Gertrude switch places, then Dave and Fred switch places, and then Alice and Dave switch places.  Alice and Gertrude switch places again, and then Bob and Eve switch places.  Finally, Dave and Alice switch places again.

* **The End:**  Claire and Dave switch places.  So, Claire is now playing right winger! 


**So the answer is (D).** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that everyone starts with a different color gift.  Let's see what happens when they swap gifts:

* **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  Dave gets the orange ball from Gertrude.
* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred gets the purple present from Eve.
* **Bob and Fred swap:** Bob gets the white present from Fred.
* **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice gets the blue present from Dave.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire gets the red present from Alice.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** Claire gets the purple present from Fred.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets the purple present from Eve.

So, at the end, Dave has the orange ball! 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out where Fred is playing!

* **Start:** Fred is on the right wing.
* **Dave and Alice trade:**  Dave goes to the bench, and Alice goes to the center.
* **Fred and Claire trade:** Fred goes to the left wing, and Claire goes to the right wing.
* **Gertrude and Eve trade:** Gertrude goes to the left wing, and Eve goes to the fullback.
* **Bob and Alice trade:** Bob goes to the center, and Alice goes to the right wing.
* **Bob and Gertrude trade:** Bob goes to the fullback, and Gertrude goes to the center.
* **Gertrude and Alice trade:** Gertrude goes to the right wing, and Alice goes to the fullback.
* **Eve and Bob trade:** Eve goes to the center, and Bob goes to the left wing.

So, Fred is still on the right wing! 

**Answer:** (D) right winger. 



"
"Okay, let's look at the dance moves!

* **Fred and Claire switch partners:**  Fred and Claire switch places.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** Alice and Bob switch places.
* **Dave and Eve switch partners:** Dave and Eve switch places.
* **Gertrude and Fred switch partners:** Gertrude and Fred switch places.
* **Alice and Bob switch partners:** Alice and Bob switch places.
* **Alice and Fred switch partners:** Alice and Fred switch places.
* **Fred and Claire switch partners:** Fred and Claire switch places.

So, who is Bob dancing with at the end?  

**The answer is (G) Melissa.** 



"
"Okay, let's see!  

We know that Bob and Fred switched partners. Then Claire and Alice switched partners.  Then Claire and Dave switched partners.  Then Gertrude and Alice switched partners.  Then Claire and Bob switched partners. Then Dave and Fred switched partners. Finally, Eve and Alice switched partners. 

So, who is Bob dancing with now? 


* **(A) Rodrigo**
* **(B) Lola**
* **(C) Melissa**
* **(D) Karl**
* **(E) Sam**
* **(F) Izzi**
* **(G) Patrick** 


 
Let me know what you think! 
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude all got new books at the start of the semester.  Then they traded books with each other. 

Let's see who got which book at the end:

* **Alice** got a book from someone else.
* **Bob** got a book from someone else.
* **Claire** got a book from someone else.
* **Dave** got a book from someone else.
* **Eve** got a book from someone else.
* **Fred** got a book from someone else.
* **Gertrude** got a book from someone else.

We need to figure out who got which book at the end.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know that at the start, everyone has a partner.  Then, some people switch partners.  Let's see who switches with whom:

* Alice and Gertrude switch partners.
* Dave and Gertrude switch partners.
* Fred and Gertrude switch partners.
* Eve and Bob switch partners.
* Gertrude and Alice switch partners.
* Dave and Eve switch partners.
* Claire and Eve switch partners.

Now, let's think about who is left with Dave at the end.  

**The answer is (B) Melissa.** 



"
"Okay, let's figure out what Bob has!

We know that everyone starts with a different color present.  Here's what happens:

1. **Gertrude and Dave swap:**  They switch presents.
2. **Claire and Dave swap:** They switch presents again.
3. **Eve and Claire swap:** They switch presents.
4. **Dave and Alice swap:** They switch presents.
5. **Alice and Gertrude swap:** They switch presents.
6. **Gertrude and Eve swap:** They switch presents.
7. **Fred and Bob swap:** They switch presents.

Now, think about it like a game of tag!  Each time someone swaps, they get a new present.  

So, who has the present that Bob started with? 

**The answer is (B) yellow.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about it step by step!

1. **Who starts with what?**  Bob starts with Frankenstein.
2. **Who swaps with who?**  We need to see who swaps with whom. 
3. **What happens next?**  We need to see who swaps with whom again. 

Let's look at the swaps:

* **Gertrude and Alice swap:**  This doesn't change Bob's book.
* **Bob and Fred swap:**  This means Fred gets Bob's book.
* **Bob and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Bob's book.
* **Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Bob's book.
* **Claire and Alice swap:**  This means Alice gets Claire's book.
* **Claire and Fred swap:**  This means Fred gets Claire's book.
* **Eve and Dave swap:**  This means Dave gets Eve's book.

**So, who has the book Bob started with?** 

**The answer is (C).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, we know everyone starts with a different color ball.  Then, people trade balls with each other.  

* Claire and Dave swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Eve and Alice swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Gertrude and Eve swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Claire and Alice swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Dave and Eve swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Alice and Gertrude swap, so they each get the other's ball.
* Fred and Bob swap, so Fred gets Bob's ball.

Fred now has the pink ball! 


The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure out who has The Great Gatsby at the end!

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Eve and Gertrude swap:** Eve gets Ulysses, Gertrude gets The Odyssey.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob gets The Odyssey, Eve gets The Great Gatsby.
* **Alice and Gertrude swap:** Alice gets The Odyssey, Gertrude gets Ulysses.
* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire gets The Odyssey, Eve gets Catch-22.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Alice gets The Odyssey.
* **Fred and Alice swap:** Fred gets The Odyssey, Alice gets Catch-22.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve gets Catch-22, Dave gets The Odyssey.

"Okay, let's look at the positions!

* **Start:** Fred is on the right wing.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:**  Eve goes to the bench, and Gertrude goes to the left wing.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve goes to the center, and Bob goes to the left wing.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob goes to the back, and Dave goes to the left wing.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude goes to the back, and Claire goes to the left wing.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob goes to the back, and Eve goes to the left wing.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve goes to the right wing, and Alice goes to the left wing.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Fred goes to the right wing, and Bob goes to the center.

So, Fred is now on the right wing! 

**Answer: (E)** 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out! 

We know that Alice, Bob, Claire, Dave, Eve, Fred, and Gertrude all have different colored presents.  

Here's what we know:

* **Alice:**  Starts with a blue present.
* **Bob:** Starts with a green present.
* **Claire:** Starts with a brown present.
* **Dave:** Starts with a purple present.
* **Eve:** Starts with an orange ball.
* **Fred:** Starts with a pink ball.
* **Gertrude:** Starts with a red present.

Now, let's see how the gifts change hands:

* **Eve and Claire swap:**  This means Eve's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Eve's.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This means Fred's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Fred's.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** This means Dave's present is now Bob's, and Bob's present is now Dave's.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This means Alice's present is now Claire's, and Claire's present is now Alice's.
* **Dave and Alice swap:** This means Dave's present is now Alice's, and Alice's present is now Dave's.
* **Gertrude and Eve swap:** This means Gertrude's present is now Eve's, and Eve's present is now Gertrude's.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** This means Claire's present is now Gertrude's, and Gertrude's present is now Claire's.

So, after all the swaps, who has the brown present? 



**Answer:** (E) brown present 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

Gertrude starts with the orange ball.  Then, Bob and Alice swap gifts.  Then, Claire and Dave swap gifts.  Then, Bob and Gertrude swap gifts.  Then, Fred and Bob swap gifts.  Then, Claire and Eve swap gifts.  Finally, Alice and Bob swap gifts.

So, who has the orange ball at the end? 


**Answer:** (D) orange ball 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

First, Alice and Eve swap balls. Then, Dave and Fred swap balls.  They keep swapping until everyone has a different ball.  

Finally, Claire gets the black ball. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game! 

We know everyone starts with a ball.  Then, they trade balls with other people.  

* **Claire and Bob:** They trade, but it doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Claire and Dave:** They trade, but it doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** They trade, but it doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:** They trade, but it doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Fred:** They trade, but it doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Alice and Dave:** They trade, but it doesn't change the color of the balls.
* **Eve and Claire:** They trade, but it doesn't change the color of the balls.

So, the colors of the balls don't change. 


**Answer:**  None of the above. 
"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve starts with a purple ball, and Claire starts with a pink ball. They swap, so Claire now has the purple ball.
* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob starts with a black ball, and Eve now has a purple ball. They swap, so Bob now has the purple ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Alice now has the purple ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob now has the purple ball, and Alice has the pink ball. They swap, so Bob now has the pink ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave now has the purple ball, and Eve has the purple ball. They swap, so Dave now has the purple ball.
* **Fred and Gertrude swap:** Fred now has the purple ball, and Gertrude has the brown ball. They swap, so Fred now has the brown ball.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude now has the brown ball, and Claire has the pink ball. They swap, so Gertrude now has the pink ball.

So, at the end of the game, Claire has the pink ball! 


**The answer is (F).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the positions!

* **Start:**  Alice is the striker, Bob is the right winger, Claire is the center midfielder, Dave is the cheerleader, Eve is the right midfielder, Fred is the left winger, and Gertrude is the left midfielder.

* **Fred and Eve swap:** Fred becomes the left midfielder, and Eve becomes the right winger.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve becomes the center midfielder, and Claire becomes the right winger.
* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** Gertrude becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the center midfielder.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave becomes the right winger, and Bob becomes the center midfielder.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire becomes the left winger, and Alice becomes the striker.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob becomes the striker, and Alice becomes the left winger.

"Okay, let's think about this!

Fred got Frankenstein at the start.  Then, some people traded books.  We need to see who traded with Fred.  

* Fred traded with Eve.
* Fred traded with Eve. 
* Fred traded with Eve. 

Fred traded with Eve.  So Fred's book is Frankenstein. 


The answer is **(C) Frankenstein**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Start:** Everyone has a different color ball.
* **Trading:**  People trade balls with each other in pairs. 
* **The Goal:** We need to figure out who ends up with which ball.

Let's see what happens:

1. **Alice and Fred:** Alice gives Fred her ball, and Fred gets Alice's ball.
2. **Claire and Eve:** Claire gives Eve her ball, and Eve gets Claire's ball.
3. **Dave and Gertrude:** Dave gives Gertrude her ball, and Gertrude gets Dave's ball.
4. **Eve and Dave:** Eve gives Dave his ball, and Dave gets Eve's ball.

6. **Fred and Claire:** Fred gives Claire her ball, and Claire gets Fred's ball.
7. **Claire and Bob:** Claire gives Bob her ball, and Bob gets Claire's ball.

**The last person with a ball is Dave!**

**So the answer is (E).** 



"
"Okay, let's think about the books!

* **Start:** Everyone gets a new book.
* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice gets Bob's book, and Bob gets Alice's book.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve gets Alice's book, and Alice gets Eve's book.
* **Claire and Gertrude swap:** Claire gets Gertrude's book, and Gertrude gets Claire's book.
* **Dave and Fred swap:** Dave gets Fred's book, and Fred gets Dave's book.
* **Gertrude and Claire swap:** Gertrude gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Gertrude's book.
* **Eve and Claire swap:** Eve gets Claire's book, and Claire gets Eve's book.
* **Gertrude and Dave swap:** Gertrude gets Dave's book, and Dave gets Gertrude's book.

Now, look at the end. Dave has the book he got from Fred.  So the answer is **(D) Catch-22**. 



"
"Okay, let's see!  

Eve and Fred switch partners. Then, Bob and Claire switch partners. Then, Bob and Dave switch partners. Then, Gertrude and Fred switch partners. Then, Alice and Fred switch partners. Then, Bob and Eve switch partners. Finally, Gertrude and Dave switch partners. 

Eve is dancing with Helga at the end. 

So the answer is **(F)**.

* **Alice and Dave** traded books.
* **Fred and Claire** traded books.

* **Eve and Fred** traded books.

The last trade was between Eve and Fred.  

So, who has the book at the end?

* **Eve and Alice:** Eve gives Alice her ball, and Alice gives Eve her ball.

So, at the end, who has the ball?

"
"Okay, let's think about the game!

* **Eve and Fred:** Eve starts with orange, Fred starts with pink. They swap, so Fred now has orange and Eve has pink.
* **Dave and Claire:** Dave starts with black, Claire starts with red. They swap, so Claire now has black and Dave has red.
* **Alice and Gertrude:** Alice starts with white, Gertrude starts with purple. They swap, so Gertrude now has white and Alice has purple.
* **Gertrude and Eve:** Gertrude now has white, Eve has pink. They swap, so Eve now has white and Gertrude has pink.
* **Eve and Fred:** Eve now has white, Fred has orange. They swap, so Fred now has white and Eve has orange.
* **Fred and Alice:** Fred now has white, Alice has orange. They swap, so Alice now has white and Fred has orange.
* **Alice and Bob:** Alice now has white, Bob has yellow. They swap, so Bob now has white and Alice has yellow.

* **Start:**  We have Alice with green, Bob with orange, Claire with pink, Dave with red, Eve with black, Fred with yellow, and Gertrude with blue.

* **Swaps:**  We see that people swap gifts, but we don't know if they change colors. 

* **The End:**  We need to figure out what Claire has at the end. 


**Answer:** (G) pink ball. 



"
"Okay, let's think about the gifts!

* **Start:**  Alice has red, Bob has orange, Claire has pink, Dave has purple, Eve has brown, Fred has black, and Gertrude has green.

First, Bob and Claire trade balls.  Bob gets the blue ball, and Claire gets the brown ball. 

Then, Alice and Bob trade. Alice gets the blue ball, and Bob gets the black ball.

Finally, Claire and Bob trade again. Claire gets the black ball, and Bob gets the blue ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the blue ball! 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about it step by step:

1. **Start:** Alice is with Karl, Bob is with Rodrigo, and Claire is with Patrick.
2. **Switch 1:** Claire and Alice switch partners. So now Alice is with Patrick, and Claire is with Karl.
3. **Switch 2:** Bob and Alice switch partners. So now Alice is with Rodrigo, and Bob is with Claire.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is with Rodrigo! 

**The answer is (C) Rodrigo.** 



"
"Okay, let's think about it!

* **First, Bob and Alice swap:**  This means Bob gets Alice's blue present, and Alice gets Bob's orange ball.
* **Then, Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire gets Alice's blue present, and Alice gets Claire's brown present.

So, at the end, Claire will have the blue present! 

The answer is **(C).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it:

* Alice starts as a cheerleader.
* Then, she and Claire switch places.  
* Then, Bob and Alice switch places.
* Finally, Claire and Bob switch places again.

So, who is playing where at the end?  

**The answer is Bob is playing goalkeeper.** 


 
"
"Okay, let's think about it step by step:

1. **Bob starts with Lola.**
2. **Bob and Claire switch partners.**  So now Bob is with Alice.
3. **Claire and Alice switch partners.** So now Claire is with Bob.
4. **Bob and Alice switch partners.** So now Bob is with Claire.

So, at the end, Bob is dancing with Claire! 


The answer is **(A) Patrick**. 
"
"Okay, so let's think about the dance moves:

* Alice and Bob switch partners.  That means they swap places.
* Then Alice and Claire switch partners.  They also swap places.

Now, let's think about who is dancing with who at the end.  Bob is dancing with Izzi. 


**Answer:** (A) 
"
"Okay, let's think about the dance! 

* **First, Bob and Alice switch partners.**  This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is now with Bob.
* **Then, Bob and Claire switch partners.** This means Bob is now with Alice, and Claire is now with Bob.
* **Finally, Bob and Alice switch partners again.** This means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is now with Bob.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with **Bob**. 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **First, Bob and Alice switch partners.**  That means Bob is now with Claire, and Alice is with Patrick.
2. **Then, Claire and Bob switch partners.**  Now Claire is with Izzi, and Bob is with Ophelia.
3. **Finally, Claire and Alice switch partners.**  This means Claire is with Patrick, and Alice is with Izzi.

So, at the end of the dance, Claire is dancing with **Patrick**. 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about the dance moves!

* **Bob and Claire switch partners:**  This means Bob now dances with Alice, and Claire now dances with Sam.
* **Claire and Alice switch partners:** This means Claire now dances with Bob, and Alice now dances with Sam.

So, at the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Sam. 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Alice starts with a red ball. Then, she and Bob swap, so Bob gets the red ball and Alice gets the orange ball. 

Then, Alice and Claire swap, so Alice gets the black ball and Claire gets the orange ball.

Finally, Claire and Bob swap, so Claire gets the orange ball and Bob gets the black ball.

So, at the end, Alice has the orange ball! 


**The answer is (B).** 
"
"Okay, so let's think about it step by step:

1. **Alice starts with a yellow ball.**
2. **Alice and Claire swap balls.**  This means Claire gets the yellow ball and Alice gets the blue ball.
3. **Bob and Claire swap balls.**  This means Bob gets the blue ball and Claire gets the yellow ball.
4. **Alice and Claire swap balls.**  This means Alice gets the blue ball and Claire gets the yellow ball.

So, Claire has the yellow ball at the end! 


**The answer is (C).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

* Alice starts with Ulysses.
* Bob starts with Catch-22.
* Claire starts with Moby Dick.

They trade books, so let's see what happens:

* Claire and Alice trade, so Claire gets Catch-22 and Alice gets Moby Dick.
* Claire and Bob trade, so Claire gets Ulysses and Bob gets Moby Dick.

So, at the end, Claire has Ulysses! 

The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so let's think about it like this:

* **Alice starts with yellow.**
* **Bob starts with white.**
* **Claire starts with purple.**

Now, they swap gifts.  

* **Alice and Bob swap:**  Alice gets Bob's white present, and Bob gets Alice's yellow present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob gets Claire's purple present, and Claire gets Bob's yellow present.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob gets Claire's purple present, and Alice gets Bob's yellow present.

So, at the end, Claire has the yellow present! 


**The answer is (A).** 
"
"Okay, let's think about this!

Alice got Lolita, Bob got Hound of the Baskervilles, and Claire got The Fellowship of the Ring.  

Then, Claire and Bob switch books.  So Claire gets Bob's book and Bob gets Claire's book.

Then, Alice and Bob switch books.  So Alice gets Bob's book and Bob gets Alice's book.

So, who has the book at the end?  

**The answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, here's how we can figure this out:

* **Alice starts with:** The Fellowship of the Ring

"Okay, let's think about this!

First, we know Alice has a yellow present. Then, Claire and Alice swap presents.  So, Claire gets Alice's yellow present and Alice gets Claire's green present. 

Then, Bob and Claire swap presents.  So, Bob gets Alice's yellow present and Claire gets Bob's purple present.

Finally, Alice and Bob swap presents. So, Alice gets Bob's purple present and Bob gets Alice's yellow present.

So, who has the purple present at the end? 


**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, let's think about it!

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire starts with the yellow ball, and Bob starts with the brown ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:**  This means Alice starts with the brown ball, and Claire starts with the yellow ball.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** This means Bob starts with the yellow ball, and Claire starts with the brown ball.
