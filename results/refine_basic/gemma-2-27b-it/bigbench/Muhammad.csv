We know the flutist lives in the second house.  The pianist is either one house to the left or right of the flutist. The lilies are to the left of the carnations, and the tulips are to the left of the guitarist.

1. The tulips aren't in the third house.
2. The SUV is right next to the lilies.
3. The sedan and roses are right next to each other.
4. The roses aren't in the second house.

Hmm... if the roses aren't in the second house and they're next to the sedan, then the roses must be in the first house and the sedan in the second.

"
"As-salamu alaykum!

Let's see... the sedan is to the left of the lilies, meaning the lilies can't be in the first house. Also, the flutist doesn't live in the first house either.  This means the lilies must be in the second house.

Therefore, the pianist lives in house **(A) 3**. 



"
"As-salamu alaykum!

"
"As-salamu alaykum! This is a fun puzzle. Let's see...

We know the rose bouquet is in the second house.  And the person who loves science fiction lives next to them.  Since the fantasy reader is to the left of the science fiction fan, the science fiction fan must be in house 3, and the fantasy reader in house 1.

The romance reader is to the right of the carnations, and right next to the tulips. This means the tulips are in house 4, the romance reader in house 3, and the carnations in house 2.

"
"As-salamu alaykum! This is a fun puzzle. Let's see...

We know the person with the high heels lives to the left of the person with the sandals, and the grapes and sandals are right next to each other. That means the order must be high heels, grapes, then sandals.

Thinking about the two houses, the only way this can work is if the person with the television is in the second house and eats kiwis.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"As-salamu alaykum! This is a fun puzzle. Let me see...

The tea drinker lives in the first house, and the violinist can't be in the last house.  The water drinker is always to the right of the cellist.  And the violinist and guitarist have to have a house between them.

"
"As-salamu alaykum! This is a fun puzzle. Let's see...

We know the bird keeper can't be in house number 2 because the grilled cheese eater lives to their right. And the percussionist can't be in house 2 either. This means the percussionist must be in house 1.

That leaves house 2 for the guitarist. Since the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater in house 2.

Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in house 1.

The answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
