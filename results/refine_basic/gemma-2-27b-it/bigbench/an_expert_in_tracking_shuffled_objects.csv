"
"Ah, a classic case of misplaced items! Let's see... we have four houses, each with a unique resident and their floral arrangement and literary preference.  

By carefully analyzing the clues, I can deduce the following:

The rose bouquet is a key piece of the puzzle. It's located in the second house.  This, combined with the fact that the science fiction enthusiast lives next to the rose bouquet, places the science fiction fan in the third house.

Now, the romance reader is a bit of a wanderer, always found to the right of the carnations and directly left of the tulips. This means the tulips must be in the fourth house, and the romance reader in the third.

Finally, the fantasy enthusiast must be in the first house, leaving the lilies for the fourth house.

Therefore, the lilies reside in **(C) 4**. 




"
"Analyzing the clues, we can deduce the following:

The science fiction enthusiast must reside in house number 1 due to the direct statement provided.  Since the coffee drinker lives to the left of the sandal wearer, and house 1 is on the left, the coffee drinker occupies house 1 and the sandal wearer house 2. This leaves house number 2 for the romance book lover.

Therefore, the answer is **(B) 2**. 

"
"Ah, a classic case of positional deduction!  Let's see... percussionist to the left of the radio... that means the percussionist is in house number 1.  Since they each have a different device, the phone must belong to the resident of house 1.

The answer is **(C)**. 

"
"Analyzing the spatial relationships, we can deduce the answer. The clue states the carnations are to the left of the dog owner.  Given the house numbering, this places the carnations in house number 1. 


**(B) 1** 

"
"Analyzing the clues, the key lies in the positioning.  The person wearing high heels must be in the house next to the one who drinks only water.  Since the kiwi eater is in house number 2, and the sandals wearer is to the left of the yellow-lover, the high heels must be in house number 2.

**(B) 2** 

"
"Analyzing the clues, we can deduce the following:

The arrangement must have high heels preceding sandals, with grapes directly beside sandals.  This leaves us with two possible scenarios.

Scenario one places the tea drinker and television in the first house, while the second scenario places them in the second house.

Since the tea drinker must be to the left of the television owner, and the television owner can't be the one with grapes or sandals, the television owner must be the kiwi eater.

Therefore, the kiwi eater resides in **House 2**.

**(A) 2**

"
"Let's analyze the clues to pinpoint the pizza eater's location.

We know the bird keeper isn't in the second house because the grilled cheese enthusiast lives to their right.  The percussionist also can't be in the second house. This means the percussionist must be in the first house.

Since the percussionist is in the first house, the second house must belong to the guitarist.  Because the grilled cheese eater is right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the grilled cheese eater in the second.

Therefore, the pizza eater must reside in the first house.

**(B) 1**

"Ah, a classic case of misplaced items! Let's see... we have four houses, four fruits, and four colors.  

The key here is to look for the most rigid connections. The person eating grapes is fixed in the second house.  And, the red-lover must be to the right of the kiwi enthusiast.  

Since red and green are neighbors, and white is one house away from both red and the banana eater, the order has to be: White - Green - Red. This means the kiwi eater must be in the first house.

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Ah, a classic case of misplaced items! Let's see... we have two houses, two individuals, and a trail of clues.

"
"Ah, a classic case of misplaced items! Let's see... we have four houses, each with a unique resident and their corresponding fruit and pet.  

By carefully analyzing the clues, I can deduce the following:

The arrangement must have the banana eater directly to the left of the dog owner.  The horse owner can't be in the first two houses, and the mango eater is already in the first. This leaves the horse owner in either the third or fourth house.

The bird keeper and kiwi eater are neighbors, and the banana can't be in the third house. This means the banana must be in the second house, the dog owner in the third, and the bird keeper and kiwi eater in the third and fourth houses.

Since the horse owner can only be in the fourth house, the bird keeper must reside in the **third house**. 


The answer is **(D) 3**. 

"
"Ah, a classic case of misplaced belongings! Let's see... we have three houses, three individuals, and a jumble of preferences.  

The key here is to look for connections. The mystery reader being fixed in the first house is our anchor.  The bird enthusiast being right next to the history buff narrows things down considerably.  

Eliminating the third house for both the romance reader and the horse owner leaves only one possible location for our romance aficionado.

The answer is **(B) 2**.
