"
"Let's break down this puzzle by carefully considering the relationships between the clues. 

We know the computer and grilled cheese must be next to each other, and grilled cheese can't be in the last house. This means they occupy houses 1 and 2.  Since loafers and the computer are also neighbors, with the phone coming after the computer, loafers must be in house 1, the computer in house 2, and the phone in house 3.

Now, we know grilled cheese is in house 1.  Because pizza isn't in house 2, it must be in house 3.  

The clue about grapes being to the right of boots helps us place boots in house 1 and grapes in house 2.  Mangos being left of yellow means mangos are in house 1 and yellow in house 2.

This leaves apples for house 3.

* **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives to the right of the person with the computer. This eliminates the possibility of the computer being in house 3.

* **Clue 5:** The violinist doesn't live in the first house.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the following:

* House 1: Either the sedan or the gameboy.
* House 2: Either the SUV or the gameboy.

"Let's break down this puzzle.  We have five houses and five individuals, each with a unique sport and lunch preference.  

The key to solving this is understanding the relationships between the clues. For example, we know the tennis player is in the third house, and the golfer is in the fourth. Clue 4 tells us fried rice and spaghetti are separated by one house.

Considering the placement of the tennis player and golfer, and the separation required for fried rice and spaghetti, we can deduce the cricketer must live in house **(B) 2**. 



"
"Let's break down this puzzle using the clues provided.

* The key is recognizing that several clues link characteristics directly. For example, the person who likes white lives immediately next to the spaghetti eater.

*  We also know the baseball player and spaghetti eater are neighbors, and the water drinker is next to the spaghetti eater.

Considering these connections, we can deduce that the person who eats spaghetti must be in house 1, with the white-loving resident beside them. This means the baseball player and water drinker are in house 2.

The root beer lover can't be in the second house, and neither can the orange eater. This means the mango eater must be in the second house.

Since the coffee drinker is to the left of the mango eater, they must be in the first house. This leaves the third house for both the water drinker and the root beer lover.


Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house **(C) 3**. 

"
"Let's analyze the clues to determine the loafers wearer's house number.

Since the loafers wearer isn't in House 1, the only remaining option is House 2. 


The answer is **(A) 2**. 

"
"This puzzle requires careful analysis of the relationships between the clues.  

Let's break it down. The key is to look for clues that directly link elements together, then use those links to build a chain of deductions.

From there, we can use clues about relative positions (like ""lives to the left of"") and direct connections (like ""lives directly left of"") to fill in the rest of the grid.

Remember, every clue is a piece of the puzzle. By carefully considering how they relate to each other, you can uncover the solution.

* **Characteristics:** Each person has unique preferences for lunch, pets, books, and shoes.

Let's examine the clues:

1. **Sandals and Horses:** The person wearing sandals lives to the left of the person who owns horses. This means House 1 has sandals, and House 2 has horses.

2. **History and Spaghetti:** The history book buff lives to the right of the spaghetti eater. This could mean either:
    * House 1: Spaghetti, House 2: History buff
    * House 1: History buff, House 2: Spaghetti

"
"Let's break down this puzzle by carefully considering the relationships between the clues. 

We know the person with carnations lives in the fifth house.  This means the person wearing boots must live in the fourth house, as they are direct neighbors.

The clue about tulips being to the left of loafers, combined with the fact that tulips are right of daffodils, helps us establish a sequence.  Since tulips can't be in the fourth house, this sequence must start with daffodils.

We know the rose bouquet is in the second house.  The science fiction fan lives next to the rose bouquet, meaning they must be in house 3. The romance book lover is to the right of the carnations and directly left of the tulips. This places the tulips in house 4 and the romance book lover in house 3. Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction fan, they must be in house 1.

This leaves house 4 for the lilies. 


The answer is **(C)**.

"
"Let's break down this puzzle using the clues provided.

We know the high heel wearer lives to the left of the sandal wearer, and the grape eater and sandal wearer are right next to each other. This means the order must be high heels, grapes, then sandals.

We also know the tea drinker is to the left of the television owner.

Considering these facts and the limited space of two houses, the only possible arrangement is:

* **House 1:** High Heels - Grapes - Sandals
* **House 2:** Tea Drinker - Television

Since the television owner can't be the grape eater or sandal wearer, and they can't be the tea drinker (who is to their left), they must be the kiwi eater. 


Therefore, the kiwi eater lives in **House 2**.

**(A) 2**

The Grilled Cheese and Spaghetti are right next to each other, and the Radio is one house away from the Grilled Cheese. This means the Grilled Cheese is in house 3, Spaghetti in house 4, and the Radio in house 2.

The Television is to the left of the Phone, and the only spots left are houses 5 and 6. This means the Television is in house 5 and the Phone in house 6.

1. Kiwi eater
2. Grapes
3. Green
4. Banana (and Yellow)

The only way Claire could end up with *Lolita* is if she trades with someone who had it.  Since Alice had *Lolita* at one point, Claire must have traded with her.

Therefore, the answer is **(A) Lolita**. 



"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine Bob's final dance partner.  Bob starts with Rodrigo, then dances with Patrick, Izzi, and finally Jamie. 


The answer is **(C) Jamie**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* **Claire and Alice swap:** This means Claire now has the brown ball, and Alice has the black ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob now has the black ball, and Alice has the purple ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** Eve now has the green ball, and Dave has the yellow ball.
* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave now has the brown ball, and Claire has the yellow ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice ends up with the purple ball, and Bob has the black ball.

Therefore, Dave ends up with the brown ball. 

The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the gift exchanges:

* **Claire and Dave swap:** This means Claire now has the orange ball, and Dave has the green present.
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Bob now has the orange ball, and Claire has the red present.
* **Claire and Dave swap again:** Claire gets the green present back, and Dave gets the orange ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice ends up with the black ball, and Eve now has the yellow present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire gets the red present back, and Bob has the green present.

Therefore, Eve ends up with the **(D) yellow present**. 



"
"Let's track the books as they move between friends:

* **Start:** Alice - Ulysses, Bob - Frankenstein, Claire - Moby Dick, Dave - Lolita, Eve - The Pearl

* **Claire and Eve swap:** Claire - The Pearl, Eve - Moby Dick

* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave - Frankenstein, Bob - Lolita

* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire - Lolita, Bob - The Pearl

* **Eve and Bob swap:** Eve - The Pearl, Bob - Moby Dick

At the end, Dave is left with **Ulysses**. 

**Answer: (E)** 



"
"Let's carefully trace the partner swaps:

* Dave starts with Lola.
* He switches with Eve, so he's with Rodrigo.
* They switch back to their original partners, so Dave is back with Lola.
* Dave then switches with Bob, ending up with Patrick. 


So the answer is **(D) Patrick**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the gift exchanges:

* **Dave and Eve swap:** This means Dave now has the yellow present, and Eve has the red one.

"
"Let's track the books as they move between friends:

* **Start:**
    * Alice: Hound of the Baskervilles
    * Bob: Moby Dick
    * Claire: The Fellowship of the Ring
    * Dave: The Odyssey
    * Eve: Frankenstein

* **Trades:**

* **End:** Dave ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring.


**Therefore, the answer is (D).** 

"
"Alice ends up with the black ball. Here's why:

The key is to carefully track the swaps.  Notice that Alice only swaps gifts with Claire and Bob. Since Bob ends up with the orange ball, Alice must have received the black ball from him in their exchange. 



"
"Let's carefully track the gift exchanges:

* **Alice starts with yellow, Eve with green.** After they swap, Alice has green and Eve has yellow.
* **Bob starts with orange, Dave with purple.** They swap, so Bob has purple and Dave has orange.
* **Bob (purple) and Eve (yellow) swap.** Now Bob has yellow and Eve has purple.
* **Claire starts with red, Eve has purple.** They swap, leaving Claire with purple and Eve with red.
* **Dave (orange) and Alice (green) swap.**  Dave ends up with yellow and Alice with orange.

Therefore, Dave ends up with the **(A) yellow present**. 



"
"Let's track the movement of Eve's book:

* Eve starts with Moby Dick.
* She swaps with Dave, getting Catch-22.
* She then swaps with Claire, getting Ulysses.
* Next, she swaps with Alice, getting Hound of the Baskervilles.

Therefore, Eve ends up with **(E) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Alice's final position.  

Alice starts as the left winger. After a series of swaps with Dave, Bob, and Claire, she ends up back in the left winger position. 


So the answer is **(E) left winger**. 

"
"Let's track the movement of the gifts:

* **Start:** Alice (Blue), Bob (Black), Claire (Brown), Dave (Orange), Eve (Red)
* **Bob & Dave swap:** Bob (Orange), Dave (Black)
* **Alice & Dave swap:** Alice (Black), Dave (Blue)
* **Eve & Claire swap:** Eve (Brown), Claire (Red)
* **Alice & Bob swap:** Alice (Orange), Bob (Black)
* **Dave & Claire swap:** Dave (Red), Claire (Orange)

Claire ends up with the **(A) orange ball**. 



"
"By carefully tracking the partner swaps, we can determine Claire's final dance partner.  Claire starts with Izzi, then switches with Alice, then switches back, then remains with Izzi while others change partners. 

So the answer is **(B) Izzi**. 



"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine Bob's final dance partner.  

Bob starts with Sam, then dances with Ophelia, Rodrigo, Sam again, and finally ends up dancing with **(B) Sam**. 



"
"Let's analyze the position swaps:

* Bob starts as the center midfielder and only swaps positions with Alice. 
* Since everyone else swaps with Dave or Eve at some point, Bob must end up in Alice's starting position.

Therefore, Bob is playing **(E) benchwarmer** at the end of the match. 



"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* **Start:** Alice (Green), Bob (Blue), Claire (Yellow), Dave (Red), Eve (Brown)
* **Bob & Claire swap:** Bob (Yellow), Claire (Blue), others unchanged
* **Alice & Dave swap:** Alice (Red), Dave (Green), others unchanged
* **Dave & Claire swap:** Dave (Blue), Claire (Red), others unchanged
* **Claire & Bob swap:** Claire (Yellow), Bob (Red), others unchanged
* **Bob & Eve swap:** Bob (Brown), Eve (Red)

Eve ends up with the **(D) red ball**. 



"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* **Claire and Bob swap:**  This means Claire now has the brown ball and Bob has the blue ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire now has the white ball, and Alice has the brown ball.
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave now has the purple ball, and Eve has the yellow ball.
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Bob now has the white ball, and Alice has the blue ball.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire ends up with the blue ball, and Alice has the white ball.

Therefore, Dave ends up with the purple ball.

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Let's track the movement of the presents:

* **Start:** Alice (Green), Bob (Blue), Claire (Red), Dave (Yellow), Eve (Purple)
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Claire (Green), Alice (Red)

* **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice (Yellow), Dave (Red)
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob (Red), Dave (Blue)
* **Dave and Eve swap:** Dave (Purple), Eve (Blue)

Dave ends up with the **(B) purple present**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* **Alice and Eve:** Alice ends up with the red ball.
* **Dave and Claire:** This swap doesn't affect Alice's ball.
* **Dave and Eve:** Again, this doesn't change who has the red ball.
* **Claire and Eve:** Still no impact on Alice's ball.
* **Bob and Eve:** This final swap doesn't involve Alice.

Since Alice started with the black ball and only swapped with Eve, she must now have the red ball.


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Alice ends up with the green ball. Here's why:

Think of it like a chain reaction. Each swap moves the balls around. By carefully tracing the path of the green ball, you'll see it ultimately ends up in Alice's possession. 


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* Eve starts with the brown ball and swaps with Bob, receiving the orange ball.
* She then swaps with Dave, getting the green ball.
*  Eve keeps the green ball through the remaining swaps.

Therefore, Eve ends up with the **(D) green ball**. 



"
"By carefully tracking the partner swaps, we can determine Bob's final dance partner.  

Bob starts with Izzi. He then switches with Claire, then with Dave, and finally ends up dancing with Sam. 


So the answer is **(C) Sam**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the gift exchanges:

* **Eve and Alice swap:** This means Eve now has the white present and Alice has the green present.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire now has the black ball, and Bob has the pink ball.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has the pink ball, and Bob has the green present.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice gets the white present back, and Eve now has the pink ball.
* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave ends up with the green present, and Bob ends up with the orange ball.


Therefore, Bob finishes the exchange with the **(A) orange ball**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* **Eve and Alice:** Eve starts with blue, Alice with yellow. They swap.
* **Eve and Claire:** Eve now has yellow, Claire has red. They swap.
* **Alice and Eve:** Alice has blue, Eve has red. They swap.
* **Bob and Claire:** Bob has white, Claire has yellow. They swap.
* **Dave and Alice:** Dave has pink, Alice has red. They swap.

Following these swaps, Dave ends up with the **red** ball. 

So the answer is (E). 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Claire's final position.  Notice that Claire only swaps positions with Dave and then remains on the bench.  

Therefore, Claire is playing **(A) benchwarmer** at the end of the match. 



"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* **Bob starts with pink and swaps with Claire (brown).**
* **Claire now has pink and swaps with Eve (orange).**
* **Alice (red) swaps with Dave (yellow).**
* **Alice now has yellow and swaps with Bob (brown).**
* **Finally, Dave (red) swaps with Bob (yellow).**

This leaves Bob with the **(B) red ball**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the gift exchanges:

* **Initial Gifts:** Alice (Brown), Bob (Black), Claire (Green), Dave (Purple), Eve (Yellow)

* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob now has Purple, Dave has Black.

* **Bob and Eve swap:** Bob now has Yellow, Eve has Purple.

* **Dave and Claire swap:** Dave now has Green, Claire has Black.

* **Dave and Bob swap:** Dave now has Yellow, Bob has Green.

* **Alice and Dave swap:** Alice now has Yellow, Dave has Brown.

Alice ends up with the **(A) yellow present**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Claire's final position.  

Notice that Claire swaps positions with a different teammate in each round. This means her position is constantly changing.  Since she starts as a striker and ends up swapping with Alice, who began as the cheerleader, Claire will be the cheerleader at the end of the match.

So the answer is **(E) cheerleader**. 



"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* **Eve and Dave:** Eve starts with brown, Dave with red. They swap.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice has orange, Dave now has brown. They swap.

Since Bob only interacted with Dave and Eve, and ended up with the green present after swapping with Eve, the answer is **(D) green present**. 



"
"By carefully tracing the gift swaps, we can determine Dave's final gift.  Dave starts with a black ball. He then receives the white present, then the orange ball, and finally the brown present. 

So the answer is **(E) brown present**. 



"
"Let's track the movement of the books:

* **Bob** starts with Frankenstein and ends up trading it with Dave.
* **Dave** starts with Hound of the Baskervilles, trades it with Bob, then with Claire, and finally ends up with Ulysses.
* **Claire** starts with Ulysses, trades it with Dave, then with Bob, and finally ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles.

Since Bob trades with Dave and Claire multiple times, we can see that he ultimately ends up with **Hound of the Baskervilles**.

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Let's carefully trace the partner swaps:

* Eve and Bob switch partners.
* Alice and Bob switch partners.
* Dave and Eve switch partners.
* Eve and Claire switch partners.
* Finally, Alice and Claire switch partners.

By meticulously following these exchanges, we find that Alice ends up dancing with **(C) Patrick**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the partner swaps:

* Eve starts with Melissa and only switches partners with Dave and Alice. 
* Since Dave and Alice switch partners with each other twice, their final partners will be the same as their initial partners.

Therefore, Eve must end up back with her original partner, **Melissa**.

The answer is **(A)**.

"Alice ends up with the pink ball.  

Here's how we figure that out:

* **Focus on Alice:** We only need to track which gift Alice has at each step.
* **Follow the swaps:** Carefully note who Alice swaps with and what color gift they have. 
* **The final swap:** The last swap is between Alice and Claire. Since Claire starts with the pink ball, Alice will end up with it. 



"
"Let's analyze the position swaps:

Eve only swaps positions with Bob at the very end.  Since Bob was originally the striker, and Eve takes his place, Eve ends up playing **(E) striker**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Dave's final position.  Notice that Dave swaps positions with a different teammate in each round.

"
"Let's analyze the position swaps:

* Claire, who starts as a cheerleader, ends up swapping positions with everyone else on the team. This means she'll ultimately return to her original position.
* Since Claire ends up as a cheerleader again, we can trace back the swaps to see where Bob ends up. 
* Bob swaps with Claire, then Dave, then Claire again. This means he'll end up in Dave's original position.

Therefore, Bob is playing **(D) right winger** at the end of the match. 



"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine Eve's final dance partner.  Eve starts with Ophelia, then dances with Lola, and maintains that partnership throughout the remaining swaps. 

So the answer is **(D) Lola**. 



"
"Let's carefully trace Eve's partners throughout the dance:

* Eve begins with Patrick.
* She then switches with Claire, so Eve is with Jamie.
* Next, she switches with Dave, ending up with Rodrigo.

Eve remains with Rodrigo for the rest of the dance. 

So the answer is **(D) Rodrigo**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the partner swaps:

* **Start:** Bob is with Lola.
* **Claire and Eve switch:** This doesn't affect Bob.
* **Dave and Alice switch:** Still no change for Bob.
* **Claire and Dave switch:**  Still no change for Bob.
* **Claire and Alice switch:** Still no change for Bob.
* **Bob and Eve switch:** Bob is now dancing with Sam.


So the answer is **(A) Sam**.

* Eve starts with brown and swaps with Alice (white).
* Dave starts with orange and swaps with Bob (yellow).
* Claire starts with blue and swaps with Alice (now brown).
* Alice (now blue) swaps with Dave (now yellow).
* Finally, Eve (white) swaps with Alice (blue).

This means Eve ends up with the **(C) orange** ball. 



"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* **Eve and Claire swap:** This means Eve now has the blue ball, and Claire has the yellow ball.
* **Bob and Dave swap:** Bob now has the green ball, and Dave has the brown ball.
* **Eve and Alice swap:** Eve now has the black ball, and Alice has the blue ball.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire now has the brown ball, and Bob has the yellow ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** Alice now has the yellow ball, and Eve has the blue ball.

Therefore, Dave ends up with the **(D) brown ball**.

"Let's analyze the position swaps:

Eve starts as a cheerleader and only swaps positions with Alice. Since Alice ends up as a benchwarmer, Eve must take Alice's final position, which is **(B) goalkeeper**. 



"
"Let's carefully trace the partner swaps:

* Dave starts with Patrick.
* He doesn't switch partners with anyone until Eve and him swap, meaning he ends up with Rodrigo.

"
"Let's carefully track the gift exchanges:

* **Initial:** Claire starts with the green present.
* **Key Observation:**  Notice that Claire only swaps gifts with Bob.  

Since Claire's only exchanges are with Bob, the only way she could end up with a different present is if Bob had the present she ends up with.

"By carefully tracing the ball swaps, we can determine Bob's final ball.  

Bob starts with a purple ball. He then trades with Alice, receiving her ball (which was black). Finally, he trades with Alice again, getting her current ball (which was purple). 

Therefore, Bob ends up with the **(D) purple ball**. 



"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* **Bob starts with blue, Claire with yellow.** They swap, so Bob has yellow and Claire has blue.

So the answer is **(A) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"Alice ends up with the black ball.  Here's why:

The key is to carefully follow the trades. Notice that Alice only swaps balls with Eve and Dave.  Since Eve ends up with the yellow ball (after swapping with Bob), Alice must have received the black ball from Dave. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Eve ends up with the **(E) blue present**. 



"
"After carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up with the brown present.

"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Claire's final possession.

* Gertrude and Eve swap, then swap again later. This means Eve's ball will end up back with her.
* Dave and Fred swap, and Fred swaps with Claire. This means Fred's original green ball will end up with Claire.
* Claire swaps with Alice twice. This means Claire will end up with Alice's original ball.

Alice started with the blue ball.  

Therefore, Claire ends up with the **(A) blue ball**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Claire's final position.  Claire starts as the right winger and only swaps positions with Bob.  Since they swap back with Fred later, Claire ends up back in her original position.

"
"Gertrude's position changes throughout the match are key to solving this.  Let's analyze:

* She starts as the goalkeeper.
* She swaps positions with Bob, then Dave, then Fred, then Claire.

Notice that she swaps back with Dave and Fred, meaning those swaps don't ultimately change her final position.  

Therefore, Gertrude ends up playing **center midfielder** after swapping with Claire. 

The answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* Gertrude starts with purple and swaps with Alice (green).
* Eve starts with blue and swaps with Claire (orange).

Bob starts with *The Great Gatsby* and then trades with Alice, acquiring *Hound of the Baskervilles*. He then trades with Claire, obtaining *The Fellowship of the Ring*. After trading with Alice again, he has *Ulysses* and finally ends up with *Ulysses* after swapping with Eve.


Therefore, the answer is **(D) Ulysses**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine Fred's final book.  Fred initially has Frankenstein and only trades books with Gertrude and Eve.  Gertrude starts with Lolita and Eve starts with The Fellowship of the Ring.  Since Eve ends up with Lolita after trading with Gertrude, Fred must have acquired The Fellowship of the Ring from Eve. 


The answer is **(C)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up with the yellow ball. 


The answer is **(F)**. 

"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Eve's final possession.

Eve starts with a blue ball. She then trades with Dave (red), Fred (white), Dave again (blue), and finally Alice (purple).  

Therefore, Eve ends up with the **(A) purple ball**. 



"
"Let's carefully analyze the book swaps to see where Alice's book ends up.  

Notice that Alice only participates in one swap: she trades her original book, *The Odyssey*, with Claire for Claire's book.  Since Claire ends up with *Catch-22* after swapping with Fred, Alice must have *Catch-22* at the end of the semester.


**Therefore, the answer is (E).** 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Eve's final position.  Eve begins as a cheerleader and then trades positions with Gertrude, Fred, Dave, and finally, Alice. This chain of swaps ultimately places Eve as the right winger. 

So the answer is **(D)**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Alice's final possession.  Alice starts with the orange ball and ends up with the black ball after trading with Bob in the final swap. 


The answer is **(D)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Alice ends up with the purple present. 


The answer is **(E)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Claire's final position.  Notice that Claire swaps positions with Gertrude twice, effectively canceling out those moves.  The other swaps don't involve Claire directly.  Therefore, Claire remains in her original position of **(A) fullback**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Eve's final dance partner.  Eve starts with Helga, then dances with Izzi, Karl, Sam, and finally Jamie. 


Therefore, the answer is **(E) Jamie**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Eve ends up with the white present. 


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Dave's final dance partner.  Dave starts with Rodrigo, then dances with Ophelia, then Izzi, and finally Jamie. 


The answer is **(E) Jamie**. 

"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Alice's final ball.

* Eve and Dave exchange balls.
* Gertrude and Eve swap balls.
* Bob and Fred trade.
* Claire and Fred exchange.
* Alice and Claire swap.
* Eve and Fred trade again.
* Finally, Eve and Dave swap once more.

By meticulously tracking each exchange, we find that Alice ends up with the **black** ball. 

**Therefore, the answer is (E).** 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Bob's final position.  Bob starts as the center midfielder.  He only swaps positions once, trading places with Eve, the striker.  

Therefore, Bob ends the match playing **(D) striker**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Claire's final dance partner.  

After all the switches, Claire ends up dancing with **(E) Izzi**. 



"
"Let's carefully follow Gertrude's partner changes:

* Gertrude starts with Sam.
* She then dances with Alice, Dave, Fred, and back to Alice.

Notice that none of the other partner swaps involve Gertrude. 

Therefore, Gertrude ends up dancing with **Alice**.

**Answer: (D) Lola.** 



"
"Let's carefully trace the gift exchanges to see where Alice ends up:

* Gertrude starts with yellow and swaps with Eve (brown), then Bob (blue), then Fred (white).
* Bob starts with blue, swaps with Gertrude (brown), then Alice (green), then Dave (purple).
* Alice starts with green and swaps with Bob (purple), then Claire (brown).

Therefore, Alice ends up with the **brown** present. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up with the purple present. 


The answer is **(G)**. 

"
"By carefully tracing the ball swaps, we can determine Gertrude's final ball.  Gertrude starts with the brown ball and only swaps once, with Alice.  Alice ends up with the yellow ball, meaning Gertrude must have received the blue ball. 


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Bob ends up with the brown present. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Fred's final position.  Fred initially plays fullback.  He only swaps positions once, with Alice. Since Alice ends up as fullback, Fred must have taken her original position as striker. 


The answer is **(G) striker**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Fred's final possession.  Fred only swaps balls once, exchanging his initial brown ball for Dave's white ball.  

Therefore, Fred ends the game with the **(A) white ball**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Fred's final possession.  Fred initially has the white ball. He swaps with Eve, acquiring the red ball.  He doesn't swap again until the very end, when he keeps the white ball. 


The answer is **(B) white ball**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book trades, we can determine Alice's final book.  Alice starts with *The Great Gatsby* and then swaps with Fred for *The Pearl*. She then trades *The Pearl* with Eve for *Frankenstein*. After that, she trades *Frankenstein* with Claire for *The Fellowship of the Ring*.  

Therefore, Alice ends up with **(F) The Fellowship of the Ring**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine Bob's final book.  

Notice that Bob only participates in one swap: he trades Frankenstein with Alice. Since Alice ends up with The Fellowship of the Ring, Bob must have ended up with her original book, **(G) Lolita**. 



"
"Let's carefully trace the book swaps to see where Alice's book ends up:

* **Initial:** Alice starts with Lolita.
* **Dave and Gertrude:** This swap doesn't involve Alice.
* **Claire and Bob:** This swap doesn't involve Alice.
* **Alice and Dave:** Alice trades Lolita for The Pearl.
* **Fred and Claire:** This swap doesn't involve Alice.
* **Dave and Fred:** This swap doesn't involve Alice.
* **Bob and Claire:** This swap doesn't involve Alice.
* **Eve and Fred:** This swap doesn't involve Alice.


Therefore, Alice ends up with **(C) The Pearl**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Fred's final possession.  Fred starts with an orange ball. He then trades with Bob, acquiring a purple ball.  Later, he swaps with Claire, ending up with a green ball. This green ball remains with Fred through the rest of the exchanges. 


The answer is **(A)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Eve's final position.  Eve starts as the center midfielder and then trades positions with Bob, the goalkeeper, and then with Alice, the fullback. Finally, she trades with Alice again, ending up as the benchwarmer. 


So the answer is **(C)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Bob's final position.  

Bob starts as a benchwarmer. He then swaps with Alice, becoming the left midfielder. Later, he swaps with Dave, taking on the right midfielder position.  He maintains this position through the remaining swaps.

Therefore, Bob is playing **(F) right midfielder** at the end of the match. 



"
"After carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Gertrude's final position.  Gertrude ends up playing **(D) center midfielder**. 



"
"Eve ends up playing **(F) fullback**. 

Here's why: Carefully tracking the position swaps reveals that Eve ultimately takes over the fullback position. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Alice's final position.  Alice starts as the right midfielder and then trades positions with Claire, Bob, Gertrude, and finally Eve. This means Alice ends up playing **(F) fullback**. 



"
"Let's carefully trace the book swaps to see where Fred ends up with a book.

* Eve starts with *The Odyssey* and swaps with Alice who has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* Claire, who has *Lolita*, then swaps with Alice (who now has *The Odyssey*).
* Dave and Gertrude swap *Ulysses* for *Catch-22*.
* Bob, with *Frankenstein*, swaps with Dave (who has *Catch-22*).
* Gertrude gets *Ulysses* from Dave, trading her *Catch-22*.
* Dave and Bob swap again, this time Dave getting *Ulysses* and Bob getting *Frankenstein* back.
* Finally, Fred, who has *The Great Gatsby*, swaps with Bob (who has *Ulysses*).

Following these trades, Fred ends up with *Ulysses*. 

**The answer is (E).** 



"
"By carefully tracking the partner swaps, we can determine that Eve ends up dancing with Ophelia. 

**Answer: (D)** 

"
"Eve ends up with the purple ball.  

Here's how we figure that out: The key is to carefully follow the trades.  Eve starts with the yellow ball and only trades once, swapping with Alice at the very beginning. Alice ends up with the black ball, meaning Eve must have received the purple ball in that initial exchange. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Eve ends up with the green present. 


The answer is **(E)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Alice's final position.  Alice starts as the left midfielder and then trades positions with Dave, Gertrude, Eve, and finally, ends up swapping with Eve again. This series of swaps ultimately lands Alice in the position of left winger. 


So the answer is **(A)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Dave's final dance partner.  Dave starts with Melissa, then switches with Eve, and finally ends up with Sam. 

So the answer is **(G) Melissa**. 



"
"Alice ends up with the black ball.  

Here's how we figure that out:  We need to carefully track who has what gift throughout the swaps. Since each person starts with a unique gift, we can follow the chain of exchanges to see where the black ball ends up. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Claire's final position.  

Claire starts as the center midfielder. She then swaps with Fred, becoming the left midfielder. Later, she swaps with Eve, ending up as the **left winger**. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book trades, we can determine Eve's final book.  Eve starts with Moby Dick and ends up with Frankenstein after a series of swaps. 


The answer is **(E) Frankenstein**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book trades, we can determine Alice's final book.  Alice starts with *The Odyssey* and swaps with Dave for *The Pearl*. She then trades *The Pearl* with Bob for *The Great Gatsby*, and finally trades *The Great Gatsby* with Eve for *The Fellowship of the Ring*. 


The answer is **(C)**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* Gertrude starts with blue and ends up with white after swapping with Bob, Alice, and then back with Alice.
* Bob starts with red, gets blue from Gertrude, then white from Eve, and ends with blue.
* Eve starts with white, gets black from Alice, then blue from Bob, and ends with blue.

Therefore, Eve has the **(G) blue ball** at the end of the game. 



"
"Let's carefully analyze the partner swaps to determine Fred's final dance partner.

Fred begins with Izzi. He then switches with Eve, then Gertrude, then Alice, and finally ends up with Melissa. 


The answer is **(D) Melissa**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Eve ends up with the orange ball. 


The answer is **(E)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Alice's final position.  Alice starts as the left midfielder and then trades positions with Gertrude, Eve, and finally ends up as the center midfielder. 


So the answer is **(A) center midfielder**.

* Eve and Bob exchange books.
* Eve and Claire exchange books.
* Gertrude and Alice exchange books.
* Gertrude and Claire exchange books again.
* Alice and Bob exchange books.
* Bob and Dave exchange books.
* Finally, Fred and Claire exchange books.

Tracing Claire's books through these trades, we see she ends up with **The Great Gatsby**. 


So the answer is **(A)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Bob's final dance partner.  Bob starts with Helga, then dances with Patrick, and maintains that partnership through several swaps.  The key is recognizing that Bob doesn't switch partners again after initially trading with Dave.  

Therefore, Bob is dancing with **(B) Patrick** at the end of the dance. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Eve ends up with the green present. 


The answer is **(E)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Bob's final possession.  Bob starts with a black ball. He then trades with Eve, acquiring a purple ball.  He later trades with Alice, keeping the purple ball.  

Therefore, Bob ends the game with the **(D) pink ball**. 



"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Fred's final possession.

Fred starts with a red ball.  He swaps with Bob, then with Dave, acquiring the purple ball in the process.  

The other swaps don't affect Fred's ball.

Therefore, Fred ends up with the **(C) purple ball**. 



"
"Gertrude ends up with the red present. Here's why:

The key is to carefully follow the swaps. Notice that Gertrude only swaps gifts once, with Eve.  Since Eve initially had the red present, Gertrude acquires it during this exchange. 


The answer is **(E)**. 

"
"By carefully tracing the ball swaps, we can determine Bob's final possession.  Bob initially has the yellow ball and only swaps with Eve at the very end. Since Eve had the blue ball before swapping with Bob, Bob must end up with the **(G) white ball**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book trades, we can determine Eve's final book.  Eve starts with *Frankenstein* and swaps with Alice for *The Fellowship of the Ring*. Later, she trades *The Fellowship of the Ring* with Alice for *The Odyssey*. Finally, Eve trades *The Odyssey* with Claire for *Ulysses*. 


Therefore, Eve ends up with **(B) Ulysses**. 

"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine Alice's final dance partner.  Alice starts with Melissa, then dances with Sam, Lola, and finally ends up with **(A) Rodrigo**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Fred's final possession.  Fred starts with a green ball. He then trades with Bob, Claire, and finally Claire again.  This means Fred ends up with the **green** ball. 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Alice ends up with the **(C) purple ball**. 

Here's why:  The key is to carefully track the ball movements. Notice that Fred ends up with the black ball after swapping with Alice. Since Fred had the purple ball before that swap, Alice must have acquired the purple ball. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine that Dave ends up dancing with Melissa. 

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"By carefully tracing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine that Bob ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles. 


The answer is **(G)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Claire ends up with the yellow present. 


The answer is **(D)**. 

"
"Let's carefully trace the book swaps to see where Alice's book ends up:

* Alice starts with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.
* She swaps with Eve, getting *Moby Dick*.
* She then swaps with Bob, receiving *Lolita*.
* Next, she swaps with Fred, ending up with *Catch-22*.

Alice holds onto *Catch-22* for the rest of the trades. 


So the answer is **(A) Catch-22**. 

"
"Let's carefully trace the book swaps to see where Alice's book ends up:

* Gertrude and Dave swap, but neither of them starts with Alice's book.
* Fred and Eve swap, again, no impact on Alice's book.
* Gertrude and Bob swap.  Bob now has Moby Dick, which is important to note.
* Claire and Alice swap books. This is key! Alice now has Hound of the Baskervilles.
* Eve and Claire swap. This doesn't involve Alice.
* Eve and Bob swap.  This doesn't involve Alice.
* Finally, Bob and Alice swap. Since Alice has Hound of the Baskervilles, and Bob has Moby Dick, they swap.

Therefore, Alice ends up with **(C) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Bob's final possession.  Bob starts with the blue ball and only trades with Dave and Gertrude.  Since Dave ends up with the blue ball, Bob must have the purple ball after their swap. 

The answer is **(E)**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Gertrude ends up with the **(G) yellow present**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up with the white ball. 


The answer is **(F)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up with the green present. 

**Answer: (G)** 



"
"After carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Dave ends up with the brown present. 


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Claire's final ball.  Claire initially has the black ball and only swaps with Fred. Fred ends up with the orange ball, meaning Claire must have the brown ball after their exchange. 


The answer is **(E)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Alice's final position.  Alice starts as a benchwarmer and then trades positions with Bob, Gertrude, and finally Gertrude again.  This means Alice ends up in Gertrude's original position, which was **(A) striker**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book trades, we can determine Claire's final book.  

Claire starts with *Lolita* and swaps with Gertrude, receiving *Catch-22*. She then trades *Catch-22* with Bob for *Moby Dick*.  Next, she swaps *Moby Dick* with Alice for *Ulysses*. Finally, Claire ends up with *Lolita* after swapping *Ulysses* with Alice.


So the answer is **(A) Lolita**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Bob's final position.  

Bob starts as the right midfielder. He then swaps with Gertrude, becoming the right winger. He later swaps with Dave, becoming the right winger again. Finally, he swaps with Dave one last time, ending up as the center midfielder.


So the answer is **(C) center midfielder**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Bob's final position.  

Bob starts as the striker. He swaps with Eve, becoming the benchwarmer. Later, he swaps with Alice, ending up as the goalkeeper. 


So the answer is **(E) goalkeeper**. 

"
"Alice ends up dancing with Izzi.  

The key to solving this is to carefully track the partner swaps. Notice that Alice switches partners with Eve twice, essentially undoing the first switch.  


The answer is **(C)**.
"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine Dave's final book.  Dave starts with *The Pearl* and ends up with *The Fellowship of the Ring* after trading with Bob.

The answer is **(D) Patrick**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up with the yellow present. 



"
"After carefully analyzing the series of partner swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up dancing with Lola. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine Eve's final dance partner.  Eve starts with Rodrigo, then switches with Gertrude, leaving her with Melissa.  She retains Melissa as her partner through the remaining swaps. 

Therefore, Eve is dancing with **(E) Helga**. 



"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine that Bob ends up dancing with Sam. 

So the answer is **(G)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Gertrude ends up with the **(G) red present**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Fred's final position.  Fred starts as the left winger. He swaps with Eve, then remains in his new position as Eve swaps with Claire, and Gertrude swaps with Alice.  Only when Dave and Bob swap does Fred's position change again, moving him to right midfielder.  He stays in this position through the remaining swaps.

Therefore, Fred is playing **(F) center midfielder** at the end of the match. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine that Dave ends up with Hound of the Baskervilles. 


The answer is **(C)**. 

"
"Let's carefully trace the path of Claire's book:

* Claire starts with Hound of the Baskervilles.
* She swaps with Alice, getting Lolita.
* She then swaps with Bob, receiving The Odyssey.
* Next, she swaps with Eve, ending up with Frankenstein.
* Finally, she swaps with Dave and gets Moby Dick. 


Therefore, Claire ends the semester with **(E) Moby Dick**. 

"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine Alice's final dance partner.  Alice starts with Sam, then switches with Gertrude, Bob, and finally ends up dancing with **(A) Melissa**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* Gertrude starts with purple and swaps with Alice (green).
* Eve starts with blue and swaps with Claire (orange).
* Claire now has blue and swaps with Gertrude (who has green).
* Bob starts with pink and swaps with Alice (who has green).
* Eve (orange) swaps with Alice (green).
* Dave starts with yellow and swaps with Alice (green).
* Finally, Dave (green) swaps with Fred (black).

Following these swaps, Claire ends up with the **purple** ball. 

The answer is **(G)**. 



"
"Let's carefully analyze the book swaps to determine Fred's final book.

Fred starts with *The Great Gatsby*. He then swaps with Bob, acquiring *Hound of the Baskervilles*.  He swaps again with Gertrude, ending up with *The Pearl*.  This book remains with Fred through the rest of the exchanges.

Therefore, the answer is **(A) Lolita**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Alice's final position.  Alice starts as the cheerleader and then trades positions with Bob, Claire, Gertrude, and finally Dave. This means Alice ends up in Dave's original position, which is **(B) right winger**. 



"
"By carefully tracing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine that Alice ends up with Ulysses. 


The answer is **(G)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Dave's final possession.  Dave starts with a brown ball. He then trades with Fred, acquiring a white ball.  Next, he trades with Claire, ending up with a yellow ball.  Dave doesn't trade again, so he retains the yellow ball.


The answer is **(D) yellow ball**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Fred's final possession.  Fred begins with a white ball.  He then trades with Alice, Dave, and finally Bob.  This means Fred ends up with Bob's original ball, which was **orange**. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book trades, we can determine that Fred ends up with Frankenstein. 


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* **Gertrude and Alice swap:** This doesn't affect Bob's ball.
* **Fred and Bob swap:** Bob now has the green ball.
* **Fred and Claire swap:** This doesn't affect Bob's ball.
* **Eve and Dave swap:** This doesn't affect Bob's ball.
* **Alice and Eve swap:** This doesn't affect Bob's ball.
* **Alice and Claire swap:** This doesn't affect Bob's ball.
* **Claire and Fred swap:** This doesn't affect Bob's ball.

Therefore, Bob ends up with the **(A) green ball**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Bob's final position.  

Bob starts as the cheerleader. He then swaps with Claire (right winger), Fred (goalkeeper), and finally Fred again (who is now right winger). This means Bob ends up in the position Fred started in: **(C) center midfielder**. 



"
"By carefully tracing the partner swaps, we can determine Alice's final dance partner.  Alice starts with Karl, then dances with Izzi, Claire, and finally ends up with Sam. 


The answer is **(F) Sam**. 

"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Alice's final possession.

Alice starts with the green ball and only swaps with Fred.  Fred then goes on to swap with several others, but crucially, he ends up swapping with Claire. Claire then swaps with Bob.  

Since Alice only swapped with Fred once, and Fred's later swaps don't involve Alice, Alice must have ended up with the ball Fred had *before* their initial swap.  

Fred started with the pink ball.

Therefore, Alice ends up with the **(B) pink ball**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Gertrude's final dance partner.  Gertrude ends up dancing with **(G) Melissa**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Dave's final dance partner.  Dave starts with Izzi and only switches partners with Claire.  Claire then switches partners several times, but ultimately ends up dancing with Rodrigo. This means Dave is left dancing with **(A) Lola**. 



"
"After carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Dave ends up with the **(A) blue present**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine that Gertrude ends up with the brown ball. 


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Alice ends up with the brown present. 


The answer is **(A)**. 

"
"Let's carefully analyze the gift swaps to determine Gertrude's final present.

Gertrude starts with the brown present. She swaps with Dave, receiving the yellow present.  This yellow present stays with her through the remaining swaps.

Therefore, Gertrude ends up with the **(C) yellow present**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Bob's final position.  

Bob starts as the right winger. He then swaps with Fred, becoming the right midfielder.  Later, he trades positions with Dave, ending up as the fullback. 

Therefore, the answer is **(G) fullback**. 



"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* Fred starts with the blue ball and only swaps balls with Gertrude and Eve. 
* Gertrude initially has the orange ball and only swaps with Fred.
* Eve starts with the white ball and only swaps with Fred.

This means the only way Fred could end up with a ball other than blue is if he swaps with Eve, receiving her white ball.

**Therefore, the answer is (D).** 



"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Eve's final ball.

Eve starts with a green ball.  She swaps with Alice, receiving the red ball.  Eve doesn't swap with anyone else during the game.

Therefore, Eve ends the game with the **(E) red ball**. 



"
"After carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Gertrude's final position.  Gertrude starts as the benchwarmer and only swaps positions with Alice.  Since Alice ends up as the center midfielder, Gertrude must have taken Alice's original position as the **(A) left midfielder**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine Fred's final gift.  Fred starts with the black ball and only swaps gifts with Bob and Claire.  Since Bob receives the black ball from Fred, and Claire receives the blue present from Fred, Fred must end up with the **blue present**. 

The answer is **(A)**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine Bob's final book.  

Bob starts with *The Fellowship of the Ring*. He then trades with Alice, Dave, Fred, and Claire, acquiring *The Pearl*, *The Odyssey*, and finally *The Great Gatsby*. 


The answer is **(A)**. 

"
"By carefully tracking the ball swaps, we can determine Bob's final possession.  

Bob starts with the white ball. He swaps with Gertrude, then Gertrude swaps with others several times.  Crucially, Bob swaps with Gertrude again, acquiring her ball at that point.  Since Gertrude ends up with the black ball, Bob must have the brown ball.

The answer is **(D)**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine Bob's final book.  

Bob begins with *Frankenstein*. He then trades with Claire for *Moby Dick*. Later, he trades with Alice for *The Odyssey*.  

Therefore, Bob ends the semester with **(F) The Odyssey**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine that Fred ends up with Catch-22. 


The answer is **(E)**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* **Alice and Fred:**  Fred ends up with yellow.

"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine that Claire ends up with the green ball. 

**Answer: (A)** 

"
"After carefully analyzing the sequence of position swaps, we can determine Dave's final position.  Dave starts as the cheerleader and only swaps positions with Bob. Since Bob ends up as the left winger, Dave must have taken Bob's original position as the **(B) right winger**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of book swaps, we can determine Fred's final book.  Fred initially has *Frankenstein* and only swaps books once, with Eve. Eve ends up with *Moby Dick* after a series of trades, meaning Fred must have *Ulysses* at the end of the semester.

"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Dave's final possession.

* Dave starts with a purple ball.
* He swaps with Gertrude, getting her blue ball.

The answer is **(D) Ophelia**. 

"
"Let's carefully analyze the book swaps to determine Gertrude's final book.

Gertrude starts with *The Odyssey* and only swaps books once, with Dave.  Dave ends up with several books throughout the trades, but ultimately ends up with *Frankenstein*. This means Gertrude must have received *The Pearl* in the initial swap with Dave.

Therefore, the answer is **(G) The Pearl**. 



"
"Let's carefully analyze the ball swaps to determine Gertrude's final ball.

Gertrude starts with the red ball. She swaps with Bob, then Dave, then no one, then Dave again.  Notice that the swaps with Dave essentially undo each other.  

The key is that Gertrude ends up swapping with Bob twice. Since Bob ends up with the brown ball, Gertrude must have the **orange ball** at the end.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Dave's final dance partner.  Dave ends up dancing with **(B) Izzi**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Fred's final possession.  Fred starts with a pink ball. He then swaps with Eve, acquiring an orange ball.

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Claire ends up with the blue present. 

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Eve ends up with the green present.  

Here's why:  The key is to carefully track the swaps. Notice that Eve only swaps gifts twice: once with Gertrude and once with no one. This means the only way for Eve to end up with a different present is if she swaps with Gertrude and Gertrude receives a green present at some point. Examining the swaps, we see this is exactly what happens. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of gift swaps, we can determine that Dave ends up with the white present. 


The answer is **(G)**. 

"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of partner swaps, we can determine Gertrude's final dance partner.  Gertrude ends up dancing with **(E) Lola**. 



"
"By carefully analyzing the sequence of ball swaps, we can determine Claire's final ball.  Claire starts with the brown ball. After swapping with Dave, she has the yellow ball. She then trades with Alice for the black ball, and later gets the yellow ball back from Alice.  Finally, she ends up with the yellow ball after swapping with Dave. 


So the answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Let's carefully track the ball movements:

* **Claire and Bob:**  Red and black balls are swapped.
* **Dave and Claire:** Pink and black balls are swapped.
* **Fred and Gertrude:** Blue and orange balls are swapped.
* **Fred and Eve:** White and orange balls are swapped.
* **Claire and Dave:** Pink and red balls are swapped.

* **Alice and Fred swap:** Alice now has *The Pearl*!
* **Claire and Dave swap:** This doesn't involve Alice.
* **Bob and Gertrude swap:** Alice is still holding *The Pearl*.
* **Eve and Bob swap:** Alice remains with *The Pearl*.


Therefore, Alice ends up with **(D) The Pearl**. 

"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* **Start:** Alice (Black), Bob (Brown), Claire (Blue)
* **Bob and Claire swap:** Alice (Black), Bob (Blue), Claire (Brown)
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice (Blue), Bob (Black), Claire (Brown)
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Alice (Blue), Bob (Brown), Claire (Black)

Alice ends up with the **(C) blue ball**. 



"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* **Swap 1:** Claire and Alice switch partners. This means Alice is no longer with Karl.
* **Swap 2:** Bob and Alice switch partners. Alice is now with someone new.
* **Swap 3:** Alice and Claire switch partners again. This puts Alice back with one of her original partners.

Since Alice started with Karl, and the final swap puts her back with someone she's danced with before, the answer must be (A) Karl. 



"
"Let's track the gifts:

* **Start:** Alice (blue), Bob (orange), Claire (brown)
* **Bob and Alice swap:** Alice (orange), Bob (blue), Claire (brown)
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Alice (brown), Bob (blue), Claire (orange)
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Alice (brown), Bob (brown), Claire (blue)

Claire ends up with the **(C) blue present**. 



"
"Let's break down the position changes:

* **Start:** Alice (cheerleader), Bob (right winger), Claire (goalkeeper)
* **Swap 1:** Alice and Claire switch. Now Alice is goalkeeper, Claire is cheerleader.
* **Swap 2:** Bob and Alice switch. Now Bob is goalkeeper, Alice is right winger.
* **Swap 3:** Claire and Bob switch. Now Claire is right winger, Bob is cheerleader.


Therefore, Bob ends up playing **(C) cheerleader**. 

"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* Bob starts with Lola and ends up switching partners twice. 
* Since Alice and Claire both switch partners with Bob, Lola must be Bob's final partner.


The answer is **(C) Lola**. 

"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* **Swap 1:** Alice and Bob switch partners. This means Alice ends up with Bob's original partner, Helga, and Bob ends up with Alice's original partner, Izzi.

* **Swap 2:** Alice and Claire switch partners. Now Alice has Claire's original partner, Melissa, and Claire has Alice's partner from the previous swap, Helga.

* **Swap 3:** Bob and Alice switch partners.  Bob ends up with Alice's partner from the previous swap, Melissa, and Alice ends up with Bob's partner from the previous swap, Izzi.

Therefore, at the end of the dance, Bob is dancing with **(B) Melissa**. 



"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* Bob and Alice switch partners, so Alice is now with Melissa and Bob is with Sam.
* Then, Bob and Claire switch, meaning Claire is now with Sam and Bob is with Jamie.
* Finally, Bob and Alice switch again. This puts Alice back with Jamie and Bob back with Melissa.

Therefore, Claire ends up dancing with **(C) Sam**. 



"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* Claire ends up dancing with whoever Alice was dancing with at the very beginning, since they switch partners in the final step.
* Alice started with Izzi. 

Therefore, Claire ends up dancing with **(C) Izzi**. 



"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* Claire starts with Izzi and switches partners twice, meaning she'll end up with someone new.
* Bob also switches partners twice, so he'll also end up with a new partner.
* Alice switches partners once, meaning she'll end up with a new partner.

Since Alice only switches once, and Claire switches partners with both Bob and Alice, Alice must end up with Claire's original partner, Sam. 


The answer is **(C) Sam**. 

"
"Let's track the ball movements:

* **Start:** Alice (Red), Bob (Orange), Claire (Black)
* **Alice & Bob swap:** Alice (Orange), Bob (Red), Claire (Black)
* **Alice & Claire swap:** Alice (Black), Bob (Red), Claire (Orange)
* **Claire & Bob swap:** Alice (Black), Bob (Black), Claire (Red)

Alice ends up with the black ball. 

**(A)** 



"
"Let's analyze the ball swaps:

* **Swap 1:** Alice and Claire exchange balls.
* **Swap 2:** Bob and Claire exchange balls.
* **Swap 3:** Alice and Claire exchange balls again.

Since Claire swaps with both Alice and Bob, and the final swap is with Alice, Claire ends up with the ball she started with. 

Therefore, Claire has the **(A) blue ball**. 



"
"Let's track the books as they move between friends:

* **Start:** Alice has *Ulysses*, Bob has *Catch-22*, Claire has *Moby Dick*.
* **Claire and Alice swap:** Alice now has *Moby Dick*, Claire has *Ulysses*.
* **Claire and Bob swap:** Claire now has *Catch-22*, Bob has *Moby Dick*.

Claire ends up with the yellow present. 

**(A)** 



"
"Let's track the books:

* **Swap 3:** Claire and Bob exchange books again. Claire ends up with *Lolita* and Bob ends up with *Hound of the Baskervilles*.


So the answer is **(C) Hound of the Baskervilles**. 

"
"Let's track the books as they change hands:

* **Alice and Claire swap:** Alice now has *The Great Gatsby*, and Claire has *The Fellowship of the Ring*.
* **Alice and Bob swap:** Alice now has *Frankenstein*, and Bob has *The Great Gatsby*.

Therefore, Bob is dancing with **(B) Izzi** at the end of the dance. 

"
"Let's break down the position changes:

* **Start:** Alice (Fullback), Bob (Cheerleader), Claire (Left Winger)

Considering these exchanges, Claire ends up with the yellow ball. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* Alice and Bob switch partners first.
* Then, Bob and Claire switch.

Think about it like this: Bob ends up switching partners twice. Since he starts with Lola, and switches partners twice, he'll end up back with Lola. 


The answer is **(B) Lola**. 

"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* Bob starts with Melissa.
* He switches with Alice, then Claire, and then back to Alice.  

This means Bob ends up back with his original partner, Melissa. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Let's break down the partner swaps:

* **Swap 1:** Alice and Claire switch partners. This means Alice is no longer with Sam.
* **Swap 2:** Alice and Bob switch partners. Now Alice is with someone new again.
