"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  The pianist is either in the first or third house because they're one house away from the flutist.

The lilies have to be to the left of the carnations, and the tulips have to be to the left of the guitarist.

If the pianist was in the first house, there wouldn't be room for the tulips to be left of the guitarist. So the pianist must be in the third house. That means the lilies are in the second house, and the carnations are in the fourth.

This leaves the tulips to be in the first house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.

Here's what I think:

* **Clue 5** tells us the person who likes green lives in the first house.
* **Clue 8** says the kiwi eater is also in the first house. So, the first house has someone who likes green and eats kiwis.

Now, **clues 1, 2, and 3** are all about the order of the root beer lover, the TV owner, and the water drinker. It seems like it has to go TV - Water - Root Beer.

**Clue 4** says the cellist and the gameboy player live with one house between them.  And **clue 6** says the blue lover and the gameboy player are right next to each other.

Putting it all together, I think the cellist must live in **house number 3**. 


So the answer is **(C)**.
"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... we need to figure out where the person who likes green lives. There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I think the best way to do this is to start with the clues that give us specific house numbers. Like, we know the person who eats kiwis lives in house number 5 and the tennis player is also in house number 5.

Then we can look for clues that tell us who lives next to who.  

It's gonna take some time to work through all of this, but I'm gonna give it a shot!  

... *Starts scribbling on a piece of paper* ...

Okay, I think I got it!  The person who likes green lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

I'd start by making a little chart to keep track of everything. Like, one column for each house and then rows for drinks, food, shoes, and cars.

Then I'd go through the clues one by one and see if I can fill anything in. Some clues are easier than others. Like, clue 9 says the person in house 1 eats apples. Boom, done!

It's like a puzzle, you gotta figure out how the clues fit together.  

After going through all the clues a few times, I think I got it! The tea drinker lives in **house 2**. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house. That's a pretty straightforward clue!

So the answer is **(A) 5**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things:

* There's a soccer player, a basketball player, and a swimmer.
* Someone's eating a banana, someone's eating mangos, and someone's eating oranges.
* There are tulips, lilies, and daffodils in the houses.

Here are the clues:

1. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

Hmm... let me see...

If the daffodil person is to the right of the orange eater, and the soccer player is to the left of the orange eater, then it has to go: Soccer Player - Orange Eater - Daffodil Person.

And since the swimmer is next to the daffodil person, it's: Soccer Player - Orange Eater - Swimmer - Daffodil Person.

But we also know the tulip person is to the right of the mango eater.  So the full order must be: Mango Eater - Tulip Person - Soccer Player - Orange Eater - Swimmer - Daffodil Person.

That means the daffodil person lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a puzzle!

We have three houses and three people, and we need to figure out who lives where based on what they like.

Here's what I'm thinking:

* **Clue 7 is a big help:** The violinist lives in the first house. That's one down!

* **Clue 1 says** the spaghetti eater isn't in the second house.

* **Clue 2 and 3** seem to be about the percussionist. The fried rice eater is to their right, and the daffodils are to their left.

* **Clue 4** tells us the mystery book reader is to the left of the science fiction fan.

* **Clue 5** is tricky - the radio and history book buff have a house between them.

* **Clue 6** says the tulips and the phone are right next to each other.

* **Clue 8** says the history buff is to the right of the tulips.

Hmm, it's a lot to keep track of! I'd probably draw a little chart to help me.  I'd write down the houses (1, 2, 3) and then list all the things (instrument, flowers, book, lunch, device) and try to fill them in as I figure things out.

Let me think... I'm going to need to use all the clues together to figure out where the tulips are. 




"
"Okay, let's break this down.  We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live in them.

Here's what I think:

* We know the bird person doesn't live in the first or last house, so they must be in the middle house.
* The mystery book reader also lives in the middle house.
* The history buff has to be next to the lilies, so they must be in the first house.

Now, the gameboy person is right next to the roses, so they must be in the first house too!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this sounds like a fun puzzle! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

The best way to do this is probably to make a little chart. Like, one column for each house, and then columns for fruit, pet, gadget, and flowers.

Then we gotta use the clues to fill it in. Some clues are easier than others. Like, clue 8 says the horse person is in house number 3. Boom, done!

We can use that clue and others to figure out the rest. It's like a puzzle where each clue gives you a piece.

I'm gonna grab a pen and paper and see if I can crack this!

...

*Thinking hard*

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person with the phone lives in **house number 4**. So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things:

* One person wears sandals, the other boots.
* One person likes mysteries, the other history books.
* One person drives a convertible, the other a truck.

The clues tell us:

1. The convertible driver lives to the left of the history buff.
2. The boots wearer doesn't live in the first house.

So, if the convertible is in the first house, the history buff must be in the second house.  And since the boots wearer can't be in the first house, they must be in the second house. That means the person wearing sandals has to be in the first house!

**Answer: (A) 1** 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The golfer lives in the first house.
* The swimmer lives right next to the romance book lover, and they can't be in the third house.
* The mystery book reader is right next to the history book buff.
* The basketball player doesn't live in the last house.

Thinking about this, the swimmer and romance reader have to be in houses 2 and 3.  Since the mystery reader is next to the history buff, they can't be in the last house either. That means the basketball player must be in the third house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"The mystery book reader lives in house number **3**. Clue number 3 tells us that straight up! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know there are three houses and each person has a different gadget and a favorite color.  

Here's what we know for sure:

* Green lives right next to the person with the Gameboy.
* The Gameboy person lives right next to the person with the computer.
* Yellow isn't in the middle house.

Thinking about this, the only way it can work is if:

* House 1: Green
* House 2: Gameboy
* House 3: Computer

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a little puzzle!

We have four houses and need to figure out who lives where based on their favorite color, drink, and type of book.

Here's what I'm thinking:

* The root beer lover is in house number 3.
* The person who likes red also lives in house number 3.

Now, the coffee drinker has to be to the right of the person who likes green. And there are two houses between the white lover and the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker can't be in houses 1 or 2.

Since the history buff isn't in house 4 and the romance lover isn't in house 1, and the romance lover is right next to the history buff, the only place they can be is in houses 3 and 4.

That means the coffee drinker must be in house 4!

**So the answer is (B).** 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The fantasy book person lives in house number 1.
* The pizza eater doesn't live in house number 1.
* The green lover lives right next to the radio person.

Since the fantasy book person is in house 1, and the pizza eater isn't, the pizza eater must be in house 2.  That also means the green lover is in house 1 and the radio person is in house 2.

We also know the fish person doesn't live in house 1, so they must be in house 2.

That leaves house 1 for the cat lover!


**Answer: (A) 1**
"
"This puzzle is tricky!  It's like a big game of connect-the-dots with people and their stuff.  

The best way to figure it out is to make a chart with columns for each thing: house number, pet, book, lunch, color, and drink. Then, you gotta go through each clue and fill in the chart. Some clues are easy, like ""the dog owner lives in the second house."" Others are harder, like ""the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue."" You gotta think about what that means for the whole chart.

Keep going through the clues, and you'll start to see how everything fits together. It's like a puzzle where each clue is a piece!

Good luck!  I bet you can crack it. 



"
"Okay, let's see... the person eating kiwis lives in the first house because clue number 8 says so directly. 

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we need to figure out where the person who ate stew lives.  

It looks like we have a lot of clues about who lives next to whom and what they're eating and what flowers they have.  I'm going to try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House Number* | *Fruit* | *Lunch* | *Flowers*
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        |         |         |         
2        |         |         |         
3        |         |         |         
4        |         |         |         
5        |         |         |         

Alright, let me start plugging in the clues and see if I can figure this out.  

... *Starts scribbling on paper, muttering to herself* ...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person who had stew lives in **house number (D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have four houses and four people, each with a different pet and a different flower. Here's what we know:

* The cat lover is in the first house.
* The tulips are right next to the dog owner.
* The daffodils aren't in the second house.
* There's one house between the horse owner and the carnations.
* The lilies are somewhere to the right of the horses.

If we think about it, the only way all these clues fit is if the fish enthusiast is in the last house. 

So the answer is **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the phone is in house number 1.  And the boots aren't in house number 2, so they must be in house number 1 too.

That means the person with the radio and the person with the horses have to be in houses 1 and 2.

Since the boots are in house 1, the high heels have to be in house number 2.


So the answer is **(A) 2**. 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  It's like a puzzle!

I think the best way to solve this is to write down everything we know.

* We need to figure out who likes green, and what house they live in.

* There are clues about shoes, favorite colors, fruit, lunch, and what kind of device each person has.

* Some clues tell us things are next to each other, like the grilled cheese and computer person.

* Other clues say things can't be together, like the pizza person can't be in the second house.

I'm going to start by writing down all the clues and then try to see if I can figure out where everyone lives.  It might take a few tries, but I'll get there!

... *Starts scribbling on a piece of paper* ...

Okay, after going through all the clues, I think the person who likes green lives in **house 3 (C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have four houses and four people, each with a different sport and pet. Here's what we know:

* The basketball player isn't in the first house and is to the left of the swimmer.
* The baseball player is in the second house.
* The fish enthusiast is to the right of the dog owner.
* The bird keeper isn't in the first or third house.
* The tennis player is right next to the cat lover.

Thinking it through, the basketball player has to be in the third house, and the swimmer in the fourth. That means the tennis player and cat lover are in the first two houses. Since the bird keeper can't be in the first or third house, they must be in the fourth house!

So the answer is **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle, we gotta figure out who likes what, drives what, and plays what sport.

Hmm, looking at the clues...

* The person with the computer is somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
* The baseball player and the person who likes blue live next to each other.
* The sedan is right next to the SUV.
* The swimmer lives to the right of the SUV.
* The violinist doesn't live in the first house.
* The sedan and the Gameboy are right next to each other.
* The guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white.

Ugh, so many clues! I'm gonna try drawing it out, maybe that will help.

...

Okay, after drawing it all out and trying different combinations, I think I got it!

The soccer player lives in **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so the question is asking which house the person who ate grilled cheese lives in.  

Looking at the clues, clue number 11 says ""The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.""

So the answer is **(E) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a puzzle!

We have three houses and three people, each with different stuff.  

Here's what I think:

* **The clues are key:** They give us hints about who lives where and what they have.

* **Start with the obvious:** We know the pianist isn't in the first house. And the person with oranges is to the right of the person with kiwis.

* **Think about pairs:** Some clues tell us things are next to each other, like the high heels and the pianist.

* **Fill in the blanks:** As we figure things out, we can start filling in the grid.

* **Double-check:** Make sure everything fits together!

After going through all the clues carefully, I think the person with the television lives in **house 4**. 

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  

It's like a puzzle where we need to figure out who lives where based on what they like and what they drive.

I'd probably start by making a little chart to keep track of everything.  Then I'd go through each clue carefully and see if I can fill anything in.

Some clues seem more helpful than others. For example, knowing the apple eater is in house number three is a good starting point.

It's going to take some time and careful thinking, but I bet we can crack this!

...

*Thinking hard*

...

Okay, I think I got it! After going through all the clues, I figured out that the person who owns the sedan lives in **house number 4**. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know a few things for sure:

* The kiwi eater is in house number 1.
* The truck isn't in house 3, and neither is the SUV.
* The truck also isn't in house 1.

That means the truck has to be in house 2!  And since the SUV isn't in house 1 or 3, it must also be in house 2.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the fried rice eater is in the third house.  And the spaghetti eater is right next to them, so they must be in the second house.

The swimmer is in the first house, and the cricketer isn't in the third house, so they must be in the first or second house.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  It's like a puzzle!

I'm going to try to figure out where the person wearing boots lives.

Hmm, let me see... the clues say the truck is to the right of the boots, and the loafers are to the left of the truck.  Also, the person who likes blue lives in the last house.

Oh, and the person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

I think I need to draw a little diagram to keep track of everything...

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person wearing boots lives in house **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so the history book buff has to live in house number 1 because clue 2 says so. 

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues to keep track of.

I think the best way to do this is to make a chart with all the houses and then try to fill in the blanks using the clues.

It's going to take some time to figure out where everyone lives and what they like, but I'm up for the challenge!

... *starts scribbling on a piece of paper* ...

Hmm, let me see...

* The soccer player is in the first house, that's a good start.
* And the kiwi eater is in the third house.

Okay, now I need to see which clues I can use to figure out more.

*  The fantasy book person is to the right of the swimmer...

*  The stew eater is to the left of the grape eater...

This is like a big puzzle! I'll keep working on it and see if I can figure out where the apple eater lives.

... *continues scribbling and muttering to themselves* ...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

We have three houses and three people, each with different stuff.  Here's what I figured out:

* **House 2 is key:** We know the history buff lives there, and they also have daffodils.

* **House 3 is easy too:** The person there wears loafers.

* **Yellow and boots are buddies:** They live right next to each other. Since yellow can't be in house 1 or 3, it must be in house 2, and boots are in house 1.

* **High heels in house 1:**  The blue lover is to the right of the high heels, and house 3 has loafers, so high heels must be in house 1.

* **Putting it all together:**

    * House 1: Boots, High Heels, Green, Science Fiction
    * House 2: Daffodils, Blue, Yellow, History
    * House 3: Loafers, Lilies 

So the answer is **(A) 1**. The green lover lives in house 1. 



"
"Okay, so the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. That's a pretty straightforward clue! 

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the cricketer lives in the first house.  The person with the truck has to be to the right of the basketball player.  And the horse person is right next to the sedan person.

Thinking it through, the basketball player can't be in the last house because the truck person has to be to their right.  That means the basketball player has to be in the middle house!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they have.  

My best bet is to draw a little chart with the houses numbered 1 to 5 and then make columns for each thing: device, pet, instrument, car, and flower.

Then I'd start plugging in the clues. Some of them are pretty straightforward, like the one that says the radio is in the fourth house.  Others are trickier, like the ones that say things are ""to the left"" or ""to the right"" of each other.

I'd have to think carefully about those and maybe even draw little arrows on my chart to keep track.

It's gonna take some time, but I bet I can figure it out!

Oh, and the question is asking for the house number where the tulips are, right?  I'll keep an eye out for that! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle, we gotta figure out who lives where based on what they wear, drive, eat, and drink.

Hmm, looking at the clues...  

* The person with running shoes is in house number 2.
* The milk drinker is in house number 3.

Let me see... *thinks hard*

Aha!  The clue about the sedan and the water drinker being two houses apart is key.

I think the sedan owner lives in house number **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down! This is like one of those logic puzzles we used to do in math class.

We have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live in them.  

Here's what I'm thinking:

* **Start with the knowns:** We know the saxophonist is in house number 2 and the tea drinker is in house number 4.

* **Connect the clues:**  The cellist is right next to the tea drinker, so the cellist must be in house 3.

Let me see...

* **More connections:** The person who had pizza is to the right of the saxophonist, so they must be in house 3 or 4.

* **Putting it together:** Since the cellist is in house 3, and the person who had pizza is either in 3 or 4, the cellist must have had pizza!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  It's like a puzzle!

I'm going to try to figure out where the truck driver lives.

Hmm, let me think...

* The minivan is in the last house, and the root beer lover is in the third house.
* The basketball player is right next to the truck driver.
* The lilies and daffodils are next to each other.

Oh! And the swimmer is to the left of the sedan owner.

I'm going to need to think about this some more...

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The truck driver lives in house **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have three houses and three people, each with different likes. Here's what we know:

* **House 1:** The tea drinker lives here.
* **Apples and Minivan:** The apple eater lives to the left of the minivan driver.
* **Sci-Fi and Convertible:** The convertible driver lives to the right of the science fiction fan.
* **Fantasy and Coffee:** The fantasy book lover and the coffee drinker live one house apart.
* **Oranges:** The orange eater doesn't live in the second house.

Let's think about it... if the apple eater is to the left of the minivan, and the minivan is in the last house, the apple eater must be in the middle house.  That means the coffee drinker can't be in the last house because they have to be one house away from the fantasy book lover.

So, the coffee drinker must be in the **second house (B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know there are three houses and each person has a favorite color and a favorite type of book.  

Here's what we know for sure:

* The red lover is in the middle house (house number 2).
* The mystery book reader is in the last house (house number 3).

We also know:

* The white lover isn't in the last house.
* The fantasy book lover isn't in the first house.

That means the fantasy book lover has to be in the first house! 

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the SUV owner lives in.  

Looking at the clues, clue number 5 says straight up that the SUV owner lives in the **third house**. 

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we need to figure out where the root beer lover lives.  

It's like a puzzle where we have to match up all these clues about people and their stuff.  

I'd probably start by drawing three boxes, one for each house, and then write down all the clues. Then I'd try to see if any clues tell me something for sure about a specific house.

It's going to take some careful thinking, but I bet we can crack this! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a puzzle!

We have four houses and four people, each with different tastes in books, fruit, and shoes.  We need to figure out where the science fiction fan lives.

Here's what we know:

* The history buff lives right next to the fantasy fan.
* The science fiction fan lives to the right of the fantasy fan.
* The running shoes guy is right next to the apple eater.
* The apple eater isn't in the third house.
* The mango eater is right next to the sandals wearer.
* There's one house between the apple eater and the boots wearer.
* The fantasy fan is in the third house.
* The banana eater is to the right of the fantasy fan.

Hmm, let me see...

If the fantasy fan is in the third house, and the science fiction fan is to their right, then the science fiction fan must be in the fourth house!


So the answer is **(B) 4**. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a bunch of stuff about these two people: what they ate, their instruments, shoes, favorite colors, and cars.  

Here's what I figured out:

* The fried rice eater doesn't live in the first house.
* The SUV owner doesn't live in the second house.
* The flutist lives right next to the person who likes white.
* The loafer wearer lives right next to the person who likes white.

Using these clues, I can tell that the person wearing sandals must live in **House 2 (B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down! This is like one of those logic puzzles we used to do in math class.

We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

Here's what I'm thinking:

* **Clue 4 is a big one:** The root beer lover is in house number 3.
* **Clue 3 tells us:** The water drinker doesn't live in house 1.
* **Clue 1 says:** The water drinker and minivan owner are neighbors.

So, the water drinker must be in house 2 and the minivan owner in house 3.

Now, let's see... the sedan is to the left of the daffodils, and the sedan is also to the left of the apples, which are to the left of the violinist. That means the order has to be: Sedan - Daffodils - Apples - Violinist.

I think the violinist must live in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... we need to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.  There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be organized.

I'd probably start by writing down all the clues and then making a chart with the houses numbered 1 to 5. Then I'd try to fill in the chart using the clues.  

Some clues are easier than others. Like, we know right away that the person who likes yellow lives in house number 3. And the person with high heels is in house number 2.

It's like a puzzle, we just gotta keep piecing it together!

I'm gonna need some time to work on this one.  Lots of thinking involved! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the person with the TV lives in house number 1 because Clue 2 says so.  And Clue 1 tells us the lilies aren't in house number 1. That means the person with the lilies must be in house number 2.

Since house 1 has the TV, house 2 has to have the computer.

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have two houses, and we need to find out where the percussionist lives. Here's what we know:

* **Food:** One person ate pizza, the other ate spaghetti.
* **Flowers:** One has tulips, the other has daffodils.
* **Books:** One likes history, the other likes science fiction.
* **Sports:** One plays baseball, the other plays golf.
* **Music:** One plays guitar, the other plays percussion.

And here are the clues:

1. The science fiction fan lives to the left of the golfer.
2. The pizza eater and history buff live next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives to the right of the daffodils.

Hmm... let's see.  If the guitarist is to the right of the daffodils, and the daffodils can't be in the second house (because the golfer has to be to the right of the science fiction fan), then the daffodils must be in the first house. That means the guitarist is in the second house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  It's like a puzzle!

I'm going to try drawing it out, maybe with a little chart.  

* House 1:  
* House 2:
* House 3:
* House 4: Violinist
* House 5: Bird Keeper

Okay, so the violinist is in house 4 and the bird keeper is in house 5.  

Hmm, let me see... the clues about the gameboy, guitarist, and TV being near each other are important. And the fish person and horse person live next to each other.

*Thinking really hard*

I think I got it! The percussionist lives in house number 2.


So the answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Okay, let's see... we've got two houses and two people.  

We know a few things for sure:

* House 1 has lilies.
* The basketball player isn't in House 1.

The clues tell us the radio person is to the right of both the apple eater and the violinist. That means the violinist can't be in House 2, because the radio would have to be in House 3, and there isn't one!

So, the violinist must be in House 1. 


**Answer: (A) 1**
"
"Okay, let's break this down.  We have five houses and five people, each with a different sport and lunch. Here's what we know:

* The tennis player is in house number 3.
* The grilled cheese eater is in house number 5.
* The golfer is in house number 4.

We also know that fried rice and spaghetti can't be in houses 1 & 2 or 4 & 5 because they have to be next to each other.  

The pizza eater is somewhere to the left of the cricketer, and the stew eater is right next to the spaghetti eater.  Finally, the tennis player is to the left of the soccer player.

Hmm... thinking about all this, I'm going to say the cricketer lives in house number **(B) 2**. 


Let me know if you want to try another one!
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know two people live in houses numbered 1 and 2.  They each have different favorite foods, colors, drinks, sports, and shoes.

Here's what we can figure out:

* The person with running shoes doesn't live in house 1.
* The person who likes white lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti.
* The baseball player and the spaghetti eater are neighbors.
* The person who drinks only water lives next to the spaghetti eater.

Thinking it through, if the baseball player and spaghetti eater are neighbors, and the water drinker is also next to the spaghetti eater, they must all be in a row. Since the running shoes aren't in house 1, the person in house 2 must be wearing them.

That means the person in house 1 must be wearing loafers.

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know there are three houses and each person has a different fruit and drink.  Here's what I'm thinking:

* The coffee drinker has to be in house 1 because they live to the left of the mango eater, and the mango eater can't be in house 2.

* Since the root beer lover isn't in house 2, and the orange eater isn't in house 2 either, the mango eater must be in house 2.

* That leaves house 3 for the root beer lover and the water drinker.

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know:

* House 1 has the spaghetti eater.
* The fried rice eater isn't in House 2.
* The boots person is right next to the fried rice person.
* The loafers person isn't in House 1.

Thinking it through... if the fried rice person isn't in House 2, and the boots person is next to them, the fried rice person must be in House 3 and the boots person in House 2.

That means the loafers person has to be in House 2.

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

The best way to do this is probably to make a chart. Like, one column for each house and then rows for the car, food, fruit, book, and device each person has.

Then we gotta go through each clue and see if we can fill anything in. Some clues are easier than others. Like, clue 11 says the science fiction fan lives in house number 3. Boom, we got that one!

We just gotta keep going through the clues, one by one, and see if we can figure out where everyone lives and what they like. It might take a while, but we can do it!

Oh, and the question is asking where the mystery book reader lives, right?  I'll keep an eye out for that! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle where we need to figure out who lives where based on what they wear, their pets, what they drink, and the flowers they have.

I'm going to try to keep track of everything in my head, but it might help to draw a little chart.

* The dog owner is in the third house, that's a good starting point.
* And the root beer lover is in the fifth house.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues about things being next to each other.  We need to think about that carefully.

Let me think... think... think...

Okay, I'm going to go with **(E) 4** as the house where the person with the lilies lives. 



"
"Okay, so we know a few things:

* One person likes mysteries and the other likes fantasy books.
* One person plays tennis and the other plays golf.

We also have these clues:

* The mystery reader lives in house number 1.
* The tennis player doesn't live in house number 1.

That means the tennis player must live in house number 2.  Since the mystery reader is in house 1, the fantasy book lover has to be in house 2.


**Answer:** (B) 2 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we need to figure out where the person who likes white lives.  

There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.  I think the best way to do this is to start with the most obvious clues and see if we can build from there.

Hmm, let me think...

...

Okay, I think the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... we need to figure out where the person who drinks only water lives.  

It seems like we have a lot of clues about different people and their likes and dislikes.  We need to see if we can find a clue that directly tells us about the water drinker or a clue that helps us eliminate some houses.

Hmm, I'm going to need to think about this one for a bit and maybe draw a little chart to keep track of everything.  

*Thinking hard*

Okay, I think I need more time to figure this out.  Can I come back to this later? 



"
"Okay, so the first clue tells us that the person who likes red lives in the first house.  

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see...

It's like a big matching game. We need to figure out who lives where and what they have.  I'd probably start by writing down all the clues and then trying to connect them.

For example, we know the swimmer lives in the fourth house, and the person with running shoes is in the first house.  

Hmm, I'd need to keep going through the clues and see if I can figure out where everything else goes. It might take a while, but I bet I can crack it!

Oh, and the question is asking about the lilies... I'll keep an eye out for that! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* House 1 has the kiwi eater.
* House 2 has the science fiction fan.

Since the bird keeper and high heel wearer are neighbors, they must be in house 2.  The tennis player and apple eater are also neighbors, so they must be in house 2 as well.

That means the dog owner has to be in house 1, and the cricketer must be the one left over, living in **house 1**.


So the answer is (B) 1. 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we need to figure out where the grape eater lives.  

It looks like we have a lot of clues about who lives where and what they like.  We'll have to use all of them to figure this out.

Hmm, I think the best way to do this is to start writing down everything we know. Maybe make a little chart with the house numbers and then fill in the blanks as we go.

*House Number* | *Pet* | *Lunch* | *Sport* | *Fruit*
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        |          |          |          |          
2        |          |          |          |          
3        |          |          |          |          
4        |          |          |          |          
5        |          |          |          |          

Alright, now let's see... there are clues about who lives next to who, and what they eat. We need to put it all together like a puzzle!

...

*After some time spent working through the clues*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person eating grapes lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  It's like a puzzle!

We need to figure out where the pizza eater lives.  

Hmm, let me think... I'd probably start by making a little chart to keep track of everything. Like, a column for each house and then rows for the car, lunch, flowers, fruit, and favorite color.

Then I'd go through the clues one by one and see if I can fill anything in.  Some clues are easier than others. Like, we know right away that the person who likes green lives in the first house.

I'd keep going through the clues, looking for anything that tells me about the pizza eater.  It might take a while, but I bet we can figure it out!

Oh, and don't forget to double-check your work! It's easy to make a mistake when there's so much information.



Let me know if you want to try working through some of the clues together!
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things:

* One person eats grapes, the other eats mangos.
* One person drives a convertible, the other a minivan.
* One person plays cricket, the other baseball.

The clues tell us:

1. The grape-eater doesn't live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The convertible driver lives in the second house.

Since the baseball player and convertible driver are both in the second house, they're the same person.  That means the grape-eater must be in the first house, and the mango-eater must be in the **first house (A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The blue lover is in the middle house (house number 2).
* The apple eater is right next to the orange eater.
* The kiwi eater is in the last house.
* The white lover is to the right of the green lover.

Since the kiwi eater is last, and blue is in the middle, the green lover must be in the first house. That means the white lover is in the last house!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The houses are numbered 1 and 2, with someone living in each.
* Each person has different likes and hobbies.

The clues are key here:

* Clue 1 tells us the root beer lover is in the house to the right of the rose bouquet.
* Clue 2 says the soccer player is right next to the mystery book reader.
* Clue 3 says the gameboy owner is somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

Thinking it through, if the rose bouquet is in House 1, then the root beer lover must be in House 2.  That means the gameboy is in House 1, and the mystery book reader is in House 2.  

So, the rose bouquet is in **House 1 (A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have four houses in a row, and each person has a different pet and car. Here's what we know:

* The minivan person lives to the right of the fish person.
* There are two houses between the truck and the dog person.
* The truck is right next to the sedan.
* The fish person is right next to the dog person.
* The cat person doesn't live in the second house.

Let's think about it like this:

Since the truck is next to the sedan, and the minivan is to the right of the fish person, the order can't be truck-sedan-fish-minivan. That means the minivan has to be in the last house.

We also know the fish person is right next to the dog person, and there are two houses between the truck and the dog person.  That means the order has to be truck-sedan-fish-dog-minivan.

And since the cat person can't be in the second house, they must be in the first.

So the dog person lives in house number **3**. 


The answer is (C).
"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the root beer lover is in the second house, and the yellow lover is in the third.  The clue about blue being to the right of yellow means blue must be in the fourth house. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we need to figure out where the bird keeper lives.  

It's like a puzzle where we have to match up all these clues about people and their stuff.  

Hmm, I'd probably start by writing down all the clues and then trying to see if any of them tell me something definite about a specific house.  

Like, maybe one clue says someone who likes a certain color lives in a certain house, or something like that. Then I could go from there.

I'm gonna need to think about this one for a bit! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle where we have to figure out who lives where based on what they eat, their hobbies, and stuff like that.

I'd probably start by making a little chart to keep track of everything.  Then I'd go through the clues one by one and see if I can fill anything in.

Some clues are easier than others. For example, we know right away that the person with horses lives in the first house.

It's going to take some time to figure out where the tennis player lives, but I bet we can do it! 

Let me think about it for a bit... 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... we need to figure out where the history book buff lives.  

It's like a big matching game. We have to figure out who plays what sport, eats what fruit, likes what book, and their favorite color.  

There are a lot of clues, so we have to be careful and see how they all fit together. I'm going to try drawing it out on paper to keep track of everything.

... *scribbles furiously on paper*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things:

* One person plays guitar, the other cello.
* One has a computer, the other a Gameboy.
* One has a dog, the other has fish.

The clues tell us:

1. The cello player lives right next to the Gameboy owner.
2. The dog owner doesn't live in the first house.

Thinking about this, the only way it works is if the cello player and Gameboy owner are in house number 2, and the dog owner must be in that house too. 


So the answer is **(B) 2**.
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The gameboy person is in house number 3.
* The minivan person is in house number 1.

Now, the phone person is right next to the SUV person, and the radio person is somewhere to the right of the gameboy person.  That means the SUV can't be in house 1, and the radio person must be in house 4.

Since the SUV isn't in house 1 and the phone is to its left, the SUV has to be in house 2!


So the answer is (D) 2.
"
"Okay, let's break this down.  We have five houses and we need to figure out where the person with the carnations lives.

Here's what we know:

* **Flowers:** Tulips, lilies, carnations, roses, and daffodils - each house has one.
* **Devices:** Gameboy, phone, computer, radio, and television - each house has one.

And here are the clues:

1. Lilies are to the right of the phone.
2. The phone is right next to the television.
3. Tulips are in the third house.
4. Daffodils are to the right of the radio.
5. Daffodils aren't in the fourth house.
6. The computer is in the second house.
7. Roses are right next to carnations.

Hmm, let me see...

Okay, so the tulips are in the third house, and the computer is in the second.  The phone and TV have to be together, and the lilies have to be to the right of the phone.  The daffodils and radio are also together, but the daffodils can't be in the fourth house.

Thinking about it, the only way all of this fits is if the carnations are in the fifth house! 


So the answer is **(E) 5**.
"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It looks like the key is to figure out where things are relative to each other. For example, we know the cricketer is in the second house, and the golfer is in the fourth.  

We also know the bird keeper is in the first house, and the fish enthusiast is in the second house.

Hmm, let me think...

Oh! The person wearing sandals lives one house away from the bird keeper, so they must be in the third house.

And the baseball player is to the right of the sandals wearer, so they must be in the fourth or fifth house.

The cat lover is to the right of the golfer, so they must be in the fifth house.

Now, let's see... the clue about the loafers and the cricketer being next to each other means the loafers must be in the first house.

That leaves the running shoes. They can't be in the fourth or fifth house, so they must be in the second house.

Finally, the only thing left is the dog owner.  They must be in the third house!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know two people live in separate houses, and they have different preferences for drinks, food, cars, and devices.  Here's what we can figure out:

* **Clue 1 and 4** tell us the radio and truck are together, and the grapes and computer are together. They could be in either order.
* **Clue 2** says the radio is to the left of the pizza eater. This means the pizza eater can't be in the first house.
* **Clue 3** says the root beer lover isn't in the first house either.

Putting it all together, the pizza eater must be in the second house!

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have four houses and four people, each with different food, color, and drink preferences.  Here's what we know:

* **House 1:** The tea drinker lives here.
* **House 2:** The pizza eater lives here (because they're right next to the tea drinker).

Now, think about the other clues:

* Milk comes before spaghetti, and spaghetti comes before water.
* White and water are right next to each other.
* Coffee comes before yellow.
* Green isn't in house 1, and neither is grilled cheese.

If you play around with the order, you'll find that the only place green can fit is in **house 3**. 


So the answer is **(B)**.
"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live in them.  It's like a puzzle!

I'm going to try to keep track of everything in my head.

* The dog person lives in the third house, and the person who likes water lives to their right.
* The person who likes white also lives in the third house.
* The horses are in the last house.
* The minivan is right next to the sandals.

Hmm, this is tough.  Let me think...

* Oh! The person who likes red lives somewhere near the SUV.

Okay, I think I've got it!  

The person who likes **red lives in House 2**.


So the answer is **(C)**.
"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see...

It's like a big matching game. We need to figure out who lives where and what they like. I'd probably start by making a chart with the houses numbered 1 to 5 and then list all the things we need to match up: drinks, fruits, shoes, sports, and flowers.

Then I'd go through each clue carefully and see if I can fill anything in directly. Some clues seem more helpful than others. Like, clue 4 says the running shoes are in house number 3, so I can write that down right away.

I'd keep going through the clues, looking for connections and trying to figure out who lives next to whom. It might take a while, but I bet we can crack this!

Oh, and the question asks for the house number with the lilies.  I'll keep an eye out for that! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the soccer player is in house number 3.  And the tulips aren't in house 3.  

The golfer is right next to the basketball player, so they have to be in houses 1 and 2.

The lilies are to the left of whoever ate grilled cheese.  Since the grilled cheese can't be in house 1 (there's nothing to the left of it), it has to be in house 2!


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know the saxophonist doesn't live in the fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth. The pianist is in the third house, and the person who ate fried rice is also in the third house.  

Since the pianist and the fried rice eater are in the same house, the answer must be **(D) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and four people, each with different shoes, lunches, and drinks.  

The clues give us some hints about where things are.  Like, the tea drinker is in the third house, and the stew eater is somewhere before the spaghetti eater.

We also know the root beer lover is to the right of the sandals wearer, and the water drinker is to the right of the grilled cheese eater.

Oh, and the grilled cheese eater isn't in the first house.

Hmm... I think we need to try different combinations and see if they fit all the clues. This is going to take some careful thinking!

Let me see...

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person wearing running shoes lives in house **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  It's like a puzzle!

I think the best way to solve this is to make a chart. We'll list the houses (1 through 4) and then write down all the things we know about each house: what shoes they wear, their favorite drink, what gadget they have, their sport, and what they ate for lunch.

Then we gotta use the clues to fill in the chart. Some clues are easier than others. For example, we know the radio is in house number 3, and the basketball player is in house number 4.

We also know the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are both in house number 3.

It's gonna take some careful thinking to figure out the rest, but I bet we can do it!

Let me think for a bit...

...

Okay, I think I got it! After looking at all the clues and filling in the chart, I figured out that the computer is in **house number 2**.


So the answer is **(B)**.
"
"Okay, so we know two people live in separate houses, and they each have different lunches and favorite book types.  

The clue tells us the fried rice eater lives to the right of the science fiction fan. That means the science fiction fan can't be in the house on the right. 

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the pianist lives in the first house.  And the person who likes root beer lives to the right of the horse owner. That means the horse owner can't be in the second house.

Also, the person who likes white doesn't live in the second house either.

So, the horse owner must be in the first house, and the dog owner has to be in the second house.


**Answer: (B) 2** 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

* We know the stew person is in house number 2, and the pizza person is in house number 4.

* The percussionist has to be to the right of the science fiction fan, and the history buff is to the right of the percussionist. That means they're probably in houses 3 and 4.

* The guitarist is to the left of the violinist, so they're probably in houses 1 and 2.

* Oh, and fried rice is two houses away from the fantasy book lover.

Let me see... I think I got it!

The percussionist must live in **house 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live in them.

Here's what I think:

* We know the person who likes white lives in the first house.
* The person with daffodils lives next to the person who likes white.
* Horses live next to daffodils.

That means the horses must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* Someone in house 3 is eating apples.
* The coffee drinker can't be in house 2.
* The coffee drinker lives right next to the milk drinker.
* The mango eater is right next to the apple eater.

Thinking it through, if the coffee drinker isn't in house 2, they must be in house 1, which means the milk drinker is in house 2.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know a few things for sure:

* The science fiction fan lives in the middle house (house number 2).
* The first house has carnations.

Now, let's think about the other clues:

* The person with loafers and the person who likes red live right next to each other.
* The person who likes white lives right next to the person with tulips.
* The history buff is somewhere to the right of the tulips.

Hmmm... this means the tulips can't be in the last house because the history buff needs to be to their right.  

Let's try putting the tulips in the second house. That would mean the person who likes red is in the third house, and the person with loafers is in the first.  But wait, the person with boots can't be in the last house!

So, the tulips must be in the first house, the person who likes red is in the second house, and the person with loafers is in the third house. That means the boots must be in the second house!


**Answer: (C) 2**
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The water drinker is in the first house.
* The lilies are in the second house.

That means the milk drinker has to be in the third house because there has to be a house between the water drinker and the milk drinker.

Since the lilies are in the second house, the tulips must be in the first house.

That leaves the third house for the roses! 


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  

It's like a puzzle, we gotta figure out who lives where based on what they wear, their favorite color, what gadget they have, and their sport.

Hmm, looking at the clues... the person with the loafers is in the first house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the third house and plays tennis.  

Oh! And the person with the phone is right next to the person with the radio.

Let me think...  I'm gonna need to draw this out to keep track of everything.

*scribbles on a piece of paper*

Aha! I think I got it!  The cricketer lives in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we need to figure out who lives in which house.  

Clue 4 says the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have three houses and three people, each with different stuff.  Here's what I'm thinking:

* **Clue 1** tells us the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person with the TV.
* **Clue 2** says the golfer doesn't live in the middle house.
* **Clue 3** is tricky - the computer person and the tulips are right next to each other.
* **Clue 4** says the radio person is to the right of the roses.
* **Clue 5** also talks about the radio being to the right of the TV.

Hmm, so the TV has to be before the radio, and the roses have to be before the radio too.  That means the order has to be TV, then radio, then roses.

And since the computer and tulips are together, let's try putting them in the first house.

That leaves the golfer and the tennis player. The golfer can't be in the middle house, so they must be in the first house with the computer and tulips. That means the tennis player must be in the second house with the TV.

So, the computer person is in **house 1 (A)**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It looks like the key is to figure out who lives where step by step. We know the swimmer is in the third house, the violinist is in the second, the cricketer is in the fourth, and the daffodils are in the fifth house.

Hmm, there are also clues about who lives next to whom. The basketball player and baseball player are next to each other, and the guitarist is somewhere near the carnations.

Oh, and the sandals are right next to the tulips!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  

...

Okay, after looking at all the clues, I think the person wearing sandals lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the person in house number 2 ate grilled cheese.  And since the person with high heels lives next to the fish enthusiast, the high heels must be in house number 1, and the fish person in house number 2.

That means the stew eater has to be in house number 1!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  We need to figure out where the cat lover lives.

I'm going to try making a little chart to keep track of everything.

* **House 1:**  
* **House 2:** Horses
* **House 3:** Fish
* **House 4:** Tulips, Red
* **House 5:** Romance

Alright, so we know a few things for sure. The romance lover is in the last house, horses are in the second house, and the fish enthusiast is in the third. The tulips are in the fourth house, and whoever likes red lives there too.

Hmm, let me look at the clues again...

Oh! The person who likes blue lives next to the history buff, and the mystery book reader is right before the blue lover.  

And the person who likes yellow lives somewhere before the lilies, and the lilies are before the bird keeper.

This is getting complicated!

Wait a minute... the person who likes white lives next to the horses, so white must be in the first house!

Okay, I think I'm starting to see a pattern here...

After going through all the clues carefully, I figured out that the cat lover lives in **House 1**.



So the answer is **(A) 1**.
"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

It looks like the key is figuring out where the oranges are.  

* We know the person with grapes lives next to the person with oranges.
* We also know the person with oranges lives to the right of whoever wears boots.

Hmm, let me think...

Aha! The flutist lives in the third house, and the person with running shoes also lives in the third house.  That means the person with the phone must be in the third house too!

Since the person with running shoes is next to the science fiction fan, and the romance fan is to the left of the science fiction fan, the romance fan must be in the first house.

Okay, now I'm starting to get it!

Let me keep going...

...

Alright, I figured it out! The person eating oranges lives in **house 2 (B)**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we need to figure out where the person eating apples lives.  

There are a lot of clues, so it's like a puzzle. We need to think about who lives next to who and what they like.

I'm going to try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House Number* | *Color* | *Lunch* | *Fruit* | *Drink*
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        |          |          |          |          
2        |          |          |          |          
3        |          |          |          |          
4        |          |          |          |          

Alright, let me see...  I'm going to start by looking for clues that tell me things are right next to each other.

Hmm, I think I've got it!  

The answer is **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  

It's like a puzzle, we gotta figure out who lives where based on what they eat, wear, read, and drive.

I'm gonna try to keep track of everything in my head, but it might help to draw it out on paper.

*  The convertible is in the first house, that's a good start.

*  Hmm, the person who likes science fiction is somewhere to the right of the stew eater...

*  And the truck is right next to the mystery reader...

This is gonna take some thinking! I'll keep going through the clues and see if I can figure out where the pizza eater lives. 

...

Okay, after going through all the clues carefully, I think the answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know the mystery book reader is in house number 4 and the saxophonist is also in house number 4. That means the house to the left of the saxophonist, house number 3, must be the violinist!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know a few things for sure:

* The TV is in the last house (house number 4).
* Loafers are in the second house.
* The phone isn't in the second house.
* Boots are somewhere to the left of the loafers, meaning they must be in the first house.
* There are two houses between the radio and the sandals.

Thinking it through, if the radio and sandals are two houses apart, the only way that works is if the radio is in the first house and the sandals are in the third. That leaves the gameboy for the third house!

So the answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we need to figure out which house the person wearing high heels lives in.  

Let's look at the clues:

* Clue 1 says the high heels person is in the second house.

That's all we need! 

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's think this through.

We know two people live in separate houses, and they each like different types of books and wear different shoes.

Clue one tells us the loafer-wearer doesn't live in the first house. That means they must live in the second house! 

Clue two says the mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house, so they must be in the first house.


So the answer is (B), the person wearing loafers lives in house number 2. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down!  

It's like a little detective game. We have four houses and we need to figure out who lives where and what they have.

Here's what I'd do:

* **Write it out:** I'd make a list for each thing: flowers, devices, shoes, and lunch. Then, I'd write down the clues next to them.

* **Look for connections:** Some clues tell us things are right next to each other. Like, clue 1 says the running shoes person and the Gameboy person are neighbors.

* **Start filling in:**  Clue 2 says pizza is to the left of sandals. Clue 4 says tulips are to the left of pizza. So, it's like a little chain: tulips, pizza, sandals.

* **Keep going:** Use all the clues like puzzle pieces.  It takes a bit of time, but you can figure out where everything goes!

After going through all the clues, I think the person who had pizza lives in **house number 3**. 


So the answer is **(B)**.
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the houses are right next to each other, so figuring out who lives where is like a little puzzle.

* We know the mango eater is in house number 1.
* The saxophonist can't be in house number 1, so they must be in house number 2.
* The roses have to be to the left of the lilies, meaning the roses are in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2.

That means the person eating apples has to be in house number 2! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we've got this puzzle about five houses and people with different stuff.  

Let's see... the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. That's clue number 5.

So the answer is **(E) 4**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things:

* There are three houses, and each person has different flowers and a different car.
* The tulips aren't in the third house.
* The SUV is right next to the lilies.
* The sedan and roses are right next to each other, and the roses aren't in the second house.

Hmm... let me see...

If the roses aren't in the second house, and they have to be next to the sedan, then the roses must be in the first house and the sedan in the second.

That means the SUV is in the second house and the lilies are in the third.

That leaves the tulips for the second house and the truck for the third house.

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see... we need to figure out where the milk drinker lives.  

It looks like we have a lot of clues about who lives where and what they like.  We'll have to use all of them to figure this out.

I'm going to try making a chart to keep track of everything.  It might take a while, but I think I can solve it!

... *Starts scribbling on a piece of paper* ...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and four people, each with different likes and things.  

It's like a puzzle where we have to figure out who lives where based on the clues.

I'm going to try to keep track of everything in my head.

* The yellow lover is in the first house, and they're eating kiwis.
* The convertible is in the last house.

Hmm, let me think...

* The cricketer is somewhere before the convertible, so they can't be in the last house.

* The SUV isn't in the second or third house.

* The soccer player isn't in the last house either.

This is tough! I need to think about the fruit and colors more carefully.

* The banana eater is right next to the person who likes white.

* The swimmer is somewhere before the white lover.

* The mango eater is before the orange eater.

Okay, I think I'm starting to get it!

Let me see...

* The SUV is next to the banana eater, and also next to the blue lover.

* There's one house between the swimmer and the cricketer.

I'm going to keep going over the clues and see if I can figure out where everyone is.

...

*Thinking intensely*

...

Aha! I think I got it!  

The basketball player lives in house **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The green lover lives in the third house.
* The yellow lover lives right next to the green lover.
* Stew-eater is right next to the romance reader, and stew can't be in the last house.

That means the stew-eater must be in the first house, and the romance reader is in the second.  Since green is in the third house, yellow has to be in the second house.

This leaves blue for the first house!

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!  

We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live in them.  It's like a puzzle!

Here's what I think:

* **Clue 1** tells us the tulip person and the bird person are neighbors.
* **Clue 4** says the yellow lover is in the last house.
* **Clue 7** says the carnations are in the first house.

Let's try putting those in:

| House | Flowers      |
|-------|--------------|
| 1     | Carnations   |
| 2     | Tulips       |
| 3     |              |

* **Clue 5** says the horse person and the rose person are neighbors, and they can't be in the first two houses. So they must be in houses 2 and 3.

* **Clue 6** says the blue lover lives next to the horse person.

Now it's looking like this:

| House | Flowers      | Color   |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1     | Carnations   |         |
| 2     | Tulips       | Blue    |
| 3     | Rose Bouquet | Yellow  |

* **Clue 2** says the percussionist is one house away from the truck driver.

* **Clue 3** says the sedan is right next to the fish person.

Putting it all together, I think the bird person is in **house 2 (B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the fantasy book person lives in house number 1 and plays the cello.  That means the person in house number 2 must be the mystery book reader.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle seems tough!  Let's see... I'm going to try making a chart to keep track of everything.

Okay, so we have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

Hmm, some clues seem more helpful than others. Like, knowing the mango eater is next to the orange eater is a good start. And the baseball player being next to the grilled cheese person is useful too.

I'm gonna start by writing down those clues and see if I can figure out anything else from there.  

*grabs a pen and paper and starts scribbling*

This is gonna take some time... 

...

Okay, I think I've got it! After going through all the clues carefully, I figured out where everyone lives.  

The swimmer lives in house number **(D) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the golfer lives in the middle house (house number 2) and the history buff lives in the first house.  That means the swimmer has to be in either the first or third house.

Since there has to be another house between the swimmer and the science fiction fan, the swimmer can't be in the first house.  

So the swimmer must live in **house number 3**. 


**Answer: (C)** 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  

It's like a puzzle where we need to figure out who lives where based on what they eat, their hobbies, and what they like to read.

I'm going to try to keep track of everything in my head, but it might help to draw a little chart.

*House 1*  *House 2*  *House 3*  *House 4*

Hmm, let me think...  

Okay, I'm going to start by looking for clues that tell me exactly where someone lives.  

Aha! Clue number 8 says the bird keeper lives in the third house. Let's put that down:

*House 1*  *House 2*  *Bird Keeper*  *House 4*

Now, let's see if any other clues can help us. This is going to take some thinking!

...

*After some more thinking and working through the clues*

...

Okay, I think I've got it!  

The person who had stew lives in **House 2**. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's see... we've got two houses and two people.  

We know they each like different things:

* One ate fried rice, the other spaghetti.
* One loves cats, the other horses.
* One reads history books, the other romance novels.
* One wears sandals, the other running shoes.

The clues tell us:

1. The sandal-wearer lives to the left of the horse owner.
2. The history buff lives to the right of the spaghetti eater.

Hmm...  

Thinking about the clues, it seems like the person who ate spaghetti could be in either house.  We don't have enough info to know for sure where the fried rice eater lives.


So the answer is:  We can't tell! 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things:

* The houses are numbered 1 and 2.
* One person has lilies, the other daffodils.
* One person plays the flute, the other the saxophone.
* One person has a convertible, the other a sedan.

The clues tell us:

1. The sedan owner lives to the left of the person with lilies.
2. The flutist doesn't live in house number 1.

Hmm... if the sedan is to the left of the lilies, the lilies can't be in house 1. And since the flutist isn't in house 1 either, the lilies must be in **house 2**.


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, let's break this down!

It's like a little detective game. We have four houses and we need to figure out who lives where based on what they like.

Here's what I think:

* We know the rose bouquet is in the third house.
* And the carnations are in the fourth house.

That means the daffodils must be in the second house, right? Because there has to be one house between the daffodils and the roses.

Now, the mystery book reader has to be in the first house because the swimmer is one house away and the fantasy book lover is right next to the swimmer.

That means the romance book lover has to be in the fourth house because they are two houses away from the mystery book reader.

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  It's like a detective game!

I'm going to try making a chart to keep track of everything.  

* House 1:  
* House 2:
* House 3: Coffee Drinker
* House 4:
* House 5: Milk Drinker

Okay, so the coffee drinker is in house number 3 and the milk drinker is in house number 5. That's a good start!

Now I need to figure out where everyone else lives and what they like. This is going to take some serious thinking!

... *starts scribbling on paper, muttering to herself* ...

Hmm, the clues about the flowers and instruments are going to be important.  

... *continues working for a while* ...

Aha! I think I got it!  

The person with the vase of tulips lives in **house number 4**. 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!  

We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live in them.  It's like a puzzle!

Here's what I think:

* We know the minivan is in the last house, and the golfer lives in the first.

* The person with boots lives right next to the minivan, so they must be in the middle house.

* The person with the rose bouquet can't be in the middle house, and the pizza eater isn't in the middle either.

* The cricketer is right next to the tulips, so they must be in the middle house and the tulips are in the last house.

* The person with running shoes can't be in the first house.

* The grilled cheese eater is to the right of the sedan owner.

Putting it all together, I think the rose bouquet is in the **first house (A)**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one! Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle where we have to figure out who lives where based on what they like to eat, drink, play, and their favorite color.

I'm going to try to keep track of everything in my head, but it might help to draw a little chart or something.

*Looks around for a piece of paper and a pen*

Okay, I think I can do this!

*Starts scribbling on the paper*

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, we know the saxophonist lives in the third house. And the flutist is in the second.

*Continues muttering to themselves, working through the clues*

This is tricky! There are so many connections between the clues.

*After a while of intense concentration*

Aha! I think I got it!  The percussionist lives in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and five people, each with a favorite color and a different lunch.  We need to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

There are a bunch of clues, so let's look at them one by one.

* Clue 7 is a good starting point: the fried rice eater is in house number 3.

Now we gotta think about the other clues and see how they fit with the fried rice being in house 3. It's like a puzzle!

...

*Thinking hard*

...

Okay, after going through all the clues carefully, I think the person who likes white lives in **house number 1**. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The red lover lives in house number 3.
* The percussionist is in house number 2.

The violinist has to be to the right of the basketball player, and the basketball player has to be to the right of the tennis player.  

Thinking about that, the basketball player can't be in house 3 because the violinist has to be to their right.  That means the basketball player must be in house 2!


So the answer is (C) 2. 

"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

The best way to do this is probably to make a chart or something to keep track of everything.  Like, one column for each house and then rows for flowers, instruments, drinks, and devices.

Then we gotta go through each clue and see if we can figure out where things go. Some clues are easier than others. Like, clue number one says the computer is right next to the root beer lover. That's a good starting point!

It's gonna take some time to work through all the clues, but I bet we can crack this.

...

*After some time spent working on the puzzle*

Okay, I think I got it!  The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

My best bet is to start making a list and crossing things off as we go.  

* We know some things are right next to each other, like the saxophonist and the science fiction fan.
* And some things can't be together, like the fish person and the romance reader.

I'm gonna grab a piece of paper and start writing everything down.  Hopefully, we can figure out where everyone lives and what they like!

...

*Looks intensely at scribbled notes for a few minutes*

Okay, I think I got it!  The minivan is in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they have.  

I'm going to try making a chart to keep track of everything.

* House 1: 
* House 2: Dog Owner
* House 3: Fish Enthusiast
* House 4:
* House 5:

Hmm, the dog owner is in house #2 and the fish enthusiast is in house #3.  

Let me see... the clues say the minivan isn't in house #3, and it's to the right of the dog owner. So it must be in house #4 or #5.

Oh, and the computer is next to the truck, and the tulips are next to the convertible.  

This is getting complicated! I need to keep going through the clues and see if I can figure out where everything fits.

...

*Looks intensely at the clues for a while, scribbling on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!

The person with the vase of tulips lives in **house #4**. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know a few things for sure:

* The basketball player and the saxophonist are the same person and live in house #1 because they both have to be in the first house.
* The cricketer is in house #2 because the tea drinker is to their left.
* The person who had pizza is in house #1 and the dog owner is in house #2 because they have to be next to each other.

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, let's see... we have two houses and two people.  

We know a few things for sure:

* The history buff is in house number 1.
* The cat lover isn't in house number 2.

That's a good start!

Then we have these clues:

* The high heels are to the left of the daffodils.
* The loafers are to the right of the computer.

Hmm... that means the high heels must be in house 1 and the daffodils in house 2. And the computer is in house 1, so the loafers are in house 2.

Let's see... if the history buff is in house 1 and the cat lover isn't in house 2, then the cat lover must be in house 1. That leaves the fish enthusiast in house 2.

So, the lilies have to be in house 1!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  

It looks like we need to figure out where the pizza eater lives.  

Hmm, there are a lot of clues about food, flowers, and instruments. I'm going to have to make a chart or something to keep track of it all.

*grabs a piece of paper and starts drawing a table*

Okay, I've got a table with columns for each house and rows for the different things: flowers, instruments, fruit, and lunch.

Now, let's see... Clue 1 says the apple eater is in house number 3.  And clue 4 says the fried rice eater is right next to them. So, fried rice must be in house number 4.

*starts filling in the table*

This is going to take some time, but I think I can crack this!

...

*after a while of scribbling and muttering*

Aha! I think I got it!  

The pizza eater is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a big matching game. We need to figure out who likes what color, plays what instrument, and what they had for lunch, all based on these clues.

I'm going to try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  

*House 1* | *House 2* | *House 3* | *House 4*

Okay, let me start plugging in the clues and see if I can figure out where the cellist lives.  

...

*Thinking hard and scribbling on paper*

...

Aha! I think I got it!  The cellist lives in **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things:

* There's a violinist, a flutist, and a pianist, each in a different house.
* There's someone eating kiwis, grapes, and oranges, also each in a different house.

Here are the clues:

1. The pianist and kiwi eater are neighbors.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There's one house between the grape eater and kiwi eater.
4. There's one house between the violinist and kiwi eater.

Hmm... let me see...

If the pianist and kiwi eater are neighbors, and the violinist is somewhere to the left of the kiwi eater, the violinist can't be in the last house. That means the violinist must be in house 1, the kiwi eater in house 2, and the pianist in house 3.

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the person in house 1 eats kiwis.  And we know the fantasy book lover doesn't live in house 1. That means they have to be in house 2.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...  

We need to figure out which house the person who likes red lives in.  Looking at all the clues, we can see that clue number 8 tells us straight up that the person who likes red lives in the **third house**. 

So the answer is **(D) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know two people live in separate houses, one's a pianist and the other a cellist. One loves root beer, and the other loves tea.

The first clue tells us the root beer lover doesn't live in the second house. That means they must live in the first house.

The second clue says the pianist lives to the left of the cellist. Since the houses are right next to each other, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist in house 2.


So the answer is (A) 1.
"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have five houses and five people, each with different shoes and flowers.  Here's what we know:

* **Boots and Carnations are neighbors:** Clue 1 tells us these two are right next to each other.
* **Tulips are left of Loafers:** Clue 2 gives us this order.
* **Sandals aren't in the last house:** Clue 3 rules out the fifth house for sandals.
* **Running Shoes and Lilies are separated by one house:** Clue 4 means they can't be right next to each other.
* **Tulips are right of Daffodils:** Clue 5 tells us this order.
* **Tulips aren't in the fourth house:** Clue 6 narrows it down.
* **Carnations are in the last house:** Clue 7 gives us a definite placement.

Let's see... if Carnations are in the fifth house, then Boots must be in the fourth (clue 1).  Since Tulips are left of Loafers and not in the fourth house, they must be in the third house, with Daffodils in the first and Running Shoes in the second. That means Lilies have to be in the third house!

**So the answer is (C) 3.** 



"
"This puzzle is tricky, but I think I can figure it out!  

It's like a big game of connect-the-dots with all these clues. We need to figure out who lives where based on their favorite things and hobbies.

Let's see... there are a lot of clues about who lives next to whom.  We need to use those to start filling in the blanks.

Hmmm... I'm going to grab a piece of paper and draw a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House Number* | *Instrument* | *Color* | *Sport* | *Fruit* | *Drink*
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1       |          |          |          |          |          
2       |          |          |          |          |          
3       |          |          |          |          |          
4       |          |          |          |          |          

Okay, now I can start plugging in the clues and see what happens!

...

*After some time spent working on the puzzle*

I think I got it! The pianist lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  We have three houses and three people, each with different food, color, and shoe preferences.

Here's what we know:

* **White, Green, Red:** Each person likes one of these colors.
* **Spaghetti, Fried Rice, Stew:** Each person ate one of these for lunch.
* **Boots, Running Shoes, High Heels:** Each person wears one type of shoe.

Now, let's look at the clues:

1. No high heels in the last house.
2. The white lover lives in the first house.
3. Spaghetti eater isn't in the second house.
4. The green lover lives in the second house.
5. Boots are right next to high heels.
6. Boots are somewhere to the left of the stew eater.
7. The stew eater isn't in the second house.

Hmm... let me see...

Since the white lover is in the first house and the green lover is in the second, and boots are next to high heels, the boots must be in the first house and the high heels in the second.

That means the stew eater must be in the third house!

Since spaghetti can't be in the second house, the fried rice eater must be there!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know there are four houses and each person has different flowers and likes a different type of book.  

Here's what we can figure out:

* The rose bouquet is in house number 2.
* The science fiction fan lives next to the rose bouquet, so they must be in house 3.
* The romance book lover is to the right of the carnations, and also right next to the tulips. This means the tulips are in house 4 and the romance book lover is in house 3.
* Since the fantasy book lover is to the left of the science fiction fan, they must be in house 1.

That leaves house 4 for the lilies!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down. We know the science fiction fan lives in house number 1 because that's what the clues tell us.  The coffee drinker has to be in house 1 too, because they live to the left of the person wearing sandals. That means the person in house 2 must be wearing sandals and loves romance books.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we know there are two houses, and each person inside is different. One's a pianist, one's a drummer, one has a radio, and one has a phone.

The clue says the drummer lives right next to the person with the radio.  That means the drummer must be in house 1, and the radio is in house 2.

Since they each have something different, the person in house 1 must have the phone.

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the convertible is in the middle house because the clue says so.  That leaves us with the yellow and white lovers and the sedan and minivan owners.

The clue about the white and sedan people being one house apart means they can't be in the first and last houses. So, they must be in houses 1 and 3.

Since the yellow lover is right next to the sedan owner, the yellow lover has to be in house 1! 


So the answer is (A).
"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle where we need to figure out who lives where based on their shoes, cars, and pets.

I'm going to try to keep track of everything in my head.

* We know the person in the first house wears running shoes.
* The third house has a sedan.
* The dog owner can't be in the third house.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues about where things are *relative* to each other.  Like, the sandals are somewhere to the left of the bird keeper, and the fish enthusiast is to the right of the SUV owner.

I'm going to need to think really carefully about the order of everything.

...

Okay, after going through all the clues a few times, I think I've got it!

The person who owns horses lives in house **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we need to be organized.

I'd start by making a chart with the houses numbered 1 to 5 and then list all the things we need to figure out: flowers, cars, fruit, pets, and shoes.

Then I'd look for clues that tell us exactly where something is. Like, clue 5 says the convertible is in the first house.  And clue 9 says the loafers are in the second house.

After that, I'd look for clues that connect things. For example, clue 2 says the loafers are next to the person eating kiwis.

It's like a puzzle, we just have to put all the pieces together!  I'd keep going through the clues, filling in the chart as I go.

Eventually, we should be able to figure out where the truck is parked! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the fried rice eater is in the second house, and they also like fantasy books.  The spaghetti eater has to be in the first house because they're to the left of the fried rice eater. That means the science fiction fan is in the first house too.

This leaves the third house for the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater. 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so we know there are two houses, and one has tulips and the other has carnations. One person has a dog and the other has horses.

The clue says the carnations are to the left of the dog owner.  Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, that means the carnations must be in house number 1. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the kiwi eater is in house number 2.  And the water drinker is right next to the high heel wearer.  Since the kiwi eater is in house 2, the high heel wearer must also be in house 2.

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things about the people in these houses:

* They each have different stuff - one has a TV, one has a phone, one wears sandals, one wears high heels, one likes tea, one likes water, one eats kiwis, and one eats grapes.

* The clues tell us how these things are connected:

    * High heels are somewhere to the left of sandals.
    * Grapes and sandals are right next to each other.
    * The tea drinker is to the left of the person with the TV.

Thinking about this, the only way these clues can work is if:

* House 1: High heels, Grapes, Sandals
* House 2: Tea drinker, TV

Since the person with the TV can't be eating grapes or wearing sandals, and they can't be the tea drinker, they must be eating the kiwis!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.  The violinist can't be in the last house, and the water drinker lives to the right of the cellist.  Since the violinist and guitarist have to have a house between them, the violinist has to be in the first house and the guitarist must be in the third house.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We know a few things for sure:

* The person in the third house wears sandals and likes milk.
* The tea drinker is in the fifth house.
* The person who drinks water lives right next to the person wearing sandals.

Since the water drinker is next to the sandals, they must be in house number 4. 


So the answer is (B). 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a little puzzle!

We have five houses and five people, each with a different gadget and a different lunch.  

Here's what I'm thinking:

* The pizza person is in house number 4 because that's just told to us.
* Since the grilled cheese person is right next to the spaghetti person, and we know pizza is in house 4, the grilled cheese must be in house 3 and spaghetti in house 4.

* The gameboy and computer have to be next to each other, and the computer can't be in house 4. So, maybe the gameboy is in house 1 and the computer is in house 2?

* The radio can't be in house 4, and it has to be one house away from the grilled cheese, so it must be in house 2.

* The TV has to be to the left of the phone, and the only spots left are house 5 for the TV and house 5 for the phone.

* That means the fried rice person must be in house 3, right next to the gameboy.

So, the spaghetti person is in **house 4**. 


The answer is (A).
"
"This puzzle is tricky, but we can figure it out!  

The best way to do these is to make a chart.  Write down the numbers 1 through 5 for each house. Then make columns for Instrument, Sport, Fruit, Pet, and Lunch.

Now, let's look at the clues. Some of them tell us exactly where someone lives, like the tennis player being in house number 1. Others give us hints about who lives next to each other. We can use those hints to fill in the chart.

Keep going through all the clues, and eventually, you'll be able to figure out who eats the banana and what house they live in! 

Good luck! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know two people live in separate houses, and they're pretty different! One plays percussion, the other guitar. One had pizza, the other grilled cheese. One has a dog, the other a bird.

The clues tell us:

1. The grilled cheese eater lives to the right of the bird owner.
2. The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm... so if the percussionist isn't in house number 2, they must be in house number 1.  That means the guitarist is in house number 2.

Since the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird owner, the bird owner must be in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater in house 2.

That means the pizza eater must be in house 1!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"Okay, let's see... the bird keeper lives in the third house. That's because clue number 2 says so directly! 

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  It's like a puzzle!

We need to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives.  

Hmm, looking at the clues, it seems like the key is figuring out who lives where first.  

Let me think... the cat lover is in the first house, and a bunch of things can't be in the second house.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House 1*  *House 2* *House 3*

Cat Lover

...

Okay, now I need to use the clues about the pets, instruments, fruit, shoes, and books to fill in the rest. This is going to take some time!

... *thinking hard* ...

Alright, I think I got it!

The science fiction book fanatic lives in **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The grape eater is in house number 2.
* Red and green are next to each other, and white is next to red with one house in between.
*  There's one house between white and the banana eater.
* Green is to the left of yellow.

Thinking about this, the only way it works is if the kiwi eater is in house 1.  That way, red and green can be in houses 3 and 2, white is in house 1, and the banana eater is in house 4.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The running shoe person lives to the right of the orange eater.
* The mystery book reader lives right next to the cat lover.
* The mystery book reader and the stew eater are neighbors.

Since the running shoe person has to be to the right of the orange eater, and the mystery book reader and stew eater are neighbors, the stew eater can't be in the second house.  That means the stew eater must be in the first house.

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have three houses and three people, each with different stuff. Here's what I figured out:

* The person who drinks water lives in the middle house (house number 2) because that's what the clues tell us.
* The root beer lover is in the first house.
* The daffodils are in the second house, and the phone is in the third house because they have to be next to each other.
* The tulips have to be in the first house because the TV is in the third house and has to be to the right of the tulips.

That means the milk drinker must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  

It's like a puzzle! We need to figure out who lives where based on what they wear, drink, eat, and what gadget they have.

I'm gonna try drawing it out, like a chart, to keep track of everything.

*House 1*  *House 2*  *House 3*

Hmm, let me think... the loafers guy is in the first house, that's a good start.  And the phone person is somewhere before the mango eater...

This is gonna take some serious thinking!  I'll need to look at all the clues carefully and see if I can connect them.

...

*After some time spent working on the puzzle*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The computer is in **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

We have three houses and three people, each with a sport, a type of flower, and a pet.  Here's what we know:

* The golfer doesn't live in the last house, and neither does the cricketer.
* The person with the fish lives somewhere before the person with the horses.
* The golfer and baseball player live right next to each other.
* The carnations and horses are right next to each other too.
* Carnations are to the left of the baseball player.
* Roses are to the left of daffodils.

Let's think about this... if the golfer and baseball player are together, and the carnations are to the left of the baseball player, that means the golfer must be in the second house and the baseball player in the third.

Since the carnations and horses are together, and the horses have to be after the fish, the horses must be in the third house and the carnations in the second.

That means the roses have to be in the first house, and the daffodils in the second.

Putting it all together, the person with the horses lives in **house 3 (A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The person in the first house eats oranges.
* The person in the third house owns horses.

The truck has to be next to the convertible, and the mango eater and convertible driver are neighbors too.  

Since the horses are in the last house, the truck has to be in the second house so it's next to the convertible.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.

Hmm, looking at the clues...  the percussionist is to the left of the stew eater, and to the right of the mystery book reader.  

Oh! And the guitarist is right next to the percussionist.

Let me think... I'm gonna try drawing it out.

*draws a bunch of stick figures and scribbles*

Aha! I think I got it! The percussionist lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... we need to figure out where the mango eater lives.  There are a lot of clues, so it's like a puzzle.

I'd probably start by making a chart with all the houses and then try to fill in the blanks using the clues.  

It's going to take some time to work through all the clues, but I bet we can crack it!

...

*Thinking hard*

...

Okay, I think I got it!  The person eating mangos lives in house **(A) 5**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  

I'm going to start by writing down all the clues and then try to see if I can connect them.

* The percussionist and guitarist live next to each other.
* The cellist doesn't live in the fifth house.
* The person with the television lives right next to the person who likes red.
* There's one house between the guitarist and the person who likes yellow.
* There are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist.
* The person with the phone lives somewhere to the right of the person with the gameboy.
* The person who likes green lives in the third house.
* The percussionist lives right next to the person who likes white.
* The person who likes red doesn't live in the second house.
* The person with the radio lives in the third house.
* The person with the computer doesn't live in the second house.
* The person with the computer lives somewhere to the left of the person with the phone.

Hmm, this is a lot to keep track of!  

Okay, I see that the person who likes green lives in the third house and also has the radio. That's a good start.

Let me see... the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other, and the percussionist is next to the person who likes white.  

Oh! And the violinist is two houses away from the percussionist.

I think I'm starting to get it...

After a lot of scribbling and thinking, I figured out that the saxophonist lives in house number **1**.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down. We have two houses and two people, and we need to figure out who owns the horses.

Here's what we know:

* **People:** One person likes tea, the other likes root beer. One plays the cello, the other plays guitar. One has horses, the other has a cat. One reads mysteries, the other reads history.

* **Clues:**
    * The cellist lives to the left of the mystery reader.
    * The history buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
    * The root beer lover and the guitarist live right next to each other.

Hmm, this is tricky! Let me see...  

Since the cellist is to the left of the mystery reader, and the history buff is to the left of the cat lover, we can kind of line them up.  But the root beer lover and guitarist being next to each other makes it tricky.

Ugh, I can't figure out for sure which house the horse owner is in. It could be either one! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know there are three houses and each person has a different pet and flowers.  

Here's what the clues tell us:

* The carnations are to the right of the bird.
* The dog isn't in the middle house.
* The tulips are to the right of the dog.

Thinking it through, if the dog isn't in the middle house, they must be in the first house. That means the tulips have to be in either the second or third house. Since the carnations are to the right of the bird, the bird can't be in the last house. So, the bird must be in the first house with the dog, and the tulips must be in the second house.


So the answer is **(B) 2**. 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people living in them.  We need to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.

I'm going to try making a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House 1* | *House 2* | *House 3* | *House 4*
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
        |          |          | 

Hmm, the clues say the swimmer is in house 4, so let's put that in:

*House 1* | *House 2* | *House 3* | *House 4*
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
        |          |          | Swimmer

Now we gotta use the other clues and see if we can figure out the rest. This is gonna take some thinking!

... *After some time spent working through the clues*...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person wearing loafers lives in **House 2**. So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the person in house number 1 eats mangos.  The horse person can't be in house 1 or 2, and the banana person is to the left of the dog person. That means the banana person must be in house 2 and the dog person in house 3.

The bird person and the kiwi person live next to each other, and the horses have to be in house 4.  

So, the bird person must live in house 3!

The answer is (D) 3. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the mystery reader lives in the first house.  The romance lover can't be in the third house, and neither can the horse person.  

The bird person has to be right next to the history buff.  So, the bird person must be in the second house and the history buff in the third.

That means the romance lover has to be in the second house! 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the coffee drinker lives in the second house. That's a good starting point!

The person eating apples is right next to the water drinker.  And the mango eater can't be in the first or third house.  

Thinking it through, the apple eater has to be in the first house, the water drinker in the second, and the mango eater in the fourth. That leaves the third house for the tea drinker.

So the answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see... the person eating the banana lives in house number 3.  That's stated directly in clue number 12. 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have three houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle, we gotta figure out who lives where based on what they like and what they're wearing.

* We know the soccer player is in the middle house, house number 2.

*  The clues about the stew, high heels, and the golfer being to the right of the roses help us figure out the order of some things.

* And the clue about the daffodils and the golfer being separated by one house is important too.

If we think it through carefully, we can figure out that the person with the carnations lives in **house 1**.


So the answer is **(A)**. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a puzzle!

We have three houses and three people, each with different stuff.  We need to figure out where the percussionist lives.

Here's what I'm thinking:

* The clues tell us the minivan is to the right of the truck, and the flutist is to the left of the minivan. That means the order has to be truck, then something, then minivan.
* We also know the phone is to the left of the minivan.

Putting those together, it seems like the truck is in the first house, the phone is in the second, and the minivan is in the third.

* The cellist is right next to the minivan, so the cellist must be in the third house too.

Now, the percussionist has to be to the left of the boots.  That means the percussionist can't be in the third house.

So, the percussionist must live in the **first house**.

**Answer: (C) 1** 



"
"Okay, so we've got this puzzle about five houses and people with different stuff.  

Let's see... the person with daffodils is in house number 2, and the person eating apples is in house number 4. That's a good start!

I'm gonna try to figure out the rest by looking for clues that connect things.  Like, the person with the daffodils is to the left of the person with the TV, and the TV is to the left of the lilies.

Hmm, this is tricky! I'm gonna need to think about this some more...

...

Okay, I think I got it! The person eating apples is in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know the lily person is in house number 2.  The clues say the coffee person is right next to the rose person, and the SUV person is also right next to the coffee person.  Since the lily person is in the middle, that means the coffee person has to be in house number 3!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a little puzzle!

We have three houses and three people, and we need to figure out who lives where based on what they drive, eat, like, and what flowers they have.

Here's what I think:

* We know the minivan is to the left of the stew, and the minivan is also to the left of the daffodils. That means the minivan must be in the first house, the stew in the second, and the daffodils in the third.

* The rose bouquet is right next to the truck, so the rose must be in the first house and the truck in the second.

* The person who likes blue lives right next to the person who ate spaghetti. Since the minivan is in the first house, the blue person must be there too, and the spaghetti eater in the second house.

* We also know the stew is to the left of the lilies, so the lilies must be in the third house.

* Finally, the person who likes red can't be in the first house. Since the first two houses are taken, red must be in the third house.

So, putting it all together, the truck is in the second house!

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle where we have to figure out who lives where based on what they like and what they own.

I'd probably start by making a little chart to keep track of everything. Like, one column for each house and then rows for cars, colors, food, sports, and instruments.

Then I'd go through each clue carefully and see if I can fill anything in. Some clues are easier than others. For example, we know the soccer player is in house number 2, and the basketball player is in house number 4.

It's going to take some time and careful thinking, but I bet we can crack this!

Oh, and the question is asking for the house number where the sedan owner lives, right?  I'll let you know when I figure it out! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The person with the gameboy is in house number 3.
* The person who likes red is in house number 2.
* The person eating grapes is to the right of the person who likes red, so they must be in house number 3.

Since the person who likes white is to the left of the person eating grapes, they must be in house number 1.

Now, the person with the phone is right next to the person with the running shoes.  Since house 3 is already taken, the phone must be in house 1 and the running shoes in house 2.

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's see... the bird keeper lives in the second house. That's a pretty straightforward clue!

So the answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The saxophonist lives in the first house.
* The person who eats grapes lives next to both the tea drinker and the baseball player.

That means the first house probably has the saxophonist, the tea drinker, and the grape eater.  The second house would then have the baseball player.

We also know the golfer lives next to the saxophonist, so the golfer is in the first house too. And the romance book lover is next to the golfer, so they're in the first house as well.

That leaves the mango eater and the science fiction fan for the second house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle looks tricky!  Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.

I'm going to try drawing it out, like a little chart.  Maybe if I write down what we know, I can figure out the rest.

* House 1 has running shoes, that's a start!
* And someone's eating apples in house number 4.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues about who's next to who. I'll have to be careful and see if I can connect the dots.

*  Oh! Oranges are to the right of green, and green is to the left of blue.

This is going to take some time, but I bet I can crack it!

...

*Okay, after a lot of scribbling, I think I got it!*

The romance book lover lives in **house number 3 (A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we need to figure out which house the person wearing boots lives in.  

Let's look at the clues:

* Clue 3 says the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

So the answer is **(A) 1**.

"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... we need to figure out where the tea drinker lives.  

It seems like we have to look for clues that connect the tea drinker to a specific house number.  There are a lot of clues about who lives next to whom, and what they eat, wear, and drink.

I'm going to try making a chart to keep track of everything.  

*House Number* | *Lunch* | *Shoes* | *Sport* | *Drink*
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
1        |          |          |          |          
2        |          |          |          |          
3        |          |          |          |          
4        |          |          |          |          
5        |          |          |          |          

Okay, now I need to start filling it in with the clues. This is going to take some time! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we need to figure out where the person who likes green lives.  

It's like a big puzzle with all these clues. We gotta think about who lives where, what they drink, what flowers they have, what they ate, and their favorite color.

I'm gonna try to keep track of everything in my head, but it might take a bit.  

*Hmm, let me see...*

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It looks like we need to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.  

Hmm, there are a lot of clues about cars, flowers, sports, and pets too.  I bet if we can figure out where some of those things are, it will help us find the fried rice eater.

I'm going to try making a little chart to keep track of everything.

*House 1: Tulips, Spaghetti*

Okay, that's a start! Now I need to see if I can use the other clues to fill in more of the chart. This is going to take some thinking! 


Let me know if you want to try figuring it out together, or if you want me to keep going!
"
"Okay, let's see... we've got two houses and two people.  They like different things, and we have some clues to figure out who likes what and where they live.

The clues tell us about who eats what, what they like to read, what kind of car they drive, and what shoes they wear.  

* We know the grape eater lives next to the truck driver, and the yellow lover lives next to the truck driver too. So it's gotta be Yellow - Grapes - Truck, in that order.

* We also know the boots wearer lives next to the mystery reader.

Hmm, that means there are two ways it could be:

* Yellow - Grapes - Truck - Boots - Mystery
* Boots - Mystery - Yellow - Grapes - Truck

We don't know enough to say for sure which one is right.  

So, we can't figure out which house the fantasy book lover lives in. 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle where we have to figure out who likes what, drives what, and ate what based on where they live.

I'd probably start by drawing five boxes and labeling them 1 through 5 for the houses. Then I'd make a list of all the clues and try to see if any of them tell me something definite about a specific house.

For example, clue number 9 says the person who likes green lives in the third house. That's a good starting point!

Then I'd look for clues that connect things, like clue 7 which says the minivan is left of the mystery reader.

It's going to take some time and careful thinking, but I bet we can crack this!

Oh, and the question is asking for the house number where the fried rice eater lives.  I'll keep that in mind as I work through the clues. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We know the person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. And the golfer lives in the fourth house.  The clue about pizza being right before basketball is helpful too.

Hmm, let me think...

I'm going to go with **(C) 2** as the house where the pizza eater lives. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things:

* There's a cellist, violinist, and percussionist, each living in a different house.
* There's a soccer player, basketball player, and cricketer, each living in a different house.

Here are the clues:

1. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

Hmm, this is interesting. Since the basketball player and violinist are both in the second house, they must be the same person!

That means the cricketer can't be in the third house because the cellist has to be to their right.  

So, the only way this works is if the cricketer is in the first house, the violinist/basketball player is in the second, and the cellist is in the third.

That means the soccer player must be in the first house with the cricketer.


**Answer: (A)** 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  It's like a puzzle!

We have four houses and need to figure out who lives where based on their favorite things.

Here's what I think:

* The mystery reader is in the last house, and they drink water.
* The history buff is right next to the person with lilies.
* The green lover is right next to the coffee drinker.

Hmm, this is tricky.  Let me see...

* The tea drinker has to be somewhere before the carnations, and the red lover is before the tea drinker.

I think the tea drinker must live in house number 2! 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have four houses and a bunch of clues about the people who live there.  

It's like a puzzle, we gotta figure out who lives where based on what they like and do.

Hmm, looking at the clues, I think the best way to solve this is to start with the most obvious ones.

* We know the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, and they also play the flute and own horses!
* The tennis player can't be in the fourth house.

Let me see... there are a lot of clues about who lives next to who.  I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*  The dog owner and the root beer lover are neighbors.
* The fish enthusiast lives to the right of the basketball player.
* The water drinker and the tennis player are neighbors.

This is tough! I'm gonna need to think about this some more.  

...

Okay, I think I got it! After going through all the clues carefully, I figured out that the **fish enthusiast lives in house number (C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we know the pianist lives in house number 2.  And we also know the person with the daffodils lives right next to the pianist.  That means the daffodils must be in house number 1!

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta figure out where the sedan is.

Hmm, let me think...

* The person with oranges is in the first house.
* Bananas are in the fourth house, and that's also where the SUV is.

Okay, that's a good start.

* Daffodils are to the left of the minivan, and apples are to the left of daffodils.
* Tulips are to the left of the convertible.

Let's see... the sedan is to the right of the carnations.

Oh, and there's one house between the carnations and the lilies.

* Grapes aren't in the last house.

This is tough! I'm gonna need to draw this out to keep track of everything.

...

*Looks intensely at imaginary grid for a few moments*

...

Got it! The sedan is in house number **3**. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the soccer player is in house number 2.  And the person who likes blue lives right next to the root beer lover.  Since the soccer player is in house 2, the blue lover must be in house 1, and the root beer lover is in house 2.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see... we have five houses and five people, each with a sport, a favorite flower, and a favorite color.  

We need to figure out where the swimmer lives. There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

Hmm, let me see... the daffodils are in the second house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the first house because they're right next to the daffodils.  

Oh! The lilies have to be to the right of the swimmer, and red is right next to the lilies.  

Wait a minute... the soccer player can't be in the first or fourth house. And the cricketer is to the right of the soccer player.

This is tough! I'm gonna need to draw a little chart to keep track of everything.

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The swimmer lives in house **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down. We know the violinist lives in the first house.  The clue about the computer and the bird keeper tells us the computer person is somewhere to the left of the bird keeper. Since the violinist is already in the first house, the computer person must also be in the first house. That means the bird keeper has to be in the second house.

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we need to be organized.

I'd start by writing down all the houses and then making a list of all the things each person has (flowers, shoes, what they ate, etc.). Then I'd go through each clue and see if I can figure out where things go.

It's like a puzzle, right? We need to find the pieces that fit together.

Hmm, looking at the clues... I think the computer is in **house 3**. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know a few things for sure:

* The person in the middle house wears boots.
* The person on the far right has a sedan.
* The person in the first house loves cats.

Now, the clues tell us:

* The high heels are right next to the dog person. Since the middle house has boots, the high heels must be in the first house and the dog person in the middle house.
* The SUV is to the left of the boots, so it must be in the first house.

That means the first house has the cat lover, the SUV, and the high heels. The middle house has the dog person and the boots.  

Since the sedan is in the last house, the running shoes must be there too!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down!

It's like a puzzle, right? We gotta figure out who's doing what and where they live.

* We know the tea drinker is in the third house.
* The person with carnations is in the first house, and tulips are in the second.
* The person wearing running shoes is also in the first house.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me see...

* Oh! The person with kiwis is right next to the person who likes blue.
* And the milk drinker and the apple eater are neighbors.

Okay, I think I'm starting to get it...

*  The boots wearer is next to the green lover.

Let me think a bit more...

...

Alright, I got it! The person eating apples lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the mystery reader is in the first house because it says so right there. And they're right next to the history buff. So the history buff must be in the second house.

The mystery reader is also next to whoever has the TV, so the TV is in the second house too.

That means the computer and phone people have to be in the third house.  

Since the computer is to the right of the phone, the science fiction fan must be in the third house!

So the answer is (B).

"

So the answer is (A). 



"

Rick and Morty is a pretty wild show, and Rick is always drinking.  If you grew up with someone who had a drinking problem, seeing that kind of stuff on TV might be hard to watch. It could bring up some tough memories or feelings.

"
"I'd say no.  The Paleo diet is all about eating like cavemen did, and I don't think they had cookies back then!

So the answer is (B) No. 

"
"Yeah, sadly that's true.  People have been killing rhinos for their horns because of some crazy belief that they can, like, make you better in bed. It's totally bogus, but it's led to a lot of rhinos being poached.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"I think the answer is (A) No.  NFL players are football players, not soldiers. 🏈  They train for the game, not for the army.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out!  It looks like there's a lot of partner swapping going on.  

If we follow each switch carefully, we can keep track:

* Then he switches with Eve again, so he's with Jamie.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out step-by-step.  It's like a puzzle!

* **Start:** We know who everyone is dancing with at the beginning.

* **Switches:** They switch partners a bunch of times. It's important to keep track of who's with who after each switch.

* He also doesn't end up with Jamie or Patrick because those two switch partners with Alice and Eve.

That leaves only one option: **(A) Ophelia**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

It looks like a lot of swapping is going on!  If we follow each swap carefully, we can see where Eve ends up.
