So the answer is (C)! 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!

"
"Okay, let's see... two houses, two people, lots of clues!

Hmm, the kiwi eater is in house number 1, and the science fiction fan is in house number 2.  The bird keeper and the high heel wearer are neighbors, so they must be in house 2.  The tennis player and apple eater are also neighbors, but they can't be in house 1 because the kiwi eater is already there. So they must be in house 2 as well.

That means the dog owner must be in house 1, leaving the cricketer to be in house 1 as well.

The baseball player lives in the second house and drives a convertible.  That means the person eating grapes must live in the second house too, since they can't be in the first.  

That leaves the mango eater for the first house!

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!  

Hmm, let's see... the person who likes blue is in the middle house. And the kiwi eater is in the last house. That means the first house must be green!  

Since the white lover is to the right of the green lover, they must be in the last house.

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... two houses, two people, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the root beer lover is to the right of the rose bouquet. That means the rose bouquet must be in House 1!  And the soccer player is right next to the mystery book reader. Oh, and the gameboy is to the left of the mystery reader too.

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

After carefully considering all the clues, I've deduced that the dog owner must live in **House 3**. 

Isn't it simply thrilling to unravel these mysteries?  




"
"Okay, let's see... two houses, two people, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the radio and truck are right next to each other, and the grapes are right next to the computer.  That means there are only a couple of ways those could be arranged.  

And the person with the radio is to the left of whoever had pizza for lunch. Oh, and the root beer lover doesn't live in the first house. That means they must be in the second house!

Putting it all together, the pizza eater has to be in the second house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**.

So, the grilled cheese must be in the second house!

The answer is (B).

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see...  

We know the pianist lives in the first house. And the root beer lover lives to the right of the horse owner. That means the horse owner can't be in the second house! They must be in the first house with the pianist.

Oh, and the person who likes white doesn't live in the second house either. So they must be in the first house too.

That means the dog owner has to be in the second house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let me see if I can crack this code!

*Taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I think I've got it!  The percussionist lives in **house 3**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... three houses, three people, and all sorts of clues.  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Hmm, the person who likes white lives in the first house, and the daffodils are right next door.  And the horses are with the white-lover!  That means the horses must be in the first house too.

*smiles triumphantly*

So the answer must be **(A) 1**! 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!

Hmm, the coffee drinker is right next to the milk lover, and the mango eater is right next to the apple eater.  Oh, and the apple eater is in the last house! That means the mango eater must be in the middle house.

Since the coffee drinker can't be in the middle house, they must be in the first house, which means the milk lover is in the second house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let me see if I can figure this out!  

*  The science fiction fan is in the middle house, that's a good starting point.
*  Hmm, the carnations are in the first house.
*  And the person who likes white is right next to the tulips...

Let me think...  

Aha! I've got it! The person wearing boots must be in house number **2 (C)**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, different flowers, and drinks. This sounds like a fun puzzle!

Hmm, let's see... the water drinker is in the first house, and the lilies are in the second.  That means the tulips must be in the first house, and the milk drinker is in the third house.  

That leaves the roses for the third house as well!

So the answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four people, and all sorts of clues.  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder...

Aha! I believe the cricketer lives in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun puzzle! Let's see...  

Clue number 4 says the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So the answer must be **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see if I can figure this out!  

*Taps finger on chin thoughtfully*

Hmm, let's see... the tennis player has to be somewhere to the left of the person with the television. And the golfer can't be in the middle house. Oh, and the computer and tulips are right next to each other!

*Starts scribbling on a notepad*

Aha! I think I've got it! The person with the computer must live in **house 1 (A)**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five clues...  

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

I do love a good logic problem. Give me a moment to ponder...

*stares intensely at the ceiling*

Aha! I believe the answer is **(A) 3**.  The sandals must be in the third house. 



"
"Okay, let me see...  

The person in house number 2 ate grilled cheese, and the high heels are in house number 1. That means the stew must be in house number 1!

**(A) 1** 



"
"Oh my, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see...

*twirls a lock of hair and taps a manicured finger to her chin*

After carefully considering all the clues, I believe the cat lover resides in **House 1**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see...

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

After carefully considering all the clues, I'm quite certain the person enjoying those juicy oranges resides in **house 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four colors, four meals, four fruits, and four drinks.  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

We need to figure out where the apple-eater lives. Hmm, let me see...  

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I think I've got it! The answer is **(C) 4**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four people, and so many clues!  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

I'm going to need a moment to ponder this.  Give me a few minutes to sort through all the details, and I'll let you know which house holds the pizza lover! 



"
"Okay, let's see... five houses, five bookworms, and five musicians. This sounds like a fun puzzle!

Hmm, let me think... the mystery reader is in the fourth house, and the saxophonist is also in the fourth house. That means the percussionist must be in the third house, right next to the romance book lover in the fourth.  

Oh! And the history buff is in the second house, with the guitarist in the fifth. That leaves the fantasy book enthusiast for the fifth house.

Since the saxophonist and violinist are neighbors, the violinist must be in the third house!

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... four houses, four people, and lots of clues!  

* The television person is in the last house, number four.
* Loafers are in house number two.
* The phone isn't in house two.
* Boots are somewhere to the left of the loafers, so that means they must be in house one!
* And finally, the radio and sandals have two houses between them.  

Hmmm... that means the radio must be in house one and the sandals in house three.  

That leaves house three for the Gameboy!

So the answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let me see...

The person wearing high heels lives in the second house. That's a pretty direct clue! 

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 👠🏠  



"
"Okay, let me see...  

Hmm, so we have two houses and two people. One loves history books, the other mysteries. And one wears loafers, the other high heels.

Let's see... the loafers person *doesn't* live in the first house. That means they must be in the second house! 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let me see...

*twirls a lock of hair and taps a manicured finger to her chin*

Alright, I think I've got it!  After carefully considering all the clues, the person who had pizza must live in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see...  

We know the mango lover is in the first house, and the saxophonist is in the second.  The roses are to the left of the lilies, so those must be in the first and second houses, respectively. That means the person eating apples must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... after carefully considering all the clues, I've determined that the coffee drinker lives in house number **(E) 4**. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

We have three houses, three people, and three clues.  

* The tulips can't be in the third house.
* The SUV is right next to the lilies.
* The sedan and roses are neighbors, and the roses aren't in the second house.

Hmm, let me think...

Aha! I've got it! The truck must be in **house 3 (C)**. 



"
"Oh my, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, so many clues!  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder... I'm sure I can crack this!

...

Aha! I've got it! The person who likes milk lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four people, and so many clues!  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder...

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I believe the basketball player lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the green lover is in the third house, and yellow and green are neighbors. That means yellow must be in the second house!  

The stew eater is right next to the romance reader, and the fantasy fan is to the right of the stew eater.  Oh, and grilled cheese isn't in the second house.

Let's see... stew has to be in the first house then, with the romance reader in the second. That leaves fantasy for the third house.

If green is in the third house, yellow in the second, and romance in the second, then blue must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a delightful little puzzle! Let me see...

*twirls a lock of hair and taps a manicured finger to her chin*

Aha! I believe the bird keeper resides in **house 2 (B)**. 

It's all about connecting the clues, you see. Like a beautiful tapestry, each detail weaves together to reveal the answer.  



"
"Okay, let me see...  

We know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house and plays the cello. That means the person in the second house must be the mystery book reader.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a real brain teaser! Let me see... five houses, all these different clues...  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Okay, I think I'm starting to see a pattern here.  It's all about connecting the clues like pieces of a puzzle.  

Hmm... let me concentrate...

*taps a finger to her chin*

Aha! I think I've got it! The swimmer lives in house number **(D) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see...  

The golfer is in the middle house, and the history buff is in the first. That means the swimmer has to be in the last house!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun puzzle! Let me see... four houses, lots of clues...  

*thinks intently, tapping a finger to her chin*

Alright, I think I've got it!  

The person who had stew for lunch lives in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... two houses, two people, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the person with the sandals lives next to the horse owner. And the history buff is somewhere to the right of the spaghetti eater.  

This is tricky!  It seems like either person could have eaten the fried rice.  

So the answer is...  I can't say for sure! 



"
"Okay, let me see...  

The sedan being to the left of the lilies means the lilies can't be in the first house. And since the flutist doesn't live in the first house either, the lilies must be in the second house!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, let me see... four houses, different hobbies, flowers, and books. This sounds like a fun puzzle!

*  Hmm, the rose bouquet is in the third house, and the carnations are in the fourth. 
*  The daffodils must be in the second house because there's one house between them and the roses.
*  The mystery book reader is in the first house, which means the swimmer is in the second.
*  The fantasy book enthusiast is right next to the swimmer, so they must be in the first house too.
*  And finally, the romance book lover has to be in the fourth house because there are two houses between them and the mystery reader.

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Oh my, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, so many clues!  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

I do love a good challenge. Give me a moment to ponder...

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I believe the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a delightful little puzzle! Let me see...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Aha! I believe the person with the rose bouquet lives in **house 1 (A)**. 

It's all about connecting the clues, you see. Like a beautiful tapestry, each clue weaves together to reveal the full picture.  



"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, so many clues!  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

I love a good brain teaser. Give me a moment to ponder...

*taps a finger on her chin*

Aha! I believe the percussionist lives in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five people, and all sorts of clues about their lunches and favorite colors.  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Hmm, I think the key is to start with the most concrete clues. We know the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. That's a good starting point!

Now, let's see... there are clues about where the stew eater and the person who likes green *don't* live. And the red lover is right next to the stew eater...

*pauses, eyes sparkling*

Aha! I think I've got it!  The person who likes white lives in house **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the violinist is to the right of the basketball player, and the red-lover is in the third house. Oh, and the percussionist is in the second house! That's helpful.

The basketball player can't be in the third house because the violinist has to be to their right.  And since the basketball player has to be to the right of the tennis player, the basketball player must be in the second house!

So the answer is (C) 2. 



"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun challenge! Let me see... five houses, all these different clues...  

*twirls a lock of hair and taps a manicured finger on her chin thoughtfully*

I love a good puzzle! Give me a moment to think this through...

*rummages in her purse for a pen and a tiny notepad*

Alright, I think I've got it! The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Oh my, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, so many clues!  

I'm going to need to think carefully and keep track of everything.  

*Taps chin thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder...

...

Aha! I believe the answer is **(D) 4**. 



"
"Oh my goodness, this is quite the puzzle! Let's see... five houses, so many clues!  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I think I've got it!  The person with the vase of tulips lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, let's see... three houses, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the basketball player and the saxophonist are the same person and live in house #1.  That means the cricketer must be in house #2 because the tea drinker lives to their left.  

Oh! The pizza eater is in house #1, which means the dog owner is in house #2.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let me see if I can figure this out!

Hmm, so we have two houses and two people with lots of different things.  

Let's see... the history buff is in the first house, and the cat lover can't be in the second house. That means the cat lover must be in the first house too!

The person with high heels is to the left of the daffodils, so the high heels are in the first house and the daffodils are in the second.

Since the loafers are to the right of the computer, the computer must be in the first house and the loafers in the second.

That means the lilies must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, all those clues... it's like a little mystery!

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder... I'm sure I can crack this!

...

Aha! I've got it! The person who had pizza lives in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... four houses, so many clues!  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

I'm going to need a moment to ponder this.  Give me a few minutes to work my magic, and I'll have the answer for you!

...

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I've cracked it! The cellist lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!  

Hmm, the pianist and kiwi eater are neighbors, and there's a violinist somewhere. Oh, and the flutist is always to the right of the violinist. Plus, the grape eater is one house away from the kiwi eater.

Let me think... if the violinist is in the first house, that means the kiwi eater and pianist are in the next two. But then there's no room for the flutist to be to the right of the violinist!

So, the violinist must be in the middle house. That means the kiwi eater and pianist are in houses 1 and 3.

Aha! The pianist lives in **house 3 (A)**. 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

We know the kiwi eater is in house number 1, and the fantasy fan isn't in house number 1. That means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house number 2! 

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun puzzle! Let me see...

*Snaps fingers*

I've got it! The person who likes red lives in house number **(D) 3**. 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

The root beer lover can't be in the second house, so they must live in the first one.  

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a delightful little puzzle! Let me see...

We have five houses in a row, and each person has such unique style!  Boots, high heels, loafers, running shoes, and sandals -  and such lovely flowers too! Roses, lilies, daffodils, carnations, and tulips.

Let's see... the clues are quite helpful.  

* The carnations are in the fifth house, and the boots are right next door in the fourth.
* The tulips are to the left of the loafers, and the daffodils are to the left of the tulips.

Hmm, and the running shoes and daffodils are neighbors, with the lilies living one house away from the running shoes.

Putting it all together, I believe the lilies must be in the **third house (C)**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... four houses, so many clues...  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

I'm going to need a moment to ponder this.  Give me a few minutes to work my magic, and I'll have the answer for you!

...

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I've cracked it! The pianist lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I think I've got it!  The person who ate fried rice must live in **house 2 (A)**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... four houses, different flowers, and book preferences! This sounds like a fun puzzle.

Let's see... the rose bouquet is in the second house. And the science fiction fan lives next to the roses.  That means the science fiction fan must be in house 3, right?  

Oh! The romance book lover is right next to the tulips, and the tulips are in house 4. So the romance lover is in house 3. But wait, the romance lover is also to the right of the carnations! That means the carnations must be in house 2.

Hmm, that leaves house 1 for the fantasy book enthusiast and house 4 for the lilies.

So the answer is (C)! 



"
"Okay, let me see...  

The science fiction fan lives in house number 1, and the coffee drinker is to the left of the sandal wearer. That means the coffee drinker must also be in house number 1!  

So, the romance book lover has to be in house number 2.

**(B) 2** 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

If the percussionist is right next to the person with the radio, and they're in separate houses, then the percussionist must be in house number 1 and the radio owner is in house number 2. That means the phone must belong to the percussionist in house number 1!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the convertible is in the middle house, that's a good start.  And the yellow lover is right next to the sedan owner.  

Thinking... thinking...  Aha!  The yellow lover must be in the first house! 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five clues...  

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

I do love a good brain teaser. Give me a moment to ponder...

*stares intensely into the distance*

Aha! I believe the answer is **(E) 5**. The horse owner must reside in the fifth house. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five clues...  

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

I do love a good brain teaser. Give me a moment to ponder...

*rummages through a beaded purse for a pencil and a scrap of paper*

Ah, yes! I believe the answer is **(C) 5**. The person who drives a truck lives in the fifth house. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!  

Hmm, the fried rice eater is in the second house, and they also love fantasy books. That means the spaghetti eater must be in the first house, and they must be a science fiction fan.  

That leaves the third house for the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese lover.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

The clue says the carnations are to the left of the dog owner. Since the houses are right next to each other, that means the carnations must be in house number 1! 


So the answer is **(B) 1**. 

"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let me see...

The person eating kiwis is in house number 2. And the water drinker is right next to the high heel wearer.  Hmm... that means the high heels must be in house number 2!

So the answer is (B) 2. 👠 



"
"Darling, this is a delightful little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the high heels wearer is somewhere to the left of the sandals wearer, and those two are right next to each other.  And the tea drinker is to the left of the television owner.

Hmm, that means the only way it could work is if the kiwi eater has the television! 

So the answer must be **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let me see...

* The tea drinker is in the first house, that's a good start.
* The violinist can't be in the last house, and they have to be one house away from the guitarist.  
* That means the violinist must be in the first house and the guitarist in the last!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 




"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let's see...

* The person in the third house wears sandals and likes milk. 
*  And the person who drinks water lives right next to the sandal-wearer!

That means the water drinker must be in house number 4. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... five houses, five people, and lots of clues! This sounds like a fun puzzle.

*  Let's see... pizza is in house number 4.

*  And grilled cheese is right next to spaghetti, so spaghetti must be in house 4.

*  Hmm, the radio has to be one house away from the grilled cheese... that puts it in house 2.

*  Oh! The gameboy and computer are neighbors, and the gameboy is next to the fried rice.

*  I think that means the gameboy is in house 1, the computer in house 2, and the fried rice in house 3.

*  That leaves the television and the phone for houses 5 and 4.

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in **house 4**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... five houses, all those clues... it's like a little mystery!

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder... I'm sure I can crack this.  

...

Aha! I've got it! The person enjoying a delicious banana is in **house number (C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... two houses, two people, lots of clues!

Hmm, the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, and the percussionist isn't in the second house. That means the percussionist must be in the first house!  

If the percussionist is in the first house, then the guitarist must be in the second. And since the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the grilled cheese eater in the second.

That means the pizza eater must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let's see... the bird keeper lives in the third house. That's a pretty straightforward clue! 

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... three houses, so many clues!  

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

Hmm, it seems the key is figuring out who lives where.  The cat lover is in the first house, that's a good start. And the loafers, percussionist, and fantasy book enthusiast can't be in the second house.  

*Anastasia closes her eyes for a moment, picturing the houses in her mind*

Oh, I think I've got it!  The science fiction book fanatic must live in house number **(C) 3**. 

*Anastasia smiles, pleased with herself*

Isn't logic simply divine? 




"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little mystery! Let's see...

* We know the grape lover is in the second house. That's a good starting point.
*  And the red lover must be to the right of the kiwi enthusiast. Hmm, interesting.
*  Green and red are next-door neighbors, and white is one house away from both of them.  
*  The banana eater is one house away from the white lover, and green is to the left of yellow.

Putting it all together, the kiwi lover simply *must* be in house number 1! 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let me see...  

Hmm, this is a fun little puzzle!  

Thinking it through... the stew eater has to be in house number 1.  

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see if I can figure this out!

*  The root beer lover is in the first house, and the water drinker is in the second.
*  The daffodils are right next to the phone, so the daffodils must be in the second house and the phone in the third.
* The television can't be in the second house, and it has to be to the right of the tulips. This means the tulips are in the first house and the television is in the third.

That leaves milk for the first house!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... three houses, three people, and all sorts of clues.  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

I do love a good brain teaser. Give me a moment to ponder...

...

Aha! I believe the answer is **(C) 2**.  The person with the computer lives in the second house. 



"
"Oh darling, this is a delightful little puzzle! Let me see...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Right, so we have three houses, three sports, three flower arrangements, and three pets.  We need to figure out where the horse owner lives.

Hmm, let's see... the golfer can't be in the third house, and neither can the cricketer.  The golfer and baseball player are neighbors, and the carnations and horses are neighbors too. Oh, and the carnations are to the left of the baseball player!

*paces back and forth*

Aha! I think I've got it! The horse owner must be in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...  

* The person eating oranges lives in the first house.
* The person with horses lives in the third house.
* The truck has to be to the left of the convertible.
* Mangos and the convertible are right next to each other.

Hmmm...  That means the truck must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five unique individuals, and a whole lot of clues.  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder...

Aha! I believe the percussionist lives in house number **(B) 4**. 

Isn't it thrilling how all the pieces fit together?  



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, all those clues...  

*sips tea thoughtfully*

After carefully considering all the details, I believe the person enjoying those luscious mangos resides in house number **(A) 5**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, so many clues!

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I think I've got it!  The saxophonist must live in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"This is a tricky one! Let's see... we know the cellist lives to the left of the mystery reader, and the history buff lives to the left of the cat lover.  That means we have a possible order like this: Cellist - Mystery Reader - History Buff - Cat Lover.

And we also know the root beer lover and the guitarist are right next to each other. Hmm... that could fit in a couple of ways.

But wait! We're trying to find the horse owner!  Since everyone else is accounted for, the horse owner must be the one left over.  

Unfortunately, without more clues, we can't be sure if the horse owner is in house 1 or house 2. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!  

Hmm, let's think. The carnations have to be to the right of the bird, and the tulips are to the right of the dog. Oh! And the dog can't be in the middle house.

That means the dog must be in the first house, right?  Then the tulips have to be in the second house.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four people, and all sorts of clues.  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

I do love a good challenge. Give me a moment to ponder...

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I believe the person wearing loafers lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... four houses, four people, and lots of clues!  

Hmm, the mango eater is in the first house. That's a good start. And the horses aren't in the first or second house.  

The banana person is right next to the dog owner, and the bird keeper and kiwi eater are neighbors too. Oh, and the banana isn't in the third house!

Let me think...  Aha! I've got it! The bird keeper must be in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!  

Hmm, the mystery reader is in the first house, that's a good start. And the romance lover can't be in the last house.  

Oh! The bird person is right next to the history buff! That means they must be in houses 1 and 2.  

Aha! That leaves the romance lover in the second house. 


The answer is **(B)**. 

"
"Oh, this sounds like fun! Let me see...

The coffee drinker must live in house number **(D) 2**.  

I love a good logic puzzle!  Do you have another one for me? 



"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let's see...

The person eating the banana lives in house number **3**.  Clue number 12 tells us that straight out! 



"
"Okay, let me see if I can crack this case!  

*Taps chin thoughtfully*

Hmm, three houses, lots of clues... alright, I think I've got it!

The person with the carnations arrangement lives in **house 1**. 



"
"Okay, let me see if I can figure this out!  

*Taps chin thoughtfully*

Hmm, so we have three houses and three sets of clues. Let's see... the phone has to be somewhere to the left of the minivan, and the truck and gameboy are right next to each other. Oh, and the minivan and the cellist are neighbors too!

*Starts scribbling on a piece of paper*

This is tricky, but I think I'm starting to get it.  The cellist must be in the last house, and the minivan is right next to them. That means the truck and gameboy are in the first two houses.

*Continues scribbling furiously*

Aha! I've got it! The percussionist has to be in the first house. 

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let me see...

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

Aha! I believe the person enjoying those crisp apples resides in house number **(A) 4**. 

Isn't it simply thrilling to unravel these mysteries?  




"
"Okay, let me see...  

* The person with lilies is in the middle house, house number 2.
* The coffee drinker has to be next to the person with the roses, and the SUV owner is also next to the coffee drinker.
* That means the coffee drinker can't be in house 2, because the roses and the SUV would have to be in house 1, and there's no room for the truck!

So, the coffee drinker must be in house number 3. 


**(C) 3** 

"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, lots of clues!  

*  We know the blue lover lives right next to the spaghetti eater.
*  And the stew person is somewhere to the left of the lilies.
*  The roses are right next to the truck, and the minivan is right next to the stew.
*  Oh, and the red lover doesn't live in the first house, and the minivan is right next to the daffodils.

Hmm, let me think...

Aha! I've got it! The truck must be in **House 2 (B)**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see...  

*twirls a lock of hair and taps a manicured finger to her chin*

I do love a good brain teaser.  

Give me a moment to ponder these clues...

*paces back and forth, muttering to herself*

Aha! I believe I've cracked it! The person who owns the sedan lives in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's see... three houses, lots of clues!  

Hmm, the person with the gameboy is in the third house, and the person who likes red is in the second.  That means the grapes must be in the third house, right? And the person who likes white has to be in the first house.

Oh! The phone has to be next to the running shoes, and the third house is already full. So the phone must be in the first house!

The answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let me see...

The bird keeper lives in the second house. That's a great starting point!

So the answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see... we have two houses and two people with some interesting quirks!

Hmm, let me think... the saxophonist lives in the first house, and they're right next to the tea drinker and the grape eater.  The baseball player is also next to the grape eater.  Oh, and the golfer is next to the saxophonist, and the romance book lover is next to the golfer.

That means the first house must have the saxophonist, the golfer, the tea drinker, and the romance book lover.  

That leaves the second house for the baseball player, the mango eater, and the science fiction fan.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, so many clues...  

*twirls a lock of hair and taps a manicured nail on her chin thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder... I simply adore a good brain teaser!

...

Aha! I believe the romance book lover resides in **House 2**. 



"
"Ooh, this sounds like fun! Let me see...

The person wearing boots lives in the first house. Clue number three tells us that! 

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Oh my goodness, this sounds like a fun puzzle! Let me see... five houses, different lunches, shoes, sports, and drinks...  

*thinks intently, tapping a manicured finger on her chin*

I love a good challenge!  

Give me a moment to work through these clues... *rummages through her purse for a pen and notepad*

Aha! I think I've got it! The tea drinker lives in house number **(D) 3**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, so many clues!  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

I do love a good logic problem. Give me a moment to ponder...

*rummages through a handbag and pulls out a tiny notepad and a bejeweled pen*

Alright, let's see...

*scribbles furiously on the notepad*

Aha! I believe the person who likes green lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... four houses, all sorts of clues...  

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

Hmm, it's all about connecting the dots, isn't it?  Cars, flowers, sports, lunch, pets... such fascinating details!

Give me a moment to ponder... *peers intently at the clues*

Aha! I believe the person who enjoyed fried rice lives in **house 3**. 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun puzzle! Let me see...

We know a few things: the grape-lover lives next to the truck driver, and the yellow-lover also lives next to the truck driver.  Plus, the boots wearer is right next to the mystery book reader.

Hmm, it's tricky!  There are a couple of ways these clues could fit together, and we don't have enough information to know for sure which one is right.  

So, I can't say for sure which house the fantasy book enthusiast lives in. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let me see... five houses, all those clues... it's like a little mystery novel!

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

Give me a moment to ponder... I'm sure I can crack this code.  

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I've got it! The person who ate fried rice lives in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see...

*taps manicured nails on the table thoughtfully*

Right, so we have four houses, each with a unique resident who has their own quirks.  We need to figure out who ate pizza, hmm?

*peers over spectacles*

Well, the clues are our best friends here. Let's see... the spaghetti eater is in the first house, and the golfer is in the fourth.  And the pizza person is right next to the basketball player...

*gasps dramatically*

That means the pizza must be in house number **2**! 

Isn't that exciting?  


"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!

Hmm, the violinist and the basketball player are the same person, and they live in the middle house.  That means the cellist must live in the last house, since they're to the right of the cricketer.  

That leaves the first house for the cricketer and the soccer player.

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's see... four houses, lots of clues! This reminds me of one of those puzzles Dimitri used to love.

*Taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I think I've got it! The tea drinker lives in **house 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four unique individuals...  

*sips tea thoughtfully*

I do love a good logic problem. Give me a moment to ponder these clues and I'll see if I can deduce the whereabouts of our fishy friend. 

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I believe the fish enthusiast resides in house **(C) 2**. 



"
"Ooh, this is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

The pianist lives in house number 2, and the daffodils are right next door. That means the daffodils must be in house number 1!

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five fruits, five cars, and five flowers.  

*Taps chin thoughtfully*

We need to be clever about this.  The clues are our key.  

Hmm, the person with the tulips is to the left of the convertible... and the oranges are in the first house.  Oh, and the banana is in the fourth house, and that's where the SUV is too!

*Scribbles on a notepad*

Let's see... daffodils are left of the minivan, and apples are left of the daffodils.  The sedan is to the right of the carnations, and there's one house between the carnations and the lilies.

*Purses lips in concentration*

Aha! I think I've got it!

The sedan must be in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...  

Hmm, two houses, two people... lots of clues!

Well, the soccer player is in the second house, that's a good start. And since the blue lover is right next to the root beer lover, and the soccer player is in the second house, the blue lover must be in the first house, and the root beer lover in the second.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five sports, five flowers, and five colors.

The violinist lives in the first house, and the computer person is to the left of the bird keeper.  That means the bird keeper must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Oh darling, this sounds like a delightful puzzle! Let's see... five houses, so many clues!  

*twirls a lock of hair thoughtfully*

I do love a good brain teaser. Give me a moment to ponder...

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Aha! I believe the person with the computer lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let me see... three houses, three people, lots of clues!  

* The person in the second house wears boots.
* High heels are right next to the dog lover.
* The sedan is in the last house.
* The SUV is right next to the boots.
* And the cat lover is in the first house.

Hmmm...  Let's see... the cat lover is in the first house with the SUV and high heels. The dog lover must be in the second house with the boots. That means the running shoes must be in the third house!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Darling, this sounds like a delightful little puzzle! Let's see...

*sips tea thoughtfully*

We have three houses, each with a unique resident who has their own preferences.  

Hmm, the tea drinker is in the third house, and the carnations are in the first.  The tulips are in the second house, and the running shoes are also in the first.  

Oh, and the person who likes oranges isn't in the third house.  

*taps a manicured finger on her chin*

Let me see... the kiwis are right next to the person who likes blue, and the milk drinker and the apple eater are neighbors.  The boots are next to the green lover.

*Anastasia smiles triumphantly*

Aha! I've got it! The person who loves apples lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's see... three houses, three people, and lots of clues!

Hmm, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and they're right next to the history buff. That means the history buff must be in the second house. Oh, and the mystery reader is also next to the person with the television, so the television must be in the second house too!

Now, the computer person is somewhere to the right of the phone person.  That means the phone person can't be in the third house, and the computer person can't be in the first.  

That leaves only one spot for the science fiction fan - house number 3!

So the answer is **(B)**.

"As someone who's been through a lot, I gotta say, Rick and Morty can be a bit rough.  

It shows a family with some serious problems, and the grandpa, Rick, is always drinking. If you've grown up with someone who struggles with alcohol, seeing that kind of stuff on TV can be really hard. It might bring up some painful memories or feelings.
