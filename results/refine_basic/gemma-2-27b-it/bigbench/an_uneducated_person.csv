"Okay, lemme see...

So there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different flower and a different music thingy.

The flutist is in the second house, that's easy. And the tulips gotta be next to the guitar player.  

Hmm... the lilies are next to the carnations, and the piano player is one house away from the flutist...

I think the tulips gotta be in the first house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff.  

One guy's eatin' kiwis, one's eatin' grapes, and one's eatin' oranges. They all like different drinks too - coffee, root beer, and water. And they each got a favorite color - blue, white, or green. Oh, and they play different music things - guitar, cello, and somethin' called percussion. And they each got a gadget - TV, phone, or a game thing.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of!

Let's see... the root beer fella lives somewhere before the grape guy. And the TV guy lives before the root beer guy. And the water guy lives before the root beer guy too.

The green guy lives in the first house, and he's eatin' kiwis.

The blue guy and the game fella live right next to each other. And the drummer guy doesn't live in the middle house.

Hmmm...  I think the cello player lives in the **third** house. 


(C)
"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person doin' different stuff.  They're eatin' different fruits, drinkin' different things, wearin' different shoes, playin' different sports, and they all like different colors.

There's a bunch of clues, but lemme see...

* The kiwi guy lives in the last house.
* The red lover is in the second house.
* The tennis player is also in the last house.

Hmm, that's a start.  

*The person who likes green lives in house number (C) 3* 



"
"Okay, so lemme see... there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a person in it, doin' their own thing.  

One likes root beer, one's a tea drinker, one's all about coffee, and one just drinks water.  They're all eatin' different stuff too - apples, oranges, mangos, and grapes. And for lunch, it's like a buffet - grilled cheese, spaghetti, fried rice, and pizza.

Oh, and they got different shoes - high heels, runnin' shoes, loafers, and sandals. And cars! SUV, truck, minivan, and a fancy convertible.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.

Let me see... the truck guy lives next to the SUV guy, and the loafer dude is next to the convertible guy.  The high heels lady is in the third house.

Oh, and the grape eater is somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

Man, this is hard!

...

Alright, I think I got it! The tea drinker is in house number **2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says the grilled cheese guy lives in the fifth house. So the answer is (A) 5. 



"
"Okay, lemme see... so there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella doin' different stuff. One's kickin' a ball, one's shootin' hoops, and one's swimmin'. They're also eatin' different fruits, like bananas, mangos, and oranges. And they got different flowers in their houses, tulips, lilies, and daffodils.

Now, there's some clues...

The soccer guy's gotta be somewhere before the orange eater. And the swimmer and the daffodil fella are right next to each other.  The tulip guy's gotta be after the mango eater.

Hmmm... thinkin'... thinkin'...

I bet the daffodil guy is in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it. They all like different stuff, like music and flowers and books and food.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

One guy plays the violin, and he's in the first house.  And someone has daffodils, but they gotta be in the house before the drummer guy.

Hmm... the history buff lives to the right of the tulips, and there's gotta be a radio house in between them.

Oh, and the spaghetti eater ain't in the middle house.

Gosh, this is tricky!

...

Wait a minute... I think the tulips are in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a different fella in it. They all got different stuff, like one's got a gameboy, one's got a phone, and one's got a computer. And they all like different flowers and music and stuff.

Hmm... let me think...

* The bird guy can't be in the first house, and he can't be in the last one neither. So he must be in the middle house.
* The mystery book fella is in the middle house too.
* The history book guy is right next to the lilies.
* The gameboy guy is right next to the roses.

I think... I think the gameboy guy is in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda fruit, pet, thingy they use, and flowers.  

That's a lot to keep track of!  

Let me see...  

Hmmm...  

I think the answer is (D) 4.  

Yeah, I think that's it. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one guy's got sandals, the other's got boots. One likes mysteries, the other's into history. One drives a fancy car, the other a truck.

That convertible fella's gotta be next to the history nerd, right? And the boots guy ain't in the first house.

So, if the convertible's in the first house, and the boots guy ain't there, that means the sandals guy's gotta be in the first house!

(A) 1 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's four houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person in it. One likes history books, one likes mysteries, one likes fantasy, and one likes lovey-dovey books. And they all play different sports too.

Hmm... the swimmer's next to the lovey-dovey book person, but not in the third house.  The basketball player ain't in the last house. And the mystery person is right next to the history buff. Oh, and the golfer's in the first house.

Let me think... if the swimmer's not in the third house, and they're next to the lovey-dovey book person, they gotta be in the second house, right?  And the lovey-dovey book person would be in the third.

The mystery person's gotta be next to the history buff, so they can't be in the last house either.

That means the basketball player's gotta be in the third house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says the mystery book reader is in the third house. So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a person with somethin' different. One's got a phone, one's got a computer thingy, and one's got one of them Gameboys. And they all like different colors, yellow, blue, and green.

Hmm... let me see...

The green person's gotta be next to the Gameboy person, and the Gameboy person's gotta be next to the computer person.  And the yellow person can't be in the middle house.

I think that means the computer person's gotta be in the last house, number 3.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one has a person with a favorite color, drink, and book.  

It's kinda confusing, but I think the coffee drinker is in house number 4.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One guy likes mysteries, the other likes those fantasy books. One eats pizza, one eats spaghetti. One's got a phone, one's got a radio. One likes green, one likes yellow. And one's got a cat, one's got a fish.

Hmm... let me see...

The guy who likes green is next to the radio guy. And the fantasy book guy is in the first house.  The pizza guy ain't in the first house.

So, if the fantasy guy is in the first house, and the pizza guy ain't, the pizza guy must be in the second house.

That means the green guy is in the first house, and the radio guy is in the second.

The fish guy ain't in the first house, so he must be in the second.

So, the cat guy gotta be in the first house!

**(A) 1** 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Lots of words and stuff.  

Let me see... houses, pets, books, food... drinks...  

I think the answer is (C) 3.  

That's my guess anyway!
"
"Well, shoot, that's a tough one!  Let me see...  It says right there in the clues that the kiwi eater is in the first house. So it's gotta be **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it eatin' different stuff and havin' different flowers.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but lemme see...

* The rose person is right next to the grilled cheese eater.
* Oranges gotta be before apples.
* Tulips ain't in the last house.
* Grilled cheese and stew are buddies, right next to each other.
* Daffodils ain't in the last house neither.
* Pizza's gotta be before grilled cheese.
* Grilled cheese is after spaghetti.
* Grilled cheese and tulips are right next to each other.
* Oranges and kiwis got two houses between 'em.
* Oranges are after carnations.
* Apples are before mangos.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.  

Let me think...

...

I think the stew eater is in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different critter and some flowers.

That cat person's gotta be in the first house, that's easy.

Hmm... the tulip person is right next to the dog person... and the horse person is somewhere near the carnations...

Oh! I got it! The fish person's gotta be in the last house!

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella's got boots, the other's got fancy shoes. One's got horses, the other's got a dog. One's got a phone, the other's got a radio.

The phone guy's in the first house, and the boots guy ain't in the second house. So the boots guy must be in the first house too.

That means the fancy shoes gotta be in the second house.

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it wearin' different shoes, eatin' different stuff, and likin' different colors.  

* One guy's got sandals, one's got boots, and one's got them fancy loafers.
* One likes blue, one likes green, and one likes yellow.
* One's munchin' on apples, one's got grapes, and one's eatin' mangos.
* One had grilled cheese, one had pizza, and one had that fried rice stuff.
* And one's got a computer, one's got a phone, and one's got a radio.

Now, they gave us some clues, see?

* The grilled cheese fella and the computer guy live right next to each other, and the grilled cheese guy ain't in the last house.
* The apple guy ain't in the first house.
* The grape guy lives somewhere to the right of the boots guy.
* There's one house between the blue guy and the phone guy.
* The loafers guy ain't in the last house neither.
* The pizza guy ain't in the middle house.
* The mango guy lives right next to the yellow guy.
* The loafers guy and the computer guy live right next to each other.
* The computer guy lives to the left of the phone guy.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.

Let me think...

...

Okay, I think the green guy lives in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff. One's a swimmer, one plays ball, one's got a bird, and so on.

Hmm... let me think...

* The basketball guy can't be in the first house.
* He's gotta be before the swimmer fella.
* The baseball guy's in the second house, that's easy.
* The fishy guy's gotta be after the dog guy.
* The bird guy ain't in the first house neither.
* The tennis guy's right next to the cat guy.
* And the bird guy ain't in the third house.

Gosh, this is tricky!

...

Wait a minute... I got it! The bird guy's gotta be in house number **4**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

It's kinda like a puzzle.  

One guy likes white, one likes blue, and one likes yellow. They each got a different car too - one's got a fancy convertible, one's got a big SUV, and one's got a regular sedan.

And get this, they all play different music! One's a violinist, one plays guitar, and one plays the saxophone.

Oh, and they each got a different thingamajig - a computer, a TV, or a gameboy.

And lastly, they each play a sport - baseball, swimming, or soccer.

Now, there are some clues to figure out who lives where:

1. The white-lovin' guy lives somewhere to the right of the computer guy.
2. The baseball player lives one house away from the blue-lovin' guy.
3. The sedan guy lives right next to the SUV guy.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the SUV guy.
5. The violinist doesn't live in the first house.
6. The sedan guy and the gameboy guy live right next to each other.
7. The guitar guy lives somewhere to the right of the white-lovin' guy.

Whew! That's a lot to remember.

So, where does the soccer player live?

(A) 1
(B) 3
(C) 2 

I think it's gotta be **(C) 2**.  But I could be wrong! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says right here the grilled cheese guy lives in the first house. So the answer is (E) 1. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella doin' somethin' different. One's playin' the piano, one's got a fiddle, and one's bangin' on somethin'. They're all wearin' different shoes too, one's got fancy shoes, one's got sneakers, and one's got big ol' boots. And they're eatin' different stuff, oranges, bananas, and some kinda fuzzy fruit. Oh, and they each got a gadget, a TV, a phone, or a radio.

Now, there's a bunch of clues, but it's all jumbled up.  

Let me think... the fella with the piano ain't in the first house. And the guy with the oranges is somewhere after the guy with the fuzzy fruit.  The piano man and the fancy shoes guy are right next to each other, and so are the sneakers and the banger. The fuzzy fruit guy is before the boots guy, and the radio guy is before the fancy shoes guy. And the oranges guy is right next to the TV guy.

Whew! That's a lot to remember.

Hmmm... I think the TV guy is in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person with a different car and stuff.  

It's kinda confusing, but I think the guy with the sedan lives in house number **4**.  

Hope that's right! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, the kiwi guy's in the first house, right? And the truck ain't in the last house, and neither's the SUV.  

The truck can't be in the first house neither. So, that means the truck's gotta be in the middle house, right? And if the truck's in the middle, the SUV's gotta be there too, 'cause it can't be in the other houses.

So the answer is (B) House 2. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, the fried rice guy's in the last house, right? And the spaghetti fella's next to him, so he's gotta be in the middle house.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person with a different car and stuff.  

Let me see...  

* The blue person is in the last house, number 5.
* And the white person is in house number 4.

Hmm...  

I think the boots person is in house number **2**.  

Is that right? 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says the history book buff lives in the first house, so it's gotta be **(B) 1**. 



"
"This is a real head-scratcher!  

Let me see...  Lots of folks, lots of stuff they like.  Hmm...  

I'd say the apple eater is in house number **(D) 2**.  

That just feels right to me! 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda flower, a different color, different shoes, and they like different books.

* The history guy's in the middle house, that's for sure.
* And the last house, the fella there's wearin' loafers.
* Oh, and the daffodils are in the middle house too.

Hmm... the yellow-lovin' person can't be in the first or last house.  And the blue-lovin' person's gotta be somewhere after the high heels.

Let me think...

* Boots and the yellow person gotta be next to each other.

I got it! The green person's gotta be in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, shoot, that first house fella must be wearin' them runnin' shoes, that's what it says right there in the clues! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella with a different pet and a different car and they all play somethin' different.

That cricketer fella, he's in the first house for sure. And the truck driver's gotta be after the basketball player.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the basketball player's gotta be in the middle house, right?

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Lots of words and stuff.  

Let me see... tulips...  I think the tulips are in house number **(C) 5**.  

Hope that's right! 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it, and they all got different stuff. Like, one wears fancy shoes, one's got a truck, one ate somethin' like stew, and one likes root beer.

There's a bunch of clues, but lemme see...

* The root beer guy and the fried rice eater live next door to each other.
* The loafer guy lives right next to the grilled cheese eater.
* The high heel lady ain't in the last house.
* The milk drinker's in the third house.
* The root beer guy lives right next to the SUV guy.
* There's two houses between the sedan and the water drinker.
* The runnin' shoe guy's in the second house.
* The convertible guy lives right next to the water drinker.
* The spaghetti eater ain't in the first house.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.  

Let me think...

Hmmm... I think the sedan guy is in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see... so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a fella in it who likes different stuff.  

One guy drinks water, one likes tea, one's a milk drinker, and the last one's all about that root beer. Then there's shoes - sandals, loafers, boots, and runnin' shoes. And they all play somethin' different - flute, cello, sax, and violin. Oh, and they ate different things for lunch too - grilled cheese, stew, fried rice, and pizza.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.

Let me think... the clues say the cello player is right next to the tea drinker, and the tea drinker's in the last house. So the cello player must be in the third house.

(C) 3 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person livin' in it.  They all like different stuff, like sports and drinks and flowers.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?  They give ya clues, and you gotta figure out who lives where.

Hmmm... lemme see...

* The minivan's in the last house, that's easy.
* And the root beer guy's in the third house.

Let's see... the basketball fella is right next to the truck guy.

Oh! And the truck guy is right next to the flower guy with the carnations.

I think... I think the truck guy lives in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff. One's a tea drinker, one likes coffee, and one's a water guy.  They also got different cars and read different books and eat different fruits.

That tea fella, he's in the first house, that's easy. And the apple eater's gotta be somewhere before the minivan guy.  

Hmm... the sci-fi reader's gotta be before the convertible guy...

Oh, and the fantasy book guy and the coffee drinker can't be right next to each other.

And the orange eater ain't in the middle house.

Let me think...

I got it! The coffee drinker's gotta be in the second house.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff. One likes red, one likes yellow, and one likes white. And they all read different books too - one's into fantasy, one likes romance, and one's a mystery buff.

Okay, so the red guy's in the middle house, 'cause it says he's right next to the mystery reader. And the mystery reader's gotta be in the last house.

That means the fantasy guy can't be in the first house, and the white guy can't be in the last house.

So, by golly, the fantasy guy's gotta be in the first house!

**(C) 1** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says right here the SUV guy lives in the third house. So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

Three houses, huh?  And they got different stuff in 'em.  

*One fella's got a TV, another's got a gameboy, and the other's got a radio.

*One's eatin' apples, one's eatin' bananas, and one's eatin' kiwis.

*One's got tulips, one's got roses, and one's got lilies.

*One plays guitar, one plays the violin, and one plays the flute.

*One drinks root beer, one drinks tea, and one drinks coffee.

Okay, so... the TV guy is right next to the tea drinker, but the tea drinker ain't in the middle house.  And the kiwi eater is somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

The flute player ain't right next to the banana eater, there's one house in between 'em.

And the tulips are somewhere to the right of the radio.

Oh, and the roses are in the middle house.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

Let me think...

...

I think the root beer lover is in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person in it. One likes mysteries, one likes them fantasy books, one's all about history, and the last one's a sci-fi nut.

And they're all eatin' different stuff too - mangos, kiwis, bananas, and apples. Plus, they got different shoes on - sandals, high heels, runnin' shoes, and boots.

It's a whole mess, but I think I got it figured out...

The sci-fi person's gotta be in house number **4**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's two houses, right? One guy eats spaghetti, the other eats fried rice. One plays the flute, one plays the cello. One wears loafers, one wears sandals. One likes white, one likes green. One has a sedan, one has a SUV.

Hmm... the fried rice guy don't live in the first house. And the SUV guy don't live in the second house.  The flute player is next to the white-lovin' guy, and the loafer guy is next to the white-lovin' guy too.

So, I think the sandal guy must be in the second house.

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a different person livin' in it. They all got different stuff, like flowers and fruit and cars.

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

One guy drinks only water, and he lives next to the guy with the minivan. The water drinker ain't in the first house. And the last house, the third one, that's where the root beer lover lives.

Oh, and the sedan is somewhere before the guy eatin' mangos.

I think... I think the violinist lives in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it with different stuff.  Shoes, colors they like, what they ate, all that jazz.

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the guy with the loafers lives in house number **(B) 4**.

Hope that's right! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one house has a computer and the other a TV. And one has lilies and the other roses.  

The fella with the lilies don't live in the first house. And the TV guy is in the first house.

That means the computer gotta be in the other house, right?

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Two houses, two folks... one likes pizza, one likes spaghetti. One's got tulips, one's got daffodils. One reads 'bout history, one reads 'bout spaceships. One plays baseball, one plays golf. One plays guitar, one plays drums...

That science fiction fella, he's gotta be in the first house, 'cause the golfer's gotta be after him.  And the pizza guy and the history guy are right next to each other.

The guitar player's gotta be after the daffodils, so he's in the second house.

That means the drummer's gotta be in the first house.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...  

There's these five houses, right? And each one's got a different fella in it with a pet, somethin' they play, and some kinda gadget.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think I got it figured out.  

The percussionist, that fella's gotta be in house number **2**. 

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One's got lilies and the other don't. One guy's eatin' apples, the other oranges. One's a swimmer, one's a basketball player. One's got a radio, one's got a computer. And one plays the piano, the other the violin.

Hmm...  Let's see... the radio's gotta be in the house on the right, 'cause it's to the right of the apples and the violin guy.  And the lilies are in the first house.  So... the violin guy's gotta be in the first house, right?

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different fella livin' in it. They all like different sports and ate different stuff for lunch.

The tennis guy lives in the middle house, the third one. And the fella who likes grilled cheese lives in the last house. The golfer's in the fourth house.

Now, it says the fried rice and spaghetti guys live kinda far apart, not next to each other. And the pizza guy lives somewhere before the cricket guy. Oh, and the stew guy is right next to the spaghetti guy.

And the tennis guy is before the soccer guy.

Hmmm... lemme think...  

I think the cricket guy lives in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these two houses, right? One guy eats stew, the other eats spaghetti. One likes white, one likes red. One drinks water, one drinks milk. One plays baseball, one swims. One wears runnin' shoes, one wears loafers.

Hmm...

That fella in runnin' shoes, he don't live in the first house. And the white-lovin' guy lives next to the spaghetti eater.  Oh, and the baseball player and spaghetti guy are neighbors, and so are the water drinker and spaghetti guy.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

Let me think...

I bet the loafer guy is in the first house.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella eatin' somethin' different - grapes, oranges, or mangos. And they each like a different drink - coffee, root beer, or water.

Let's see... the coffee guy lives somewhere before the mango fella. And the water drinker lives after the root beer guy. Oh, and the root beer guy ain't in the middle house, and neither is the orange eater.

Hmmm... if the root beer guy ain't in the middle, and the orange eater ain't either, then the mango guy must be in the middle house. That means the coffee guy's gotta be in the first house.

So, that leaves the last house for the root beer guy and the water drinker.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' different stuff. One's got spaghetti, one's got pizza, and one's got that rice thingy. And they're all wearin' different shoes too.

Hmm... the rice guy ain't in the middle house. And the boots guy is right next to him, on the left. Oh, and the spaghetti fella's in the first house.

So, if the rice guy's not in the middle, and the boots guy's next to him, that means the rice guy's gotta be in the last house, and the boots guy's in the middle.

That leaves the loafers guy... gotta be in the middle house, right?

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"This is a real head-scratcher!  

Let me see...  Lots of words and stuff.  

Hmm... I think the mystery book reader lives in house number **(A) 4**.  

That's my guess anyway! 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person in it.  They got different shoes, pets, drinks, and flowers.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the lilies are in house number **(E) 4**.  

It took me a while to figure it out, but I just kept thinkin' about where everything could go. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

The mystery guy's in the first house, right? And the tennis fella ain't in the first house. So, the bookworm who likes all that fantasy stuff gotta be in the second house, I reckon.

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it doin' different stuff.  

They all play different music things, wear different shoes, ate different foods, got different flowers, and like different colors.

It's a whole mess, but lemme see...

* The sandals guy lives right next to the spaghetti eater.
* The stew eater is somewhere before the spaghetti eater.
* The roses ain't in the first house.
* The runnin' shoes guy is right next to the daffodil guy.
* The pizza guy and the daffodil guy are best buds, livin' right next door.
* The white lover is somewhere after the runnin' shoes guy.
* The lilies guy is right before the guitar player.
* The daffodil guy ain't in the third house.
* The green lover and the piano player are two houses apart, and the green lover is before the piano player.
* The blue lover is before the pizza guy.
* The lilies guy is after the violin player.
* The loafers guy is in the last house.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.

So, where's the white lover livin'?  

I think it's house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all like different stuff, like colors and drinks and stuff.  

There's a bunch of clues, but lemme see...

* The golfer ain't in the last house.
* Neither is the violinist.
* And the person with the fancy shoes ain't in the last house neither.

Hmm...

* The cello player is in the first house.

Okay, that's a start.

* The basketball player is somewhere before the person who likes red.

* The flute player is somewhere after the boots person.

* And the flute player is before the yellow lover.

* The basketball player is after the running shoes person.

* Yellow lover is right next to the milk drinker.

* The flute player is after the cricket player.

* The blue lover is after the root beer lover.

* The water drinker is before the coffee drinker.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!

Let me think...

(After some scribbling and muttering)

I think the water drinker is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says the fella who likes red is in the first house. So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person livin' in it.  They got different pets, gadgets, shoes, they play different sports, and even got different flowers in their houses.

There's a bunch of clues, but lemme see...

* The swimmer guy is in the fourth house, that's for sure.
* And the fella with the runnin' shoes is in the first house.
* Oh, and the boots guy is in the third house.

Hmm, this is tricky.  Let me think...

...

Okay, I think the guy with the lilies is in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, one house has kiwis, the other has apples. One guy's got a bird, the other a dog. One plays tennis, the other cricket. One reads mysteries, the other sci-fi. And one wears sandals, the other high heels.

Hmm... the kiwi guy's in the first house, and the sci-fi dude's in the second.  The bird and high heels are together, and the tennis player and apple guy are together too.  

Oh! The dog guy can't be in the first house. So he must be in the first house, right?

That means the cricket guy must be in the first house too!

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person with a pet and they all ate somethin' different and play different sports and eat different fruits. That's a lot to keep track of!

Let me see...  

* The guy with the pizza is in the last house.
* And the swimmer is eatin' oranges, I think.

Hmm... this is hard.  

* Oh! The fish guy is in the middle house.

Gosh, I don't know...  

Wait a minute...

I think the grape eater is in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with somethin' different.  One's got a fancy car, one's got a truck, one's got a minivan, and one's got one of them SUV things. They all ate somethin' different too, like stew and pizza and stuff. And they got flowers in their houses, and they like different colors.

It says the green-lovin' guy's in the first house. And the pizza guy's right next to the blue-lovin' fella.  The fried rice guy's in the last house.

Hmmm...  

I think the pizza guy's in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one guy's got grapes, the other's got mangos. One's drivin' a fancy car, the other a minivan. And one plays cricket, the other baseball.

The baseball fella's in the second house, and he's got that fancy car.  And the grape guy ain't in the first house...

So, the mango guy's gotta be in the first house, right?

**(A)** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' somethin' different. One's got apples, one's got kiwis, and one's got oranges. And they each like a different color too - blue, white, or green.

Well, that blue fella, he's in the middle house, the second one. And the kiwi guy's gotta be in the last house 'cause the blue fella's gotta be before him.

And the white fella, he's gotta be after the green fella.

So, if the blue fella's in the middle and the kiwi fella's last, the green fella's gotta be first. That means the white fella's gotta be last too.

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these two houses, right? One's got a rose bouquet, the other don't. And the root beer guy, he's gotta be next to the roses, but on the other side.

That means the roses gotta be in the first house, right? 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person in it. One likes cats, one likes fishies, one's got horses, and one's got a dog. And they all got different cars too - a sedan, a big ol' SUV, a minivan, and a truck.

Now, they gave us some clues, see?

One says the minivan's gotta be to the right of the fishy person. Another says the truck's right next to the sedan, and the fishy person's right next to the dog person. And the truck's two houses away from the dog person. Oh, and the cat person ain't in the second house.

Hmm... lemme think...

If the truck's next to the sedan, and the minivan's gotta be on the right side, and the fishy person's next to the dog person...  

I think the dog person's gotta be in house number **3**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Okay, so the root beer guy is in the second house, and the yellow lover is in the third.  And the blue lover gotta be after the yellow one... so that means blue is in the last house!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Let me see...  

Okay, so there are three houses, right? And each person in the house is different. One likes oranges, one likes grapes, and one likes mangos.  

*scratches head*

And they all got different pets and shoes and stuff.  

*mumbles to self*

Okay, so the cricketer is somewhere to the right of the orange eater... and the baseball player is somewhere to the left of the cat lover...

*paces back and forth*

This is hard!

*looks up suddenly*

Wait a minute! I think the bird keeper is in house number **(B) 3**! 

Yeah, that sounds right. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different person doin' different stuff.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the tennis player lives in house number **(A) 2**. 

Hope that's right! 



"
"This is a real head-scratcher!  

Let's see...  They give ya all these clues about folks livin' in houses and what they like.  

Hmmm...  I think the history book buff is in house number **(A) 3**.  

That's my best guess anyway! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella plays the guitar, the other the cello. One's got a computer, the other a game thingamajig. And one's got a dog, the other likes fishy fishies.

The cello player's next to the game guy, and the dog ain't in the first house.

That means the dog's gotta be in the second house, right?

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with a different kinda car and gadget.

We know the fella in the third house has a Gameboy, and the first house guy drives a minivan.  

The phone guy lives next to the SUV guy, and the radio guy is somewhere after the Gameboy fella.

Oh, and the convertible ain't in the third house, and the computer guy ain't in the first house.

Hmmm...  Let me think...

I reckon the SUV guy must be in the second house. 


So the answer is (D). 

"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's five houses, right? And each one's got a different flower and a different thingamajig.

* House number 3 has tulips, that's for sure.
* And house number 2 has that computer thingy.

Hmm... the phone's gotta be next to the TV, and the lilies are somewhere after the phone.

Oh, and the daffodils are after the radio, but not in house number 4.

Let me think... I think the carnations are in house number 5.

So the answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see... five houses in a row, right?  And each one's got a different kinda person livin' in it.  

Hmm, let's see... the cricketer's in the second house, and the golfer's in the fourth.  Oh, and the fish guy's in the second house too.  

The bird guy's in the first house, and the sandals fella is in the third.  

*scratches head*

Hold on... the baseball guy's gotta be in the fifth house, 'cause he's gotta be to the right of the sandals guy.

That means the dog guy's gotta be in the third house!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One guy likes root beer, the other likes water. One's eatin' a banana, the other grapes. One had pizza, one had stew. One drives a truck, one drives a minivan. And one's got a radio, the other a computer.

Hmm... lemme see...

The radio guy and the truck guy live next to each other. And the radio guy is somewhere to the left of the pizza guy. Oh, and the root beer guy doesn't live in the first house.  And the grape guy is right next to the computer guy.

Gosh, that's a lot to think about!

I think... I think the pizza guy lives in house number **2**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all ate somethin' different, like one had pizza, one had that cheesy sandwich, and so on. They also like different colors and drinks.

It says the tea drinker is in the first house, and the pizza guy is next to him.  And the milk drinker is somewhere before the spaghetti eater. Oh, and the water drinker and the white lover are right next to each other.

Hmmm... I think the green lover is in house number 3.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see... there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person in it.  

They got pets, like dogs and horses, and they all wear different shoes, drink different stuff, and like different colors.  

It's a whole mess, but I think... I think the fella who likes red lives in house number **2**.

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the person with the lilies lives in house number **(D) 2**.

I just kinda figured it out by thinkin' about where everyone else is and what they like.  It's like a puzzle, ya know? 



"
"Okay, lemme see... so there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff. One's a golfer, one plays basketball, and one's a soccer guy. They also ate different stuff for lunch - grilled cheese, spaghetti, and pizza. And they got different flowers in their houses - lilies, daffodils, and tulips.

Hmm... let me think...

The soccer guy's in the last house, that's for sure. And the tulips ain't in the last house neither. So they gotta be in one of the first two houses.

The golfer's gotta be next to the basketball guy, so they're in the first two houses too.

And the lilies are right next to the grilled cheese...

I think the grilled cheese is in the middle house.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

It says the fella who ate fried rice is in the same house as the piano player, and the piano player is in the third house. So... it's gotta be the third house!

(D) 3 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all got different shoes and ate different stuff for lunch and like different drinks.

That tea drinker fella, he's in the third house.  And the stew eater is somewhere before the spaghetti eater.  The root beer guy is after the sandal wearer, and the water drinker is after the grilled cheese eater. Oh, and the grilled cheese eater ain't in the first house.

Let me think... think... think...

Alright, I got it! The computer guy is in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, one guy likes sci-fi books, and the other likes history books. And one ate pizza, and the other ate fried rice.  

The fried rice guy lives on the right side of the sci-fi guy. That means the sci-fi guy gotta be in the first house, right?

**(B) 1** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one house has a piano player, right? And the other one has horses.  The root beer drinker is on the same side as the horses, but not in the same house. And the white-lovin' person ain't in the second house.

That means the dog person gotta be in the second house, right?

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's four houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person in it. One likes history books, one likes lovey-dovey books, one likes space books, and one likes those magic books.

They all ate somethin' different too - rice, noodles, pizza, and some kinda stew. And they all play different music things - one's got a fiddle, one bangs on stuff, one plays a windy thing, and one plays a guitar.

Hmm... let's see... the stew guy's in the second house, and the pizza guy's in the last one. The bangin' guy's gotta be after the space book guy, and the history guy's gotta be after the bangin' guy.

Oh, and the guitar guy's gotta be before the fiddle guy.

...

I think the bangin' guy's in the third house. 


(B)

"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff.  

One likes white, one likes green, and one likes yellow.  They got flowers too, one has lilies, one has tulips, and one has daffodils. And they all got pets, like a bird, horses, and a dog. Oh, and they wear different shoes, boots, running shoes, and sandals.

It says the white-liking person is in the first house. And the person with the daffodils is next to them.  And the horses are next to the daffodils. So the horses gotta be in the first house too!

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it with different stuff. One's got boots, one's got fancy shoes, and one's got those slip-on things. Then there's flowers, colors, and what kinda books they like.

It says the sci-fi guy's in the middle house. And the fella with the slip-on shoes and the red-lovin' guy live next to each other.  The white-lovin' guy's next to the flower guy, and the history guy's on the other side of the flower guy. Oh, and the boots guy ain't in the last house.

Hmmm...  I think the boots guy must be in the middle house.

So the answer is (C).

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a different thingamajig, like a computer or a radio, and some flowers, and they all like different sports.

Hmm... that tennis player fella, he's gotta be in one of the first two houses, 'cause the TV guy is further down the line. And the golfer ain't in the middle house.

Oh, and the computer and the tulips are right next to each other!

Let me think... I think the computer's gotta be in the first house. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different person doin' different stuff.  

They play different music things, got different flowers, play different sports, and wear different shoes.  

That's a lot to keep track of!

Let's see... the swimmer's in the third house, and the violinist's in the second. The daffodils are in the last house, and the cricketer's in the fourth.

Hmm... sandals are next to tulips, and runnin' shoes are next to daffodils.

Hmm...

I think it's house number **2**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?  You gotta figure out who eats what and where they live.

"Okay, lemme see... so there's these houses, right? And folks livin' in 'em, each one likes different books and plays somethin' different.

Hmm... the mystery reader's in the fourth house, and the sax guy's there too.  And the percussion fella's gotta be right before the romance reader...

Oh! That means the history buff's in the second house, and the guitar player's in the last one.

The romance reader's gotta be before the fantasy reader, so the fantasy reader's in the last house too.

And since the sax and violin guys are next to each other, the violin guy's gotta be in the third house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different dude with a different thingamajig and different shoes.

The TV guy's in the last house, that's easy. And the loafers fella is in the second house.  The phone guy ain't in the second house, and the boots guy is somewhere before the loafers guy.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella's got loafers, the other's got fancy shoes. And one likes them history books, the other likes mysteries.

"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella likes mysteries, the other likes fantasy books.  And one plays the piano, the other the cello.  One likes green, one likes red.

The fantasy guy's in the first house, and he plays the cello too.  That means the green guy's in the first house too, 'cause he's gotta be to the left of the red guy.

So, the mystery reader's gotta be in the second house, right?

**Answer: (B) 2** 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And everyone in 'em is different. One eats fancy cheese stuff, one eats stew, one eats rice, one eats pizza, and one eats spaghetti.

"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person doin' different stuff.  Like, one's a baseball player, one eats spaghetti, one has a cat, and so on.  

There's a bunch of clues, but it's all mixed up.  

Hmm... lemme see...

I think the answer is **(A) 2**.  

That's where I'd put the stew eater, anyway. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

One guy's got sandals, the other's got horses.  And the history book fella's gotta be next to the spaghetti eater.  

That don't tell me nothin' about who ate the fried rice though. Could be either one, I guess.

(A) 1 
(B) 2 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, one house has lilies and the other has daffodils, right? And one guy plays the flute and the other plays the saxophone. One drives a fancy car and the other a regular one.

The sedan guy lives somewhere before the lilies. And the flute player doesn't live in the first house.

That means the lilies gotta be in the second house, right?

**(B) 2** 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda person in it. One likes cricket, one likes swimmin', one's all about golf, and the last one's a tennis player.

And they all got different flowers too! Roses, carnations, lilies, and daffodils.

Plus, they each read different books - history, romance, mystery, and fantasy.

Now, there's a bunch of clues, but it's like a puzzle, ya know?

Let me think...

* The mystery reader's gotta be somewhere near the swimmer, but not right next to 'em.
* The tennis player's gotta be on the same side as the mystery reader, but further down the row.
* The carnations are in the last house.
* The fantasy book lover is right next to the swimmer.
* The golfer's somewhere after the daffodils.
* The roses are in the third house.
* The tennis player ain't in the last house.
* The daffodils are somewhere before the roses.
* The mystery reader and the romance reader are a couple houses apart.

Hmm...

After thinkin' real hard, I reckon the romance book lover is in **house 4 (B)**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person in it.  They all like different drinks and stuff, and have different things in their houses.

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the person with the tulips lives in house number... **(D) 4**.

Hope that's right! 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one has a fella livin' in it. They all got different shoes, ate different stuff for lunch, drive different cars, play different sports, and got different flowers in their house.

That's a lot to keep track of!

* The guy with the boots lives right next to the minivan guy.
* The pizza eater is somewhere to the right of the rose guy.
* The runnin' shoe guy don't live in the first house.
* The cricket fella lives right next to the tulip guy.
* The pizza guy don't live in the second house.
* The grilled cheese guy is somewhere to the right of the sedan guy.
* The minivan guy lives in the third house.
* The golfer lives in the first house.
* The rose guy don't live in the second house.

Hmm...

Let me think...

I reckon the rose guy lives in the **first house (A)**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

Five houses in a row, huh?  And they all got different stuff goin' on. Drinks, music, food, colors... that's a lot to keep track of!

Let me think...  

*Coffee next to pizza, milk way before blue, sax guy's in the middle house...*

*Scratches head*

This is harder than it looks!

*Mumbles to self*

Okay, so the cellist and spaghetti guy are buddies, and the stew and water folks hang out too...

*Taps fingers on table*

Wait a minute... I think I got it!

The percussionist is in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it who eats somethin' different and likes a different color.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?

They give ya some clues, like the green-lovin' person don't live in the second house, and the stew eater ain't in the second or fourth house.

And the red lover is right next to the stew eater.

Oh, and the fried rice guy lives in the third house.

Hmm... lemme think...

I think the white lover lives in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, the red lover's in the last house, right? And the drummer's in the middle one.  The basketball fella gotta be after the tennis guy, but can't be last.  

That means the basketball player's gotta be in the middle house, right?

So the answer is (C) 2. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Let me see... houses, flowers, music...  

I think the answer is (B) 2.  

I dunno how I know, it just feels right! 



"
"Okay, so you got these houses, right? And each one's got a different thing goin' on. Flowers, music, cars, books, and pets.  

They give you a bunch of clues, like who lives next to who and stuff. It's kinda like a puzzle, ya know?

You gotta figure out where the minivan guy lives.  

Hmm... lemme think...

I'd say the minivan guy lives in house number **(D) 4**. 

That's my guess anyway! 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person livin' in it.  They got different stuff like radios and cars and flowers and pets.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the tulips are in house number **(B) 4**.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, ya know? You gotta figure out who's got what and where they live. Took me a while to wrap my head around it, but I think I got it! 



"
"Okay, lemme see... so there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff.  

One guy's got a fish, one's got a dog, and one's got a cat.  They all ate somethin' different too - spaghetti, stew, or pizza. And they play different sports and like different drinks.

Hmm... let's see...

* The basketball player's in the first house, and he plays the saxophone too.
* The cricketer's in the second house, and the tea drinker's right next to him.
* The pizza guy's in the first house, and the dog guy's right next to him.

So, the dog guy's gotta be in house number two.

**(A)** 2 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these two houses, right? One's got a cat person, the other's got a fishy person. One's got a computer, one's got a radio. One likes lovey-dovey books, the other likes old history stuff. And one's got lilies, the other's got daffodils. Oh, and one's wearin' fancy shoes, the other's got comfy loafers.

Hmm... the history buff's in the first house, and the cat person ain't in the second house.  The fancy shoes are in the first house, and the daffodils are in the second.

So, the lilies gotta be in the first house, right?

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda flower and a person who plays somethin' different and eats different stuff.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the pizza guy lives in house number **(D) 4**.

Hope that helps! 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?  You gotta figure out who likes what and where they live.

Hmmm... lemme think...

I think the cellist lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it playin' a different tune and eatin' different fruit.

The piano player and the kiwi guy gotta be next to each other, and the flute fella's gotta be on the right side of the violin guy. Oh, and the grape guy's gotta be one house away from the kiwi guy, and the violin guy's gotta be one house away from the kiwi guy too.

That makes me think the piano player's gotta be in the last house, number 3. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

The kiwi guy is in the first house, right? And the fantasy reader ain't in the first house... so they gotta be in the second one!

(B) 2 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

It says the fella who likes red is in the third house.  

So the answer is (D) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one fella's a piano player and the other one plays the cello, right? And one likes root beer and the other likes tea.

That root beer guy can't be in the second house, so he must be in the first one. Makes sense, right?

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, lemme see... so there's these five houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it wearin' different shoes and havin' different flowers.  

* The boots guy and the carnations fella live right next door to each other.
* The tulips guy is right next to the loafers guy.
* The sandals guy ain't in the last house.
* There's one house between the runnin' shoes guy and the lilies guy.
* The tulips guy is somewhere to the right of the daffodils guy.
* The tulips guy ain't in the fourth house.
* The carnations guy is in the last house.
* The daffodils guy and the runnin' shoes guy live right next to each other.

Hmm...  Let me think...

I reckon the lilies guy is in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, see? You gotta figure out who lives where based on what they like.

Hmmm... lemme think...

I think the pianist lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' somethin' different. One's got spaghetti, one's got fried rice, and one's got stew.

They also like different colors - white, green, and red - and wear different shoes - boots, runnin' shoes, and high heels.

Hmm... let me think...

* The high heel guy don't live in the last house.
* The white-lovin' fella's in the first house.
* Spaghetti ain't in the second house.
* The green-lovin' guy's in the second house.
* Boots are right next to the high heels.
* Boots are somewhere before the stew guy.
* Stew ain't in the second house neither.

Gosh, this is tricky!

Alright, so if the white guy's first, and green guy's second, and boots are next to high heels, that means the boots guy's first and the high heel guy's second.

And since the stew guy comes after the boots guy, he must be in the last house.

That leaves the fried rice for the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda flower and a different book person.

Hmm... the rose person is in the second house, that's for sure. And the sci-fi person is next to 'em, but not on the left. So, the sci-fi person must be in house three!

The romance person is next to the tulips, and they gotta be to the right of the carnations. So, the tulips are in the last house, and the romance person is in the third house.

That means the carnations are in the second house, right next to the roses.

So, the last house, the fourth one, gotta be the lilies!

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, the science guy lives in the first house, right? And the coffee drinker is somewhere before the sandal wearin' fella.  That means the sandal guy must be in the second house, and the romance book lover gotta be in there too!

So it's gotta be **(B) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  So one guy plays drums and the other plays piano, right? And one's got a radio and one's got a phone.  

That fella with the drums is next to the radio guy. So the drummer must have the phone, I reckon.

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, the fella in the middle house drives a fancy convertible, right? And the yellow lover is right next to the guy with the sedan.  

That means the yellow lover gotta be in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff.  

Shoes, cars, and pets... that's a lot to keep track of!

Let me see... the running shoes guy is in the first house. And the sedan is in the third house.

Hmm... the dog ain't in the third house, and the sandals are somewhere before the bird guy.

Oh, and the bird guy is two houses away from the running shoes fella.

This is makin' my head hurt!

Wait a minute... the fish guy is somewhere after the SUV guy, but not in the third house.

And the high heels lady is right next to the truck guy.

Hold on... the loafers ain't in the last house, and neither is the fish guy.

The dog ain't in the first house neither, and the horse guy is after the minivan guy.

Whew! That's a lot to think about.

I think... I think the horse guy is in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person livin' in it. They got flowers, cars, fruits, pets, and shoes.  

It's a whole mess of clues, but lemme see...

* The convertible's in the first house, and the loafers are in the second.
* The bird keeper's in the first house too.

Hmm... let me think...

* Oh yeah! The truck's gotta be in house number **(C) 5**.

That's what I think anyway! 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' different stuff. One's got rice, one's got spaghetti, and one's got that melty cheese sandwich.

And they all like different books too. One's into them space stories, one likes the ones with dragons and stuff, and one likes the mystery ones.

Well, it says the rice guy is in the middle house. And the dragon book fella is in the middle house too. So they're the same guy!

That means the spaghetti guy's gotta be in the first house, and the space story guy's in the first house too.

That leaves the last house for the mystery book fella and the cheese sandwich guy.

So the answer's gotta be (C). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, one house has tulips and the other has carnations, and one person has a dog and the other has horses.  It says the carnations are somewhere to the left of the dog.  That means the carnations gotta be in house number 1, right?

(B) 1 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

The kiwi guy's in house number two, right? And the water drinker is next to the high heel person... so the high heel person must be in house number two too!

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One guy's got a TV, the other's got a phone. One's wearin' fancy shoes, the other sandals. One likes tea, one likes water. And one's eatin' kiwis, the other grapes.

Hmm... it says the fancy shoes are to the left of the sandals, and the grape eater and sandal wearer are next to each other. So it's gotta be fancy shoes, grapes, then sandals.

And the tea drinker's gotta be to the left of the TV person.

I think... I think the kiwi eater's in house number **2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes somethin' different to drink and plays a different thing.

The tea guy's in the first house, that's for sure. And the water drinker's gotta be after the cello player.

The violinist can't be in the last house, and he's gotta be next to the guitar player...

Thinkin'... thinkin'...

Gotta be the last house, right?

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, there's these houses, right? And folks in 'em wearin' different shoes and drinkin' different stuff.  

That fella in the third house, he's wearin' sandals and likes milk. And the water drinker is right next to him, so that's gotta be house number four.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see... five houses, five folks, and they all got different stuff and ate different things.  

* One guy's got a phone, one's got a game thing, one's got a computer, one's got a radio, and one's got a TV.
* They ate spaghetti, pizza, stew, grilled cheese, and fried rice.

Hmm... let me think...

* The game thing and the computer gotta be next to each other.
* The TV's gotta be somewhere before the phone.
* Grilled cheese and the radio are one house apart.
* The game thing and the fried rice are one house apart too.
* Grilled cheese is right before spaghetti.
* The radio ain't in the fourth house.
* Pizza's in the fourth house.
* The computer ain't in the fourth house neither.

Alright, so if pizza's in the fourth house, and the computer ain't there, then spaghetti's gotta be in the... fourth house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person doin' different stuff.  Like, one plays music, one plays sports, eats different fruits, has pets, and ate somethin' for lunch.

There's a bunch of clues, but it's like a puzzle, ya know? You gotta figure out who's doin' what and where they live.

After thinkin' about it for a bit, I think the person eatin' a banana lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, one guy plays drums, the other plays guitar. One ate pizza, one ate grilled cheese. One has a dog, one has a bird.

The grilled cheese guy lives to the right of the bird guy. And the drummer doesn't live in the second house.

That means the drummer must be in the first house, right?  'Cause if he was in the second, the grilled cheese guy couldn't be to his right.

So, the pizza guy must be in the first house too!

**(B) 1** 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says the bird keeper is in the third house. So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all got different pets and stuff, like one's got horses, one likes fish, and one's a cat person.  And they all play different music things, eat different fruits, wear different shoes, and read different kinds of books.

It's a whole mess, but there are clues!

Let me see...

Hmm, the loafers guy doesn't live in the middle house. And neither does the drummer or the fantasy book reader.

Oh, and the fish person lives to the right of the banana eater. And the flute player is to the right of the fish person.

The orange eater is to the right of the piano player, and the fish person is to the right of the running shoe wearer.

And the fantasy book reader is to the left of the flute player.

Oh, and the cat person lives in the first house!

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.

Let me think...

(After some head scratching)

I think the science fiction book fanatic lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it eatin' somethin' different. One's got kiwis, one's got grapes, one's got mangos, and one's got a banana. And they all like different colors too - green, yellow, red, and white.

Now, this is what I figured out:

* The grape guy's in the second house, that's for sure.
* The red fella's gotta be somewhere after the kiwi guy.
* The green and red guys live right next door to each other.
* The white guy and the red guy have one house between 'em.
* The green guy's gotta be before the yellow guy.
* And the white guy and the banana guy have one house between 'em too.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the kiwi guy's gotta be in the first house, right?

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

So, one fella ate stew, the other rice. One's got horses, the other likes kitties. One's munchin' on oranges, the other apples. One's readin' mysteries, the other sci-fi. And one's wearin' runnin' shoes, the other sandals.

That runnin' shoe guy's gotta be next to the orange eater, and the mystery reader's right next to the cat person. Oh, and the mystery reader and stew eater are neighbors too.

Thinkin' 'bout it... the stew eater's gotta be in house number 1, right? 

(B) 1 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda flower, drink, and thingamajig inside.

* The water drinker's in the middle house, that's for sure.
* And the root beer guy's in the first house.
* The daffodils are next to the phone, so the daffodils gotta be in the middle house and the phone's in the last one.
* The TV ain't in the middle house, and it's gotta be to the right of the tulips. So the tulips are in the first house and the TV's in the last one.

That means the milk drinker's gotta be in the first house, right?

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there are these three houses, right? And each one has a fella in it. They all got different shoes and drinks and stuff.

Hmm... lemme see...

* The guy in the first house is wearin' loafers.
* The phone guy is somewhere before the mango fella.
* The grape guy is right next to the water drinker.
* The boots guy ain't in the last house.
* The kiwi guy is next to the milk drinker.
* The boots guy is somewhere after the gameboy guy.
* The kiwi guy ain't in the first house.

Gosh, this is tricky!  

Let me think...

...

...

I think the computer guy is in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

There's three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff. One's a baseball guy, one's a golfer, and one likes cricket. They also got different flowers and pets.

Hmm... the golfer ain't in the last house, and the fish guy's gotta be somewhere before the horse guy. The golfer and baseball fella live right next to each other, and the carnations and horse guy are neighbors too. Oh, and the carnations are before the baseball guy.

The roses are to the left of the daffodils, and the cricket guy ain't in the last house neither.

Gosh, that's a lot to think about!

...

Hold on, I think I got it! The horse guy's gotta be in the **third house**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

Okay, so the first house has the orange eater, and the last house has the horsey person.  The truck has to be next to the fancy car, and the mango and fancy car people are buddies.

That means the truck gotta be in the middle house, right?

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

It's kinda like a puzzle, see?  You gotta figure out who lives where based on what they eat and what they like to read and play.

Hmmm... lemme think...

I think the percussionist lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Lots of words and stuff.  

Let me see...  

I think the mango eater is in house number **(A) 5**. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these five houses, right? And each one's got a person with a fave color, a thing they play music on, and some gadget.

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think I got it figured out.

The sax player's gotta be in house number **1**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

There's two houses, right? One's got a tea drinker and the other's got a root beer fella. One plays the cello, one plays the guitar. One's got horses, one's got a kitty cat. And one likes mysteries, the other likes history books.

They said the cello player is somewhere before the mystery reader, and the history buff is before the cat person. Oh, and the root beer drinker and guitar player live right next to each other.

Gosh, that's a lot to keep track of!  I dunno, it could be either house, couldn't it?

(A) 1
(B) 2 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a different critter and some flowers.

Hmm... the flowers are tricky.  But I know the bird person ain't in the last house 'cause the flowers in that one are carnations. And the dog ain't in the middle house.

That means the dog's gotta be in the first house, right? And if the tulips are after the dog, they gotta be in the middle house.

So the answer is (B), the middle house. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a different dude in it with different stuff.  

It's like a puzzle, see?  

You gotta figure out where the guy with the loafers lives.

Hmm... lemme think...

I think it's house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So, there's these four houses, right? And each one's got a fella eatin' somethin' different. One's got oranges, one's got kiwis, one's got mangos, and one's got a banana. And they all got different pets too - horses, a dog, a bird, and a cat.

Hmm... let's see... the mango guy's in the first house. And the horse guy ain't in the first house.  

Oh, and the bird guy and the kiwi guy live right next to each other.

The banana guy ain't in the third house, and he's right next to the dog guy.

Gosh, this is tricky...

Alright, I think the bird guy's gotta be in house number **3**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, the mystery guy lives in the first house, right? And the lovey-dovey book person can't be in the last house.  

The bird person is right next to the history buff, so they gotta be in the first two houses.

That means the romance book person gotta be in the second house!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

That coffee fella, he's gotta be in house number two.  That's what they said, right?

So the answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says right here the banana eater is in house number 3. 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it, and they're all different. One's got fancy shoes, one's got sneakers, and one's got those slip-on things. They all like different books too, and ate different stuff for lunch. And they got flowers in their houses, and they play different sports.

That's a lot to keep track of!

But there's these clues, see?

One says the stew guy lives to the right of the fancy shoes fella. And the golfer lives next to the daffodils, but not right next to 'em. The rose guy is next to the spaghetti eater, and the soccer fella's in the middle house.

Oh, and the mystery book guy ain't in the middle house neither.

Whew!

After thinkin' real hard, I bet the guy with the carnations lives in the **first house**.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a person in it doin' different stuff. One plays music, one's got fancy shoes, one's got a gadget, and one's got a car.

They gave us some clues, like who's next to who.  

Thinkin' about it... the truck's gotta be in the first house, 'cause the phone's gotta be left of the minivan, and the minivan's gotta be after the truck.

And the cellist is in the last house, 'cause they're next to the minivan.

So, the percussionist... hmm... gotta be in the first house too, 'cause they're before the boots.

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

Apples in house number 4, that's what I think. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a different kinda flower and drink and car.  

That lily person is in the middle house, that's for sure. And the truck's gotta be on the right side, past the minivan.

The coffee person... lemme think... they gotta be next to the rose person, and the SUV person too.

I reckon the coffee person's gotta be in the last house.

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella livin' in it. They all got different cars and stuff, like one's got a fancy convertible, one's got a minivan, and the other's got a truck.

They also ate different things for lunch, like one had grilled cheese, one had spaghetti, and one had stew. And they each like a different color, blue, red, or green. Oh, and they got different flowers in their houses too, roses, daffodils, and lilies.

Now, there's these clues, see?

One says the blue guy lives right next to the spaghetti fella. Another says the stew guy lives somewhere to the left of the lilies. And so on...

After thinkin' about it for a bit, I figured out that the truck guy lives in house number **2**.

"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it. They all like different stuff, like cars and colors and food.

It's kinda confusing, but lemme see...

* The basketball guy is in the last house, and he drives a big SUV.
* The guy who likes white stuff is also in the last house.
* The soccer dude is in the second house.
* And the music guy with the flute is in the third house.

Hmm...  I think the sedan guy is in the **first house**. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, lemme see...

So there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it doin' different stuff. One's got boots, one's got runnin' shoes, and one's got sandals. One's playin' with a gameboy, one's got a phone, and one's watchin' TV. They all like different colors too, blue, red, and white. And they're eatin' different fruits, mangos, grapes, and apples.

Whew, that's a lot!

Alright, so the grapes guy is to the right of the red guy. And the phone guy is right next to the runnin' shoes guy.  The apple guy and the sandals guy are one house apart. Oh, and the gameboy is in the last house, and the red guy is in the middle house.

Hmmm...

I think the phone guy is in the first house. 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  The bird keeper lives in the second house, that's what it says right there. So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's two houses, right? One guy likes tea and the other likes water. One reads love stories, the other likes them space books. One bangs on drums, the other plays that windy thing, whatchamacallit...saxophone! One plays golf, the other baseball. And one eats mangos, the other eats grapes.

Hmm...

The grape guy lives next to the tea drinker AND the baseball player.  And the saxophone player is in the first house.

So, if the saxophone player is in the first house, and the grape guy is next to him, then the baseball player must be in the second house!

That means the mango guy gotta be in the second house too!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it doin' different stuff.  Like, one's eatin' apples, another's playin' the saxophone, and so on.  

There's a bunch of clues, but it's kinda like a puzzle, ya know? You gotta figure out where everyone is based on what they like and what they're doin'.

After thinkin' about it for a bit, I think the romance book lover is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  It says the boots guy is in the first house. So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  Lots of words and stuff.  

Let me see...  I think the tea drinker is in house number **(D) 3**.  

I just kinda guessed, but it sounds right, don't it? 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And everyone in 'em likes somethin' different.  

I gotta figure out where the green-lovin' fella lives. Hmm... lemme see...

* The tea drinker's in the first house, and the roses are next door.
* Tulips are in the last house, and lilies are in the second.

*  Blue's gotta be right next to the pizza guy.

* Root beer ain't in the middle house.

* Fried rice and stew are also close, just one house apart.

* Red's next to green.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of!  

Let me think... think... think...

Aha! I got it! The green lover's in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff. Like, one drives a truck, one has lilies, one eats spaghetti...it's a lot to keep track of!

But there are clues!  

Hmm...let me see...

Whew! That's a lot!

Okay, so... the fried rice guy... lemme think...

I think the fried rice guy lives in house **(D) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, this is a tough one!  

Let's see... grapes are next to the truck, and the yellow lover is before the grapes... and boots are before the mystery books...

Gosh, I dunno.  I'm gonna guess the fantasy book person is in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person with different stuff, like colors they like and what they ate.  

It's a lot to keep track of, but lemme see...

* The green person is in the middle house, number 3.

* And the minivan is next to the fried rice person.

Hmm, this is tricky...

* The minivan is also next to the mystery person, and then the truck.

* Oh, and the romance person is before the mystery person.

"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these four houses, right? And each one's got a person in it who likes different stuff.  

They like different books, play different sports, like different music, have favorite colors, and ate different lunches.

That's a lot to keep track of!

But, one thing I know for sure is the guy who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the third house.

And the golfer lives in the last house, number four.

Oh, and the pizza guy lives right next to the basketball player.

Hmm... I think the pizza guy lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...

So, there's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who plays somethin' different. One's a cello guy, one plays that fiddle thing, and the other bangs on stuff. And they all play different sports too - soccer, basketball, and cricket.

Well, the cello fella lives somewhere after the cricket guy. And the basketball guy's in the middle house. Oh, and the fiddle player's in the middle house too.

That means the soccer guy's gotta be in the first house, right?

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  

There's a bunch of clues about folks and their stuff.  

* The mystery guy's in the last house, and he drinks water too.

I think the tea drinker is in house number **2**. 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so there are these four houses, right? And each one has a person in it who likes different stuff.  

They play different music things, have different pets, drink different stuff, and play different sports. That's a lot to keep track of!

Hmmm... the tennis player isn't in the last house, and neither is the guitarist or the violinist in the third house.

Oh, and the guitarist is somewhere after the cricket player.

This is hard!  

Wait, the dog person and the root beer drinker are next to each other, and the fish person is after the basketball player.

And the water drinker and the tennis player are next to each other too.

Gosh, I'm gettin' a headache!

Let me think...

(After some more thinking and muttering)

I think the fish person is in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Hmm, lemme see...  The piano player is in the second house, right? And the flower person is right next to 'em. So it's gotta be the first house!

(A) 1 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person in it eatin' different stuff and drivin' different cars and havin' different flowers.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but lemme see...

Hmm... let me think...

* Oh yeah, the daffodils are next to the minivan, and the apples are next to the daffodils.

* And the tulips are somewhere before the convertible...

* And there's one house between the carnations and the lilies...

* Oh, and the grapes aren't in the last house.

Gosh, this is tough!  

*Looks at the options*

I think the sedan is in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so there's these two houses, right? One's got a number one and the other's got a number two.  

One fella likes romance books, the other likes mysteries. One likes blue, one likes green. One had pizza, one had grilled cheese. One drinks root beer, one drinks milk. And one plays soccer, one plays golf.

Hmm... let's see... the soccer player's in house number two, that's for sure. And the blue lover is right next to the root beer drinker.  

So, the root beer drinker's gotta be in house number two, right?

**(B)** 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a person who likes different stuff.  

It's kinda like a puzzle.  

Let me see... the daffodils are in the second house, and the yellow-liking person is in the first.  

Hmmm... the red person is next to the lilies, and the lilies are after the swimmer.  

Oh! And the green person is before the swimmer.

"
"Hmm, lemme see...  The fiddler guy is in the first house, right? And the computer thingy is in the same house too, 'cause it's gotta be to the left of the bird person. So the bird person must be in the other house!

(B) 2 



"
"Okay, so there are these five houses, right? And each one has a different kinda person in it.  They got flowers, shoes, stuff like that.  

It's a real head-scratcher, but I think the computer guy is in house number **(A) 3**. 

Hope that helps!

One's got a car, one's got a big truck thing, and one's got a regular car. And they all got different pets, like a kitty cat, a fishy thing, and a dog.

Hmm... let's see... the boots guy is in the middle house. And the fancy shoes lady is right next to the dog person. The regular car is in the last house. And the kitty cat person is in the first house.

Oh! I got it! The sneakers gotta be in the last house, right?

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so lemme see...

There's these three houses, right? And each one's got a fella in it who likes different stuff. One likes tea, one likes milk, and one likes coffee.  They also got different shoes and eat different fruits.

Hmm... let me see...

The mystery guy lives in the first house, and the history guy is right next to him.  Oh, and the mystery guy is next to the TV too. That means the history guy must have the TV.
