"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got four houses, each with a different resident and their quirks.  

Think of it like setting traps. We know the flutist is holed up in the second house. That's our starting point. Now, the lilies are right next to the carnations, and the tulips are right next to the guitarist.  

We also know the pianist is one house away from the flutist.  

Putting it all together, the tulips have to be in the first house to make room for everyone else.

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target - the cellist's house.

We know the green-lover is in the first house, and they're munching on kiwis. That narrows things down. Now, the root beer drinker is somewhere to the right of the water drinker, and the TV watcher is to the left of the root beer drinker. That's a good trail to follow.

The cellist is one house away from the gameboy player, and the blue-lover is right next to the gameboy player.  We can use that to corner our target.

After piecing together all the clues, it's clear the cellist is holed up in **house number 3**. 

**(C)** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail of clues, and piece together the whole picture.

Think of each house as a hunting blind, and each person inside as a different animal. We need to figure out where the one who likes green is hiding.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll give you a tip: pay close attention to the clues about who's next to who. That's like following tracks - it'll lead you straight to your target.

After you've carefully considered all the clues, you'll be able to pinpoint the house number.

My gut tells me the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta follow the trail of clues carefully.

Think of it like this: each house is a different hunting ground, and each characteristic is a sign left behind.

The truck is always gonna be near the SUV, like a pack of wolves. The loafers are close to the convertible, maybe a pair of hunters heading out.

The high heels are in the third house, a lone hunter maybe, setting a trap.

Now, the grapes are always gonna be to the right of the coffee, like a scent trail leading you to the kill.

Keep following those trails, connecting the clues. The running shoes are after the spaghetti, the truck is before the fried rice, and the coffee is always after the pizza.

The root beer is before the running shoes, and the pizza and mangos are side by side, like two animals grazing together.

After you've mapped out all the signs, you'll find the tea drinker is holed up in **House 2**. 

(A) 2 



"
"Listen up, this is a simple tracking problem.  The trail leads straight to house number five. That's where you'll find your target.

**(A) 5** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  Think of it like tracking prey - gotta follow the signs.

The key here is to see how the clues connect.  The soccer player's gotta be left of the orange eater, and the daffodil person's right of the orange eater. That means they're in a line: Soccer - Orange - Daffodil.

Now, the swimmer's right next to the daffodil person.  And the tulip person's gotta be right of the mango eater.

Putting it all together, the only way it fits is: Mango - Tulip - Soccer - Orange - Swimmer - Daffodil.

That means the daffodil person's in **house number 6**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Think of it like this: each house is a different hunting blind, and we gotta figure out who's holed up where.

* We know the violinist's in the first blind. That's our starting point.
* Now, the daffodils gotta be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the history buff's gotta be to the right of the tulips.

Keep piecin' together those clues, seein' how they connect. It's like followin' tracks - one clue leads to another.

Eventually, you'll flush out the answer.  And remember, patience is key. Don't rush the hunt.

The tulips are in **(B) 2**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: each house is a different hunting blind, and we need to figure out who's got what gear in each one.

* We know the bird watcher ain't in the first or last blind. That puts 'em smack dab in the middle.
* The mystery reader's in the middle blind too.
* The fishin' enthusiast ain't in the first blind either.

Now, the history buff's right next to the lilies, so they must be in the first blind, and the lilies are in the middle.

The gameboy's right next to the roses, which means the gameboy's in the first blind, and the roses are in the last.

Finally, the percussionist is right next to the computer guy.

Putting it all together, the gameboy's in the **first house (A)**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, until you corner your target.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot.  We need to figure out where the phone is stashed.

Now, I can't just give you the answer, that'd be like shooting a rabbit in a cage. You gotta use your instincts.

But I will say this: pay close attention to the relationships between the clues.  Who's next to who? What's on either side of something else? That's where the real trail lies.

Good luck, and happy hunting!

**(A) 5** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry.  We know the convertible's parked next to the history books. That means the history buff's gotta be in the second house. Now, the boots ain't in the first house, so they belong to the fella in the second house too.  That leaves the sandals for the first house.

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got four houses, each with a different resident and their quirks.  

Think of it like setting traps. We know the golfer's in the first house, that's our starting point. Now, the swimmer's always lurking near the romance reader, always one house to the left.  Can't be in the third house, so they must be in the second, with the romance reader right next door in the third.

The mystery reader's a sneaky one, gotta be next to the history buff.  Since the golfer's already bagged in the first house, the mystery reader's gotta be in the second.

Finally, the basketball player's a bit of a loner, can't be in the last house.  Process of elimination puts them in the third house.

So, the basketball player's in **(A) 3**. 




"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry.  The mystery reader's trail is clear as day. They're holed up in house number **3**.  You can bet on that. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got three targets, each with their own gear and a favorite color.  

Think of it like this: we're stalking prey in a line. The green one is always just ahead of the one with the gameboy, and the gameboy is always ahead of the computer. We also know the yellow one isn't in the middle.

Following those tracks, the only way this works is if the computer is in the last house.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got four houses, each with a resident who's got their own quirks.  Think of it like tracking four different animals - each leaving behind clues about their habits.

We know the root beer lover is holed up in the third house. That's our starting point. And the fella who likes red is also in the third house.  Now, the coffee drinker is somewhere to the right of the green-lover, and there are two houses between the white-lover and the coffee drinker.  

Putting it all together, the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house.  

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got two targets, each with their own unique trail.

Think of it like this:

* House 1 is like a fresh set of tracks, the fantasy book enthusiast is our first clue.
* House 2 is where the trail gets a bit muddled, but we know the pizza eater was there.

Now, the green lover is always close to the radio, like a predator stalking its prey. That means green is in House 1, and the radio's in House 2.

Finally, the fish enthusiast isn't in House 1, so they must be in House 2.

Putting it all together, the cat lover must be in House 1.

**(A) 1** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the trail, piece by piece.  

Think of each clue as a footprint. Some are clear, some are fainter, but they all lead to the same target: figuring out who lives where and what they like.

Start by laying out your traps - I mean, your categories: house number, pet, book, lunch, color, and drink. Then, use those clues to fill in the blanks.

Remember, sometimes you gotta circle back and look at the tracks from a different angle.  

Now, go get 'em!

The answer is **(E) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this is a tracking problem, plain and simple. We've got four targets, each with their own trail.  Clue number eight tells us straight up: the kiwi eater is in house number one.  That's your first mark. 

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the scent, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We're looking for the one where the stew's been cooked.

Now, these clues are our tracks:

* **Clue 1:** Rose bouquet leads directly to grilled cheese.
* **Clue 2:** Oranges are somewhere before apples.
* **Clue 3:** Tulips aren't in the last house.
* **Clue 4:** Grilled cheese and stew are side-by-side.
* **Clue 5:** Daffodils aren't in the last house either.
* **Clue 6:** Pizza's to the left of grilled cheese.
* **Clue 7:** Grilled cheese is to the right of spaghetti.
* **Clue 8:** Tulips are right next to grilled cheese.
* **Clue 9:** Two houses separate oranges and kiwis.
* **Clue 10:** Oranges are after carnations.
* **Clue 11:** Apples are before mangos.

Follow these tracks carefully, and you'll find your stew.

The answer is **(D) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We gotta think like a predator, see?

These clues are like scent trails.  We gotta follow 'em carefully.

First, that cat lover, he's our starting point. He's holed up in house number one.

Now, the tulips are right next to the dog.  That narrows things down.

And remember, the horse and the carnations, they're separated by one house.

Finally, the lilies are somewhere to the right of the horse.

Put it all together, and you'll find the fish enthusiast is in house number four.

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We know the phone's in the first house.  The fella with the boots ain't in the second house, so he's gotta be in the first.  Now, whoever's got the horses and the radio are right next to each other.  Since the phone's already in the first house, the horses and the radio gotta be split between the two. That means the high heels are in the second house.

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target. We gotta follow the trail carefully.

After piecing together all the clues, I'd say the person who likes green is holed up in **house 3 (C)**. 



"
"Listen up, rookie. Tracking down a target takes keen observation and deduction.  

Think of these houses like a hunting ground. We need to figure out where our quarry, the bird keeper, is hiding.

We know the basketball player ain't in the first house, but he's somewhere before the swimmer. That puts the basketball player in house three, and the swimmer in the last house.

The baseball player's easy to spot - he's in house two. Now, the tennis player's gotta be next to the cat lover.  

The bird keeper can't be in the first or third house, leaving only one spot for him - the last house.

So, the bird keeper's holed up in house **(C) 4**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three colors, three cars, three instruments, three devices, and three sports.  

Think of it like setting traps. Each clue is a trap, narrowing down the possibilities. We gotta use 'em strategically.

* **Clue 1:** White's to the right of the computer. That means the computer ain't in the last house.
* **Clue 3:** Sedan's right next to the SUV. They're like a pair of hunting dogs, always together.
* **Clue 6:** Sedan and Gameboy are also side-by-side.

Now, we're starting to see a pattern.

* **Clue 2:** Baseball player's one house away from the blue lover.

We gotta keep our eyes peeled for that connection.

* **Clue 5:** Violinist ain't in the first house.

That eliminates one spot.

* **Clue 7:** Guitarist's to the right of the white lover.

Think of it like following tracks. Each clue leads us closer to our target.

Keep working through those clues, and you'll flush out the soccer player's location.  

Now, which house is it?

**(B) 3** 



"
"Listen up, rookie.  You gotta be sharp as a tack to track your prey.  In this case, the trail leads straight to the first house. That's where you'll find the one who had the grilled cheese.  

**(E) 1** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target. We gotta follow 'em carefully.

* The pianist ain't in the first house. That narrows things down right away.
* Oranges are to the right of kiwis, and kiwis are to the left of boots. That's a good trail to follow.
* High heels and the piano player are side-by-side, just like a pair of hunting dogs.
* Running shoes and the percussionist are also a team, sticking together.

Now, the radio's gotta be left of the high heels, and the oranges are just left of the television.

Putting it all together, the television's gotta be in house number **(A) 3**.  We've cornered our target! 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, until you corner your target.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot.  We need to figure out which one holds the sedan.  

Now, I ain't gonna lie, this takes some careful observation. You gotta look for patterns, connections, and contradictions in those clues. It's like reading the tracks in the woods - each detail matters.

After studying the trail, I'd say the sedan is parked in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  We've got three houses, three folks, and some clues about their rides and snacks.

Think of it like tracking prey: we need to follow the signs.

* We know the kiwi-eater's holed up in house number one.
* The truck ain't parked at house three, and neither is the SUV.
*  The truck driver also steers clear of house one.

That means the truck's gotta be at house two.  And since the SUV ain't at the ends, it's gotta be at house two as well.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We know the fried rice eater's holed up in the third house.  The spaghetti slurper's right next door, in the second house.  The swimmer's already made a splash in the first.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  We gotta use our instincts and follow the trail of clues.

See, these folks are like animals in their habitats. We gotta figure out where each one belongs.

The truck's gotta be near the sandals, like a predator stalkin' its prey. And the loafers are somewhere to the left of that truck, maybe hidin' in the brush. Boots are even further left, maybe scoutin' ahead.

Now, the white-lovin' fella's in the fourth house, that's a solid marker. And the blue-lovin' one's way out in the fifth, probably got a view of the whole territory.

Thinkin' about it, the boots gotta be in house **(A) 2**. It's the only spot that makes sense with all the clues. 



"
"Listen up, this is a simple tracking problem.  The history buff is your target. Clue number two tells you plain as day: they're holed up in house number one.  

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail, and use every clue to your advantage.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot. We need to figure out which one holds the apple eater.

Now, I ain't gonna lie, this takes some time. You gotta sift through the clues, see which ones overlap, and eliminate the wrong paths. It's like setting traps, you gotta make sure you're not wasting your time on the wrong ones.

But trust me, with patience and a keen eye, you'll flush out the answer.

Now, go on, get to work!  

**(D) 2** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target. We gotta follow 'em carefully.

* The history buff's in the middle house, that's our starting point.
* The fella with the loafers is in the last house.
* And the daffodils are in the middle house too.

Now, the yellow-lover ain't in the first or last house, so they gotta be in the middle.

The clue about the boots and the yellow-lover being side-by-side tells us the boots are in the first house.

Since the blue-lover is to the right of the high heels, and the loafers are in the last house, the high heels gotta be in the first house too.

That leaves the green-lover in the first house.

**So the answer is (A) 1.** 



"
"Listen up, this is a tracking problem, plain and simple. We've got five targets, each with their own unique sign: footwear and a vehicle.  

The first clue tells us the one wearing running shoes is holed up in the first house. That's our starting point.  

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  

We know the cricketer's holed up in the first house. That narrows things down right away. Now, the truck driver's always gonna be trailing the basketball player, see? Can't have the truck driver leading the way.  

That means the basketball player's gotta be in the second house.  

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground, and the items as the tracks you're following.  

Now, I can't just give you the answer, that'd be like handing you a deer on a silver platter. But I can tell you this: pay close attention to the clues that link things together. For example, if you know the saxophonist is in one house, and the tulips are to the right, you can eliminate some houses right off the bat.

Keep your eyes peeled for those connections, and you'll track down the house with the tulips in no time.

Now get out there and hunt!

**(C) 5** 



"
"Alright, partner, let's track down this sedan owner.  Think of this like tracking prey - we gotta use the clues to narrow down the possibilities.

These folks are spread out like deer in a field, each with their own unique markings: shoes, cars, meals, and drinks. We need to use those clues to corner our target.

* **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the fried rice eater are side-by-side. They're a pair, sticking close.
* **Clue 3:** The high heels ain't in the last house. That narrows things down.
* **Clue 4:** Milk drinker's in the third house. That's a solid landmark.
* **Clue 5:** Root beer lover's to the left of the SUV owner.  They're moving in a line.
* **Clue 6:** Two houses between the sedan and the water drinker.  They're keeping their distance.
* **Clue 7:** Running shoes are in the second house. That's a clear footprint.
* **Clue 8:** Convertible's left of the water drinker.  They're traveling together.
* **Clue 9:** Spaghetti eater ain't in the first house. They're not leading the pack.

Now, we gotta use our instincts and experience to piece together the rest.  Think like a predator, anticipate their movements, and you'll find your target.

After carefully considering all the clues, the sedan owner is in house **(A) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox.  We need to find the cellist's hideout.

Think of it like this: each house is a different territory, and each clue is a footprint leading us closer to our target.

By carefully analyzing the clues, we can piece together the layout and pinpoint the cellist's location.

After studying the tracks, I'd say the cellist is holed up in **house 3 (C)**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Think of it like this: each house is a different stand, and we're tryin' to figure out which one holds the fella with the truck.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll give you a hint: pay close attention to who's next to who.  Those relationships are key.

After you've laid out all the clues, you'll see the truck driver's stand clear as day.

My bet's on **(D) 2**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target - the coffee drinker.

* The tea drinker's in the first house, that's our starting point.
* Apples are to the left of the minivan, so the minivan's gotta be in the last house.
* The convertible's to the right of the sci-fi fan, meaning the sci-fi fan's not in the last house.
* The fantasy reader and the coffee drinker are separated by one house.
* And finally, the orange eater isn't in the middle house.

Now, piecing it all together, we can deduce the coffee drinker's in the **second house (B)**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got three houses, three folks, and some clues to sniff out.

Think of it like this: we're tracking three different animals. One's got a red mark, one's got a yellow mark, and one's got a white mark.  We also know they each have a favorite hunting ground - fantasy, romance, or mystery.

Here's what we know:

* The red-marked one is right next to the mystery lover.
* The fantasy hunter isn't in the first house.
* The white-marked one isn't in the last house.
* The red-marked one is in the second house.

Now, if the red-marked one is in the second house, and they're next to the mystery lover, that means the mystery lover is in the third house.  That leaves the first house for the fantasy hunter.

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this is a tracking problem, plain and simple. We've got four targets, each with their own trail.  Clue number five is our smoking gun: it tells us the SUV is parked in the third house.  

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Think of each house as a different hunting blind, and each characteristic as a sign you're lookin' for.  The key is to figure out which sign belongs in which blind.

Now, without givin' away the whole hunt, I'll tell ya this: the root beer lover is holed up in **(A) 3**.  Trust me on this one. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We need to find the science fiction reader's lair.

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target. We gotta follow the trail carefully.

* The fantasy reader is holed up in house number three. That's our starting point.
* The history buff is right next door, in house number two.
* The sci-fi fan is somewhere to the right of the fantasy reader, meaning they're in house number four.

There you have it. The science fiction book fanatic is in **(B) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey. We got two targets, two houses. One's got spaghetti breath, the other's got that fried rice smell. One's tootin' on a flute, the other's got a cello. One's struttin' in loafers, the other's got sandals. One's got a taste for white, the other's green. One's cruisin' in a sedan, the other's got a big ol' SUV.

Now, the fried rice ain't in the first house. And the SUV ain't in the second. The flute player's right next to the white-lovin' one, and the loafer-wearer's right next to the white-lovin' one too.

Puttin' it all together, the sandals are in **House 2 (B)**.  That's where we find our target. 



"
"Alright, partner, let's track down this violinist.  Think of this like stalking prey - we gotta use the clues to narrow down their location.

These folks are spread out like deer in a field, each with their own unique markings: flowers, fruit, vehicles, instruments, and drinks.

We know the root beer lover is holed up in the third house, and the water drinker is right next to the minivan owner.  The sedan is prowling somewhere to the left of the mango eater, and it's also right next to the daffodils.

The cellist is just left of the saxophonist, and the apples are left of the violinist.

Now, picture this: the sedan is leading the pack, followed by the daffodils, then the apples, and finally the violinist.

That means the violinist is in **house (A) 2**. 




"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, use every clue, and piece together the trail.  

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out where the fella wearing loafers is holed up.

Now, I ain't gonna lie, this takes some time. You gotta sift through the clues, see which ones overlap, and eliminate the wrong paths. It's like following tracks - sometimes they lead nowhere, but sometimes they point you right to your quarry.

After carefully studying the signs, I'd say the fella in loafers is in **(B) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down. We know one fella's got a TV, the other's got a computer.  And one's got lilies, the other's got roses.  

The key is, the lilies ain't in the first house. That means the computer's gotta be in the second house.  

**(A) 2** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We gotta think like a predator, use the clues to corner our prey.

The science fiction reader's gotta be left of the golfer, right? That means they can't be in the second house.  The pizza eater and the history buff are side-by-side, like a pack of wolves. And the guitarist, they're always hanging out where the flowers are pretty, so they gotta be to the right of the daffodils.

Now, think about it. If the daffodils are in the first house, the guitarist's gotta be in the second. That means the percussionist is in the first house.

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Think of it like this: each house is a different stand, and we're tryin' to figure out who's holed up where.  

* We know the violinist's in the fourth stand, and the bird keeper's in the fifth. That's a good start.
* Now, the gameboy's gotta be to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist's gotta be to the right of the percussionist. That narrows things down.
* The TV's next to the gameboy, and the flutist's next to the TV.  We're gettin' a clearer picture.
* The fish enthusiast and the horse owner are side-by-side, and there's a couple of stands between the phone and the horses.

Puttin' it all together, you'll find the percussionist is holed up in **house number 2**.

 **(B)** 




"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We know the lilies are in the first house, that's our starting point. Now, the basketball player ain't in the first house, so he's gotta be in the second.  

Think about it: the radio's gotta be to the right of both the apples and the violinist. That means the violinist's gotta be in the first house, and the radio's in the second.

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We gotta be methodical, see?

Five houses, five targets. Each one's got a sport and a meal. We know the tennis player's holed up in house number three, and the grilled cheese eater's in house five. The golfer's in house four.

Now, the fried rice and spaghetti folks gotta be separated by one house.  And the pizza eater's gotta be somewhere before the cricketer.  Stew's right next to spaghetti, and the tennis player's to the left of the soccer player.

Think it through, and you'll find your target. The cricketer's in **(B) 2**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got two targets, two houses.  

Think of it like this: we're looking for tracks, clues left behind.

* One fella's got stew in his belly, the other spaghetti. One's a white-lovin' type, the other bleeds red. One's a water drinker, the other's got a taste for milk. One swings a bat, the other's all about the water. And one's got on running shoes, the other's got loafers.

Now, here's what we know for sure:

* The runner ain't in the first house.
* The white-lovin' fella's right next to the spaghetti eater.
* The baseball player and the spaghetti eater are neighbors.
* The water drinker and the spaghetti eater are neighbors too.

Puttin' it all together, the runner's gotta be in the second house, right next to the spaghetti eater. That means the loafer-wearin' fella's gotta be in the first house.

**So the answer is (B).** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got three houses, three folks, and some clues about their tastes.  

Think of it like tracking prey - we need to follow the signs.

The coffee drinker's gotta be somewhere before the mango muncher. And the water drinker? They're trailing behind the root beer fan.

Now, the root beer lover ain't in the middle house, and neither is the orange eater. That means the mango eater's gotta be in the middle.

That leaves the coffee drinker in the first house and the root beer lover in the last.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three meals, and three types of footwear.  

Think of it like this: the spaghetti eater is our starting point, a clear trail. They're in House 1. Now, the fried rice eater can't be in the middle house, and the boots wearer is right next to them. That puts the fried rice in House 3 and the boots in House 2.

That leaves the loafers wearer. They can't be in House 1, so they must be in House 2.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot. Each clue is like a footprint, a sign, leading you closer to your target - the mystery book reader.

You gotta use those clues to eliminate possibilities, narrow down the search area.  It's like stalking through the woods, knowing your quarry is somewhere in that thicket.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but trust me, with a keen eye and a sharp mind, you'll flush out that mystery reader.

Keep your wits about you, and remember, patience is key.

The answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta be methodical, use every clue, and piece together the trail.

Think of each house like a different hunting blind, and the clues are your tracks. You gotta follow 'em carefully to find your quarry - the lilies.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll tell ya this: pay close attention to the clues about the dog owner and the tulips. They'll lead you right to the lilies.

After you've mapped out the whole territory, you'll see the answer clear as day.

My bet's on **(E) 4**. 



"
"Listen closely, this is how we track our quarry. We know the mystery reader is holed up in house number one.  The tennis player, they're always on the move, wouldn't be caught dead in that first house. That leaves the fantasy enthusiast to roam free in house number two. 

(B) 2 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail of clues, and piece together the whole picture.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We're looking for the one where the fella who likes white is holed up.

Now, these clues are our tracks. We gotta follow 'em carefully:

*  The guy with the sandals is right next to the spaghetti eater.
*  The stew eater is somewhere before the spaghetti guy.
*  The roses aren't in the first house.
*  Running shoes are right next to the daffodils.
*  Pizza and daffodils are neighbors.
*  White is somewhere to the right of the running shoes.
*  Lilies are right next to the guitarist.
*  Daffodils aren't in the third house.
*  There are two houses between the green lover and the pianist.
*  Green is to the left of the pianist.
*  Blue is to the left of the pizza eater.
*  Lilies are to the right of the violinist.
*  Loafers are in the last house.

Now, you gotta use your instincts.  Connect the dots, eliminate the wrong trails, and you'll find your target.

The white-loving fella is in house **(A) 3**. 




"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, just like following tracks in the woods.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. You've got your scents - the colors, the shoes, the drinks, the instruments, and the sports. Each clue is like a footprint, leading you closer to your target: the water drinker.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll tell you this: pay close attention to who's next to who.  Sometimes the most important clues are the ones that tell you what's *not* there.

Keep your eyes sharp and your mind focused, and you'll bag your quarry.

The answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this is a tracking problem, plain and simple. We've got three targets, three houses.  Clue number one tells us the red-lover is holed up in house number one.  That's our starting point.  

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, until you corner your target.  

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out where the lilies are hidden.  

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll give you a tip: pay close attention to the clues about the order of things.  Who's next to who? What's on either side? That's how you'll flush out the answer.

Keep your eyes sharp and your mind focused, and you'll bag your prize.

The answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Listen closely, because this is how a seasoned tracker figures things out. We've got two targets, two houses. One's got kiwis, the other's got apples. One's got a bird, the other's got a dog. One's a tennis player, the other's a cricketer. One's reading mysteries, the other's lost in science fiction. And one's wearing sandals, the other's got high heels.

Now, the kiwi eater's in the first house. That's our starting point. The bird and the high heels are side-by-side, so they're in the second house. The tennis player and the apple eater are also neighbors, meaning they're in the second house too.  The dog owner can't be in the first house, so they must be in the second.

That leaves the cricketer. By process of elimination, they've gotta be in the first house.

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the scent, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a territory, and the details about the folks inside as tracks.  

* You got your food scraps - stew, pizza, fried rice, grilled cheese, spaghetti.
* You got your animal signs - fish, horses, birds, cats, dogs.
* You got your sport trails - basketball, cricket, swimming, golf, tennis.
* And don't forget the fruit droppings - grapes, mangos, kiwis, apples, oranges.

Now, start connecting the dots.  One clue leads to another.  For example, the oranges are in the second house, and the swimmer is also in the second house. That means the swimmer is eating oranges.

Keep at it, and you'll track down the grape eater.

The answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Picture four cabins in a row, each with a different hunter livin' in it. Each one's got their own gear, their own grub, and their own favorite color.

Now, the clues are like scent markers, leadin' you to the right answer. You gotta sniff 'em out carefully.

After piecin' together the clues, I'd say the fella who had pizza is holed up in **(D) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We know the baseball player and the convertible driver are the same fella, holed up in the second house.  The grape-muncher ain't in the first house, so he's gotta be with the baseball player. That leaves the mango eater in the first house.

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  We've got three targets, each with their own trail. One's got apples, one's got kiwis, and one's got oranges.  And each one's got a color preference - blue, white, or green.

Now, the blue one's holed up in the middle house, that's our starting point.  We also know the kiwi eater's further down the line, past the blue one.  And the white one's always trailing the green one.

Finally, the apple eater's right next to the orange eater, no space between 'em.

Putting it all together, the white one's gotta be in the last house.

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry.  We know the rose bouquet is a key clue.  The root beer drinker is always trailing behind, see?  That means the roses gotta be in the first house.  

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  Think of those houses like a hunting blind setup. You gotta be strategic.

We know the truck's parked next to the sedan, see? And the fishin' fella's gotta be somewhere before the dog owner.  That minivan's gotta be on the far right, like a lookout point.

Now, the cat lover ain't in the second spot.  Puttin' it all together, the dog owner's gotta be in house number three.  That's where you'll find your target.

**(C)** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  

Think of it like stalking prey. We need to use the clues to corner our target, the blue-loving resident.

* We know the root beer drinker is holed up in the second house. That's our starting point.
* The yellow-lover is in the third house.  

Now, the blue-lover is always to the right of the yellow-lover. That means they gotta be in the fourth house.

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical.  

Think of it like this: each house is a territory, and each clue is a sign left behind. You gotta follow those signs to find your target - the bird keeper.

Trust me, I've got a nose for these things. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail of clues, and piece together the whole picture.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out who's where, what they're eating, and what they're into.  

Now, the tennis player... they're sneaky, always moving around. But we can corner them.  Look for clues that put them near other folks, like the bird keeper.  They're often found together, those two.

Keep your eyes peeled for connections, and you'll flush out the tennis player's location.

The answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, see the connections, and follow the trail.  

Think of each clue as a footprint.  Some are clear, some are fainter, but they all lead to the same target: figuring out who's who and where they live.

You gotta lay out all the information, like setting traps in a pattern.  Then, you start connecting the dots.  One clue might tell you who's next to whom, another might tell you what they like.

Keep going, piece by piece, and you'll corner your target - the history buff.

Now, without giving away the whole hunt, I'll tell you this: the history buff is holed up in **(A) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We know the cellist is right next to the fella with the gameboy. That means they're in houses side-by-side. Now, the dog owner ain't in the first house.  That leaves only one place for the hound: the second house.

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got four houses, each with a different resident and their set of wheels and gadgets.  

Think of it like scouting a territory. We need to use the clues to pinpoint the SUV's location.

* The gameboy's in the third house, that's our landmark.
* The minivan's parked in the first house, good to know.
* Now, the phone's gotta be next to the SUV, like a scout flanking its leader.
* The radio's somewhere to the right of the gameboy, so it's in the last house.
* The convertible ain't in the third house, and the computer ain't in the first.

Putting it all together, the SUV's gotta be in the second house.

**Answer: (D)** 



"
"Alright, let's track down this carnations arrangement.  Think of it like stalking prey - we need to use the clues to narrow down its location.

We know the tulips are in the third house, that's our starting point. The computer's in the second house, and the phone's gotta be next to the TV.  

Now, the lilies are always to the right of the phone, and the daffodils are to the right of the radio.  

Putting it all together, the carnations have to be in the fifth house.

"Alright, let's track this down like a wily buck. We've got two cabins, two folks, and a whole lot of clues.

Think of it like this: we're lookin' for the scent trail of that pizza.

* We know the radio and truck are side-by-side, like a pair of hunting dogs.
* And the grapes are right next to the computer, like a deer and its fawn.
* The radio's gotta be left of the pizza, like a good tracker follows the wind.
* And the root beer drinker ain't in the first cabin.

Puttin' it all together, the pizza's gotta be in the second cabin.

"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We gotta be methodical, see?

Think of these houses like a hunting ground. We know the tea drinker's holed up in the first one. The pizza eater's right next door, see? Now, the milk drinker's gotta be somewhere to the left of the spaghetti slurper, and those two are followed by the water drinker and the white lover, side by side.

The coffee drinker's somewhere before the yellow lover, and we know green ain't in the first house.

Now, the red-lover is tricky.  They're one house away from the SUV, but the SUV is to the right of the loafers.  

Put it all together, and you'll find the red-lover is in house number **2**. 

(C) 2 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, until you corner your target.  

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. Each clue is a footprint, a scent, a sign that tells you where to look next.  

Now, I can't just give you the answer, that'd be like shooting a fish in a barrel. But I will say this: pay close attention to the clues that link things together.  

For example, knowing who lives next to who is like finding two sets of tracks crossing. It narrows down your search area.

Keep your eyes peeled for those connections, and you'll flush out the answer.

The house with the lilies? It's **(D) 2**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target - the grilled cheese eater.

* We know the soccer player's holed up in the third house. That's our starting point.
* Now, the tulips aren't in the third house, so they gotta be in either the first or second.
*  The lilies are always next to the grilled cheese, so the grilled cheese can't be in the first house.

That means the grilled cheese is in the **second house**.  

(B) 2 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  We gotta use our instincts and follow the trail of clues.

The key here is to find the one solid piece of ground to start from.  That spaghetti eater in the fourth house, that's our starting point. Now, we gotta see where the other tracks lead us.

Water drinker's always thirsty, gotta be following the grilled cheese eater.  And remember, the running shoes? They're somewhere before the stew.

* The radio's in the third house, that's our starting point.

* Now, the cricketer and the loafer-wearer are also in the third house.

That leaves us with the computer, the gameboy, the grilled cheese, and a few other clues to sort out.

Remember, the root beer drinker's gotta be left of the radio, and the milk drinker's left of the high heels.

Think about it like stalking through the woods, piecing together the signs.  The stew eater's gotta be left of the fried rice, and the spaghetti eater's even further left.

Keep your eyes peeled for those connections, and you'll find your target - the computer's house.

The answer is **(C) 3**.

"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox.  We gotta use our instincts and the clues to figure out where this computer is hiding.

"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

First, picture four cabins in a line. Now, each one's got a fella inside with somethin' different: a gadget, a musical thingamajig, a fruit, some fancy footwear, and a favorite book.

We gotta figure out where the fella eatin' oranges is holed up.

Here's what I've gathered:

* The grape-eatin' fella and the orange-eatin' fella are right next to each other.
* The fella with the phone's in the third cabin.
* The saxophonist's somewhere to the left of the fella wearin' boots.
* The fella with the flute's in the third cabin.
* The orange-eatin' fella's somewhere to the right of the fella wearin' boots.
* The fella wearin' runnin' shoes is in the third cabin.
* The romance book lover's right next to the science fiction fella.
* The fella wearin' loafers ain't in the first cabin.
* The fella with the gameboy's somewhere to the right of the flute player.
* There's two cabins between the fella wearin' high heels and the fella who likes fantasy books.
* The history book buff's somewhere to the left of the orange-eatin' fella.
* The fella with the radio ain't in the second cabin.
* The fella eatin' kiwis ain't in the first cabin.
* The percussionist's in the fourth cabin.

"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail of clues, and piece together the whole picture.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out who's where based on what they like.

Now, the key here is to look for connections.  Some clues link things directly, like the root beer drinker and the milk drinker being neighbors. Others give you a direction, like the pizza eater being left of the tea drinker.

Use those connections to narrow down the possibilities. It's like setting traps – each clue eliminates a spot where someone *can't* be.

Keep going, step by step, and you'll corner your target – the apple eater.

The answer is **(C) 4**.

* The mystery reader's in house four, that's our starting point. And right next door, in house four, is the saxophonist.

* Now, the percussionist is right next to the romance reader, so they must be in house three.

* We know the history buff is one house away from the guitarist, and since the mystery reader is in house four, the history buff must be in house two and the guitarist in house five.

* The romance reader is to the left of the fantasy reader, meaning the fantasy reader is in house five.

* Finally, the saxophonist and violinist are side-by-side, so the violinist must be in house three.

Got it? The violinist is in house three. 


**(C)**
"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got four houses, each with a different resident and their gear.  

Think of it like setting up a trap. We need to figure out the pattern, the clues are our bait.

* The TV's in the last house, that's our starting point.
* Loafers are in the second house, good to know.
* Phone's not in the second house, so it's gotta be somewhere else.
* Boots are somewhere before the loafers, so that puts them in the first house.
* Now, the radio and sandals are two houses apart.  

Putting it all together, the Gameboy's gotta be in the third house. 

So the answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is a simple tracking problem.  The high-heel wearer is easy to spot. They're in house number **(B) 2**.  You gotta pay attention to the signs, just like in the woods. 



"
"Listen up, this is a simple tracking problem. We know two folks live in these houses, each with their own quirks. One's got their nose stuck in history books, the other's a fan of a good mystery.  And their footwear? One's sporting loafers, the other's got on high heels.

Now, we're told the loafer wearer ain't in the first house. That means they gotta be in the second.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got four houses, each with a different resident and their quirks. Think of it like four different hunting blinds, each with its own scent.

We need to figure out where the pizza-eater is holed up.  

*  The clues are our tracks, leading us to the right spot.

*  We know the running shoes and the gameboy are side-by-side, like a hunter and their trusty hound.

*  Pizza's right next to the sandals, like a campfire and a sleeping bag.

*  Running shoes are left of the stew, like a hunter setting up camp before nightfall.

*  And so on...

Follow those tracks carefully, and you'll find the pizza-eater is in **house number 3**. 

(B) 3 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We know the mango-muncher is holed up in the first house. The lily-lover is further down the line, see? And the saxophonist, he's not in the first house, he's gotta be in the second. That leaves the apple eater in the second house, plain as day.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta follow the trails, see?

The coffee drinker, that's our target.  We know they're holed up in house number **4**.  

That's where you'll find 'em.  Trust me, I've got a nose for these things. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  We gotta track down this truck driver.  

Think of it like this: we're stalkin' our prey through three houses. Each one's got a different scent - tulips, roses, and lilies. And each fella's got his own ride - a sedan, an SUV, and a truck.

Now, here's what we know:

* The tulip house ain't the last one.
* The SUV's parked right next to the lilies.
* The sedan and roses are side-by-side, but the roses ain't in the middle house.

Puttin' it all together, the truck's gotta be in the last house.  

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Alright, partner, let's track down this milk-lovin' fella.  

Think of this like tracking prey. We gotta use the clues as our scent trail. Each clue narrows down the possibilities, just like following footprints.

We gotta be methodical, checkin' each house, eliminatin' suspects until we corner our target.  

After carefully examinin' the trail, I'd say the milk drinker is holed up in **(B) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail of clues, and you'll bag your answer.

Think of each house as a hunting blind, and the people inside are your quarry.  We need to figure out where the basketball player is hiding.

Now, these clues are like scent trails. You gotta sniff 'em out and see where they lead:

*  The yellow-lover is in the first blind.
* The kiwi-eater is also in the first blind.
* The convertible is parked in the fourth blind.

That's our starting point. Now, use the rest of the clues to narrow down the rest. Remember, every clue connects to another. It's a chain reaction.

Once you've mapped out all the connections, you'll know exactly which blind the basketball player is in.

Good luck, hunter.  

**(A) 4** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.

Think of it like this: each house is a hunting blind, and we need to figure out who's holed up where.

* We know the green-loving fella is in the last blind, house number three. That's our starting point.
* Now, the yellow enthusiast is right next to him, so they're in house number two.
* The stew-eater is to the left of the romance reader, meaning stew's in the first house and the romance reader's in the second.
* The fantasy buff is somewhere to the right of the stew-eater, so they must be in the last house.

That leaves the blue lover.  Since the other colors are taken, they gotta be in the first house.

So, the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox.  We need to find the bird keeper's hideout.

Think of it like this: each house is a different territory, and we need to figure out which one the bird keeper calls home. We've got clues scattered around like tracks in the woods.

By carefully piecing together the information about flowers, instruments, cars, pets, and colors, we can narrow down the possibilities.

After carefully analyzing the situation, I'd say the bird keeper is holed up in **house 2 (B)**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry. We know the cellist and the fantasy reader are holed up together in the first house.  That leaves the mystery reader and the pianist in the second house.  

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be patient, observe the signs, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot.  We need to figure out who's where based on what they're eating, reading, wearing, and doing.

Now, I can't just give you the answer, that's no fun. But I can tell you this: pay close attention to the clues about who's next to whom. Those are your best leads.

For example, knowing the mangos are right next to the oranges is like finding two sets of tracks crossing. It narrows down the search area.

Keep your eyes peeled for those connections, and you'll flush out the swimmer's location.

Now get to it!

**(C) 4** 



"
"Listen closely, this is how we track our prey.  We know the golfer's in the middle house, the history buff's in the first, and there's a house between the swimmer and the science fiction fan. That means the swimmer's gotta be in the last house. 

**(C) 3** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues carefully, see?

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out where the stew-eater is hiding.

Now, these clues are like tracks. We gotta follow 'em one by one:

*  Some tracks lead us to specific spots, like knowing the bird keeper's in the third house. That's a good starting point.
* Other tracks tell us about relationships, like the swimmer being left of the apple-eater. That narrows things down.

You gotta keep piecing together these tracks, see?  Eventually, you'll corner your prey - the stew-eater.

After carefully studying the tracks, I'd say the stew-eater is in **(A) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. This is how we track this down.

We got two cabins, see? One fella's got sandals, the other's got horses.  Now, the history buff, he's gotta be on the same side as the spaghetti eater, but further down the line.

That means we got two ways this could play out. But only one makes sense.

Think about it: you can't have all the good stuff - fried rice, romance novels, and fancy runnin' shoes - all crammed into one cabin. Gotta spread the wealth, right?

So, we can't say for sure which cabin's got the fried rice. Could be either one. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry.  We know the lilies are gonna be where the sedan ain't.  And the flutist, they're not in the first house. That means the lilies gotta be in the second house. 

(B) 2 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues carefully, just like I track a deer through the woods.

Think of it like this: each house is a different territory, and we need to figure out who's where.

* The mystery reader is like a lone wolf, always one step ahead. He's gotta be in house number one, see? That puts the swimmer right next door in house two.

* The fantasy book lover, he's like a sly fox, always lurking nearby. He's gotta be in house one too, right next to the mystery reader.

* Now, the rose bouquet, that's like a bright signal flare. It's in house three.

* And the daffodils, they're like a trail of breadcrumbs leading to house two.

*  The carnations, they're in the last house, number four.

*  That leaves the romance book lover in house four.

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail, and piece together the clues.  

Think of each house as a different hunting ground, and the details about the folks inside as tracks and signs.  You gotta use those clues to figure out where the tulips are hidden.

After carefully studying the terrain, I'd say the vase of tulips is in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target. We gotta follow 'em carefully.

* **Clue 7** tells us the minivan's parked in the third house. That's our starting point.
* **Clue 8** says the golfer's in the first house.

Now, picture this:

House 1: Golfer
House 2: ?
House 3: Minivan

* **Clue 1** says the boots are right next to the minivan. So, the boots are in house 2.

House 1: Golfer
House 2: Boots
House 3: Minivan

* **Clue 4** tells us the cricketer's just left of the tulips. That means the cricketer's in house 2 and the tulips are in house 3.

House 1: Golfer
House 2: Boots, Cricketer
House 3: Minivan, Tulips

* **Clue 9** says the rose bouquet ain't in house 2. So, it's gotta be in house 1.

House 1: Golfer, Rose Bouquet
House 2: Boots, Cricketer
House 3: Minivan, Tulips

* **Clue 3** says the running shoes ain't in house 1. That means they're in house 3.

House 1: Golfer, Rose Bouquet
House 2: Boots, Cricketer
House 3: Minivan, Tulips, Running Shoes

* **Clue 2** says the pizza eater's to the right of the rose bouquet. That puts the pizza eater in house 3.

House 1: Golfer, Rose Bouquet
House 2: Boots, Cricketer
House 3: Minivan, Tulips, Running Shoes, Pizza

* **Clue 6** says the grilled cheese eater's to the right of the sedan. Since the minivan's in house 3, the sedan's in house 1, and the grilled cheese is in house 2.

House 1: Golfer, Rose Bouquet, Sedan
House 2: Boots, Cricketer, Grilled Cheese
House 3: Minivan, Tulips, Running Shoes, Pizza

* That leaves tennis for house 1.

House 1: Golfer, Rose Bouquet, Sedan, Tennis Player
House 2: Boots, Cricketer, Grilled Cheese
House 3: Minivan, Tulips, Running Shoes, Pizza

* The convertible's gotta be in house 2.

House 1: Golfer, Rose Bouquet, Sedan, Tennis Player
House 2: Boots, Cricketer, Grilled Cheese, Convertible
House 3: Minivan, Tulips, Running Shoes, Pizza

* And finally, the carnations are in house 2.

House 1: Golfer, Rose Bouquet, Sedan, Tennis Player
House 2: Boots, Cricketer, Grilled Cheese, Convertible, Carnations
House 3: Minivan, Tulips, Running Shoes, Pizza



So, the rose bouquet is in **house 1 (A)**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, until you corner your target.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot.  The clues are like tracks and signs. You gotta use 'em to figure out who's where.

Now, without giving away the whole hunt, I'll tell you this: the percussionist is a tricky one to find. They're sneaky, like a fox. But if you follow the trail carefully, you'll find 'em.

The answer is **(C) 4**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got five houses, five folks, and a whole lot of clues.  Think of it like setting traps - each clue narrows down our target.

We know the fried rice eater is in house number three. That's our starting point. Now, the stew and green-lover can't be in house two.  And the stew ain't in house four either.  

The red-lover is right next to the stew eater, so they must be in house four and the stew eater in house five.

The blue-lover is somewhere before the spaghetti eater, and the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the white-lover.  And remember, there's one house between the white and yellow lovers.

Using these tracks, we can piece together the whole picture.

The white-lover is in house **(A) 1**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like this: we're stalking our prey, and each clue is a footprint. We gotta follow 'em carefully to find our target.

The basketball player's gotta be to the right of the tennis player, but the violinist's gotta be to the right of the basketball player. That narrows things down. And we know the red-lovin' fella's in the last house.

Putting it all together, the basketball player's gotta be in house number **2**. 

That's where we'll find our target. 



"
"Alright, partner, let's track down this carnations arrangement.  Think of it like stalking prey - we gotta be methodical and use every clue to our advantage.

These houses are our territory, and we need to map it out. Each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target.  

After carefully studying the trail, I'd say the carnations are in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail, and use every clue to corner your target.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot.  Those clues are like tracks and scat - they tell you who's where and what they're about.  

Now, I ain't gonna do all the work for ya, but I'll give you this:  Focus on the clues that link things directly.  Like, if one clue says the sax player lives next to the sci-fi nut, that's a good place to start.  Then, see what other clues connect to those two.

Keep your eyes peeled for patterns and contradictions.  Just like in the woods, sometimes the absence of a track tells you as much as the presence of one.

Now get out there and bag your quarry!

The minivan's in house **(D) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the scent, and piece together the clues.

Think of it like this: each house is a territory, and each clue is a footprint. We need to map out who's where based on what we know.

The key is to start with the sure things, the tracks that are clear as day. Then, use those to figure out the rest.

After carefully studying the terrain, I've pinpointed the location of the tulips.

The answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We gotta be sharp, see the connections.

The basketball player's in the first house, right? And he's also the saxophonist. That means house number one's taken. Now, the cricketer's gotta be next door, 'cause the tea drinker's right beside him.  That puts the cricketer in house number two.

Think about it: the pizza eater's right next to the dog owner. Since the first house is full, the pizza eater's there, and the dog owner's in house number two.

Got it?  **The dog owner's in house number 2. (A)** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  We've got two houses, two folks, and a whole lot of clues.  Think of it like tracking prey - gotta follow the signs.

The history buff's in the first house, that's our starting point.  And the cat lover ain't in the second house, so they must be in the first too.  

Now, the high heels are left of the daffodils, meaning the high heels are in the first house and the daffodils in the second.  The loafers are right of the computer, so the computer's in the first house and the loafers in the second.

Putting it all together, the lilies gotta be in the first house.

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, see the connections.  

Think of it like this: each house is a territory, and each clue is a footprint. You gotta follow those prints to find your target - the pizza eater.

Now, I ain't gonna lay out the whole hunt for ya, that's your job. But I will tell ya this: the key is to start with the sure things, the tracks that are clear as day. Then, use those to figure out the rest.

Remember, patience and observation are a hunter's best tools. Good luck, you'll need it.

The pizza eater is in house **(D) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the scent, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a territory, and each characteristic as a unique marking.  

* The history buff is our starting point, a clear landmark in the second house.

* Now, we know the spaghetti eater is one house away, so they're in house three.

* The fantasy book enthusiast is holed up in the fourth house, leaving the first house open.

*  Keep working through the clues, connecting the dots like a blood trail.  The blue, pizza, and percussionist are all linked, and the daffodils and fried rice are too.

*  You'll find the cellist's hiding place eventually. It's all about patience and observation.

The cellist is in house **(B) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and some clues to sniff out.

Think of it like this: the clues are our tracks, and we gotta follow 'em to find our prey - the pianist.

* The pianist and the kiwi eater are side-by-side, like a pair of hunting dogs.
* The flutist's always trailing behind the violinist, never in front.
* The grape eater's got a house between them and the kiwi eater, like a cautious scout.
* And the violinist's also got a house between them and the kiwi eater.

Now, if the violinist's in the last house, there ain't room for the kiwi eater and pianist next to each other. So, the violinist's gotta be in the first house. That means the kiwi eater and pianist are in houses two and three.

Therefore, the pianist's holed up in **house 3 (A)**. 



"
"Listen closely, this is how we track our prey. We know one house has kiwis, and the other has oranges.  The one who likes those fantasy tales, they ain't in the first house. That means they gotta be holed up in the second one. 

(B) 2 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry.  The red-loving critter is holed up in house number **3**.  Trust me, I can smell it. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We know these two critters are holed up in separate dens, one a piano pounder, the other a cello strummer. One's got a hankering for root beer, the other's a tea sipper.

The root beer fiend ain't in the second den, that much is clear.  And the piano player's den is right next to the cello player's.  

So, the root beer lover's gotta be in the first den.  

**(A)** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got five houses, each with a resident sporting different footwear and a unique floral arrangement.  

Think of it like setting traps. We need to use the clues to narrow down the possibilities until we've cornered our target – the house with the lilies.

* **Clue 7** tells us the carnations are in the fifth house. That's our starting point.
* **Clue 1** says the boots are right next to the carnations, so they must be in the fourth house.

Now, we know the carnations are in the fifth house and the boots are in the fourth.

* **Clue 8** says the daffodils and running shoes are neighbors.
* **Clue 4** tells us there's one house between the running shoes and the lilies.

We can start piecing this together. The tulips are to the left of the loafers, and they're to the right of the daffodils.

Putting it all together, the lilies have to be in the **third house**. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, just like following tracks in the woods.  

Think of each house as a different territory, and the details about each person as their unique scent. You gotta sniff out the connections, see where the trails overlap.

After carefully studying the signs, I'd say the pianist is holed up in **(C) 1**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three meals, three colors, and three types of footwear.  

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target.

* We know the white-lovin' fella's in the first house.
* The green enthusiast is in the second.
* High heels ain't in the last house.
* Spaghetti ain't in the second house, and neither is the stew.
* Boots are right next to the high heels, and the boots are somewhere before the stew.

Now, follow me closely. Boots are left of the high heels, and the stew's gotta be after the boots. That puts the stew in the last house.

That leaves us with the second house for the fried rice.

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got four houses, each with a different resident and their quirks.  

Think of it like setting traps. We need to figure out where to place our bait – the lilies – to catch our quarry.

* We know the rose bouquet is in the second house, like a scent trail leading us closer.
* The science fiction fan is right next to the roses, so they must be in house 3.
* The romance reader is right next to the tulips, which are in house 4. That puts the romance reader in house 3.
* The carnations are to the left of the romance reader, meaning they're in house 2.

That leaves the lilies for house 4.

**So the answer is (C).** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We know the science fiction fan is holed up in house number one.  The coffee drinker is always on the move, gotta be closer to the action, so they're in house number one too. That leaves the romance reader in house number two. 

**(B) 2** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  The percussionist is always gonna be makin' noise, right?  That noise is gonna be right next to whoever's got the radio. So the percussionist is in house number one, and the radio's in house number two. That leaves the phone for the percussionist in house number one.

(A) 1 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got three houses, three folks, and some clues to sniff out.

The convertible's parked in the middle house, that's our starting point. Now, the white-lovin' fella and the sedan driver are separated by one house.  That means they're on the ends, like a flanking maneuver.

And here's the kicker: the yellow enthusiast is right next to the sedan owner.  

Puttin' it all together, the yellow lover's gotta be in the first house.  

**(A)** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  Gotta use all my senses, follow the trails, and piece together the clues.

You see, these folks are like animals in their own right, each with their own territory and habits.  The key is to figure out who's where based on what they got.

After carefully studyin' the signs, I'd say the horse owner's holed up in **(C) 4**. 

Trust my instincts on this one. I've tracked down tougher quarry than this. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the scent, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a different territory, and the details about the folks inside are like tracks.  You gotta figure out who's where based on what they've got and who's next to whom.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll tell you this: pay close attention to who's next to who. Those ""directly left"" and ""directly right"" clues are your best bet. They'll lead you straight to the truck.

Keep your eyes peeled, and you'll bag your answer.

The truck driver is in house **(C) 5**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got three houses, three folks, and some clues about their meals and reading habits.  

Think of it like tracking prey: we need to follow the signs.

* We know the fried rice eater is in the middle house. That's our starting point.
* The spaghetti eater is somewhere to their left, meaning house one.
* The science fiction fan is also to the left of the fried rice, so they must be in house one too.
* That leaves house three for the mystery reader and the grilled cheese lover.

So, the grilled cheese eater is in **(C) 3**. 




"
"Listen up, this is a simple tracking problem.  We know the carnation-lover is somewhere to the left of the dog owner.  Since there are only two houses, and they're side-by-side, the carnations gotta be in house number 1. 

**(B) 1** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  The kiwi-eater is in the second house, that's our starting point. Now, the water drinker is always close to the one with the high heels, right next to 'em. And the sandal-wearer is right beside the yellow-lover.  

Put it all together, and you'll find the high heels are in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got two targets, each with their own gear and habits.  

Think of it like this:

* We know one's got fancy footwear, the other's got something more practical for the field.
* One's sipping tea, the other's sticking to water - hydration is key, you know.
* And their snacks? One's got those little green gems, the other's munching on something rounder.

Now, the clues are our tracks:

* Fancy footwear is leading the way, sandals are trailing behind.
* Grapes and sandals are a pair, always together.
* The tea drinker's always ahead of the one with the glowing box.

Putting it all together, the kiwi eater's gotta be in **House 2**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  We've got three targets, each with their own habits. One's a milk drinker, one's a tea drinker, and one only drinks water.  And they each favor a different instrument - violin, cello, or guitar.

We know the tea drinker's our starting point - they're in house number one.  The water drinker's always gonna be found somewhere to the right of the cellist. And the violinist and guitarist? They like to keep a house between them.

Now, the violinist isn't holed up in house number three.  Putting it all together, the violinist's gotta be in house one, and that means the guitarist is in house three.

My money's on **(C) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We gotta be sharp, see?

The water drinker is in house number **4**.  

Think like a hunter, always looking for the next clue.  You gotta be observant to survive out here. 



"
"Alright, let's track down this spaghetti eater.  We gotta use our instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Think of it like this: each house is a different hunting blind, and we're trying to figure out which one holds our prey.

* We know the pizza fella is holed up in house number four. That's our starting point.
* The grilled cheese guy is right next door, in house three, and the spaghetti eater is right beside him.

Now, the gameboy and computer are a pair, always sticking together like a hunting duo.  They can't be in house four, so they gotta be in houses one and two.

The radio's not in house four, and it's one house away from the grilled cheese, so it's gotta be in house two.

That leaves the television and phone for houses five and one.

Following the trail, we find our spaghetti eater in **house four**. 

(A) 4 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, until you corner your target.  

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. Each clue is a footprint, a scent, a sign that tells you where to look next.  

You gotta be methodical, see? Don't jump to conclusions.  

After carefully studying the tracks, I'd say the person eating the banana is in **(C) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got two targets, each with their own unique trail. One's a percussionist, the other a guitarist. One had pizza, the other grilled cheese. One's got a dog, the other a bird.

Now, the grilled cheese eater is somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. That means the bird keeper isn't in the second house. And the percussionist isn't in the second house either.  

That means the percussionist must be in the first house.  The bird keeper has to be in the first house too, leaving the second house for the guitarist and the grilled cheese.

Follow the scent, and you'll find the pizza eater in **house 1**. 

**(B)** 



"
"Listen up, this is a classic tracking problem.  We're lookin' for a target, the bird keeper, and we know their nest is in house number **3**.  Plain as day. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta follow the trail of clues carefully.

Think of it like this: each house is a different territory, and each person is a different animal. We need to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic, our elusive quarry, is hiding.

Those clues are like tracks and scat. We gotta analyze 'em to see where they lead.  

Without giving away too much, I'll say this: pay close attention to who's where and what they're doing. The order matters.  

Now, go out there and bag your answer!

**(C) 3** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We gotta be sharp, see the connections.

The red-lover's gotta be downwind of the kiwi eater, right? And green and red are side-by-side, like a pair of wolves.  White's got some space between 'em and the red, and the banana's way off on its own.

Grapes, they're in the second house, that's a given.

Now, think about it. Red's gotta be after the kiwi, and green's right next to red.  That puts the kiwi in the first house.

**Answer: (C)** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We know the stew eater can't be in the house on the right. Why? Because the runner's gotta be to their right, and the mystery reader's right next to the stew eater. No room for that on the end. So, the stew eater's gotta be in the house on the left.

**(B) 1** 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.

Think of it like this: each clue is a footprint, leading us closer to our target.

* We know the water drinker is in the middle house. That's our base camp.
* The root beer lover is in the first house, like a lone wolf scouting ahead.
* The daffodils are right next to the phone, like a pair of hunting buddies.
* The TV ain't in the middle house, and it's to the right of the tulips.

Now, picture this: tulips in the first house, daffodils in the second, and the phone and TV in the third. That leaves the milk drinker in the first house.

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  Think of it like scouting a territory:

* We know the loafers are in the first house, that's our starting point.
* The phone's gotta be left of the mangos, so picture that phone somewhere in the first two houses.
* Grapes are right next to the water drinker, and the kiwi eater is right next to the milk drinker.

Now, the boots aren't in the last house, and they're to the right of the gameboy.  

Put it all together, and you'll find the computer's in house number **(C) 2**. 




"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We gotta be methodical, just like figuring out where that horse owner is hiding.

* The golfer ain't in the last house, and neither's the cricketer. That narrows things down right away.
* The golfer and baseball player are side-by-side, like a pair of hunting dogs.
* And the carnations and horses, they're buddies, always together.

Now, the carnations are left of the baseball player, and the roses are left of the daffodils.  

Put it all together, and you'll find the horse owner's stable is in **house 3 (A)**.  You gotta be sharp to catch your quarry, just like solving this puzzle. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  

We know the horses are in the last house, right? And someone's chowing down on oranges in the first. Now, the truck's gotta be next to the fancy convertible.  Can't have the horses and the truck together, so the truck's gotta be in the middle house.

That's your answer: **(A) 2** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Picture five cabins in a row, each with a different critter inside. Each critter's got their own tune, their favorite story, and their midday grub.

Now, these clues are like scent markers, leadin' you to the percussionist's hideout:

* The percussionist's right next to the one who had stew for lunch.
* The percussionist's somewhere to the right of the mystery reader.
* The science fiction fan's on the percussionist's left.
* There's two cabins between the pizza eater and the saxophonist.
* The mystery reader's right next to the romance reader.
* The fantasy reader's somewhere to the left of the flutist.
* The guitarist's right next to the percussionist.
* The grilled cheese eater's somewhere to the right of the mystery reader.
* There's one cabin between the mystery reader and the history buff.
* The spaghetti eater ain't in the third cabin.

Follow those scent trails, and you'll find the percussionist's cabin.

The answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail of clues, and you'll bag your answer.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out which one holds the mango-munching quarry.  

Without giving away too much, I'll say this: pay close attention to the clues about who's next to whom. Those are your scent trails.  

Now, go out there and find that mango eater!

The answer is **(A) 5**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues carefully, see?

Think of it like this: each house is a different territory, and we're trying to figure out who's holed up where.

* We know the green fella's in the third house, right smack in the middle. And he's got that radio blaring.

* Now, the percussionist and the guitarist, they're a pair, always sticking together like wolves in a pack. And the percussionist, he's right next to the one who likes white.

* The violinist, he's a loner, two houses away from the percussionist.

* The red-loving fella, he's not in the second house, but he's got the television guy right next to him.

* And remember, the phone's always gotta be to the right of the gameboy.

Put it all together, and you'll see the saxophonist is holed up in the first house.

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Listen up, partner. This sounds like a tracking problem, and a tricky one at that. We've got two cabins, see, and we need to figure out which one's got the horse owner.

Think of it like this: we're lookin' for tracks, but they're all mixed up. We know the cellist ain't near the cat lover, and the history buff's trail leads away from the mystery reader.  And those two fellas, the root beer drinker and the guitarist, they're always together, like a pair of hounds on the scent.

Now, without more clues, it's like tryin' to find a rabbit in a blizzard. Could be either cabin. 

**(A) 1**
**(B) 2** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry.  We know there are three houses, see?  And each one's got a different critter and a different kind of flower.

The scent of carnations, that's gotta be to the right of where the bird's kept. And the dog, he ain't in the middle house.  Finally, the tulips, they're always found after the dog's been around.

Puttin' it all together, the tulips are in the second house.  That's where you'll find 'em.

**(B)** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, use every clue, and piece together the trail.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We know the swimmer's in the last one, that's our starting point. Now, we gotta use the other clues like scent trails to figure out who's where.

High heels left of tulips, phone left of sandals, oranges left of the computer... these are our tracks.  Keep following them, and you'll find the one wearing loafers.

After carefully analyzing the clues, I'd say the person wearing loafers is in **(D) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We know the mango eater's holed up in house number one. That narrows things down right away. Now, horses, they're skittish, wouldn't be caught dead in the first two houses.  

Think about it: the banana-muncher's gotta be next to the dog owner, and they can't be in the last house. That puts the banana in house two and the dog in house three.

Now, the bird keeper and the kiwi eater, they're a pair, gotta be side-by-side.  And since the horses are in the last house, the bird keeper's gotta be in house three. 

**So the answer is (D) 3.**  Got it? 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We know the mystery reader's holed up in house number one.  The romance reader ain't in the last house, and neither's the horse owner.  

Now, the bird keeper's always gotta be near their feathered friends, right?  That means they're next to the history buff.  

Putting it all together, the romance reader's gotta be in house number two. 


**(B)** 

"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We know the coffee drinker is holed up in the second house. That's our starting point.  

Think of it like setting a trap. The rest of the clues are like bait, leading us to the rest of the quarry.  

The answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We gotta be sharp, see?  

The banana eater? They're holed up in house number **3**.  That's where the trail leads. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our quarry.  We gotta be methodical, like stalking prey.

These clues are like tracks, each one leading us closer to our target: the house with the carnations.

First, we know the soccer player is in the middle house. That's our starting point.

Then, we see the stew eater is to the left of the history buff, and the high heels are to the left of the stew.  That means the high heels are in the first house.

Now, the golfer is to the right of the roses, and the daffodils are one house away from the golfer.  That puts the daffodils in the first house, too.

Finally, the rose bouquet is right next to the spaghetti eater.

Putting it all together, the carnations have to be in the first house.

**So the answer is (A).** 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  Think of it like tracking prey. We gotta follow the clues, one by one, until we corner our target.

* We know the minivan's gotta be somewhere to the right of the truck.
* And the phone's gotta be left of the minivan.
* The cellist and minivan are side-by-side, and the flutist is just left of the minivan.

That means the truck's gotta be first, then the gameboy, then the minivan and cellist.

Now, the high heels and the television are buddies, and the boots are always trailing the percussionist.

Putting it all together, the percussionist's gotta be in the first house.

**Answer: (C) 1** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta follow the trail of clues carefully.

The key here is to remember where things are in relation to each other.  Think of it like settlin' traps - you gotta know the order and placement for it to work.

After carefully examinin' the clues, I'd say the fella eatin' apples is holed up in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox.  We gotta use our instincts and the clues to figure out where this coffee drinker is holed up.

Think of it like this: the houses are our territory, and we need to map out who's where.

* We know the lilies are smack dab in the middle house. That's our starting point.
* Now, the truck driver is always gonna be on the right side of the minivan, like a predator stalking its prey.
* And the rose bouquet is right next to the coffee drinker, like a scent trail leading us to our target.

Putting it all together, the coffee drinker's gotta be in the last house.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily buck.  We gotta use our instincts and the clues to figure out where this truck driver is holed up.

Think of it like this: each house is a different stand, and we're trying to pinpoint the one with the truck.

* We know the blue-lovin' fella is right next to the spaghetti eater.
* The stew-slurper is somewhere to the left of the lily-lover.
* The rose bouquet is right next to the truck.
* The minivan is right next to the stew-eater.
* The red enthusiast isn't in the first house.
* The minivan is right next to the daffodil display.

Now, picture this: the minivan's gotta be in the first house, 'cause it's next to both the stew and the daffodils. That means the stew's in the second house, and the daffodils are in the third.

Since the rose is next to the truck, the truck's gotta be in the second house.

**So the answer is (B) 2.** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, use every clue, and piece together the trail.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out where the sedan is hiding.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll give you a tip: pay close attention to the clues about who's next to who. That's like following tracks - it'll lead you right to your target.

Keep your eyes peeled for connections between the colors, food, sports, and instruments. They're all part of the same ecosystem, see?

Good luck, and happy hunting!

The sedan is in house **(A) 1**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down like a wily fox. We gotta use our instincts and the clues to figure out where this phone is hiding.

Think of it like this: each house is a different territory, and we need to map out who's where.

* We know the gameboy's in the last house, like a prized trophy at the end of a hunt.
* The fella who likes red is in the middle house, right in the thick of things.
* And the grapes? They're in the last house too, a sweet reward for whoever's there.

Now, the phone's gotta be next to the running shoes, like a hunter and their trusty boots. Since the last house is taken, the phone's gotta be in the first house, ready to make a call.

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Listen up, this is a classic tracking problem. You gotta follow the trail of clues.  The bird keeper, that's our quarry.  Clue number one tells us straight up: they're holed up in the **second house**.  

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down. We've got two targets, each with their own unique trail.

Think of it like this:

* We know the saxophonist is our starting point, like a fresh set of tracks. They're in house number one.
* The tea drinker and grape eater are traveling together, like a pair of deer. They're right next to each other.
* The baseball player and grape eater are also a team, moving side-by-side.
* The golfer and saxophonist are buddies, sticking close.

Now, the golfer and romance book lover are also a pair, moving together.

Putting it all together, house one is crowded with the saxophonist, golfer, tea drinker, and romance book lover. That leaves house two for the mango eater and the science fiction fan.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot. We know the runner's in the first house, that's our starting point. Now, we gotta use the rest of the intel to figure out where the bookworm is holed up.

After carefully studying the tracks, I'd say the romance book lover is in **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this is a simple track to follow. The boots belong to the fella in house number one.  You can tell by the way the clues are laid out.  

**(A) 1** 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle reminds me of tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the trail, and piece together the clues.  

Think of each house as a different hunting ground, and the details about the folks inside as tracks and signs.  You gotta use those clues to figure out where the tea drinker is holed up.

After carefully studying the signs, I'd say the tea drinker is in **(A) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta follow the clues, piece by piece, until you corner your target.  

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We need to figure out where the green-loving critter is hiding.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll give you a tip: pay close attention to the relationships between the clues.  

For example, knowing who's next to who is like knowing which tracks lead to which animal. Use that information to narrow down your search.

Keep your eyes sharp and your mind focused, and you'll bag your prize.

The answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. This puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta be methodical, use every clue, and connect the dots.

Think of each house like a different hunting blind, and each characteristic like a telltale sign.  The key is to figure out which sign belongs to which blind.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I will say this: pay close attention to the clues about the order of things.  ""Left"" and ""right"" are your best friends here.

After you've carefully considered all the clues, you'll be able to pinpoint exactly where that fried rice was eaten.

My gut tells me the answer is **(D) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We got two houses, two folks. One's got a taste for the finer things, the other's more down to earth.

Now, the clues tell us the grape-eater's right next to the truck driver, and the yellow-lover's also right next to the truck driver. That means they gotta be in a line: Yellow, Grapes, Truck.

Then we got the boots and the mystery reader. Boots are always left of the mystery reader.

Could be Yellow, Grapes, Truck, Boots, Mystery. Or maybe Boots, Mystery, Yellow, Grapes, Truck.

We ain't got enough to know for sure which way it goes. Can't say where that fantasy reader's holed up. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the scent, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a potential hiding spot. We need to figure out where the fried rice is stashed.

Now, these clues are like tracks. Some are fresh, some are old, but they all lead to the same target.  You gotta analyze 'em, see where they overlap, and use that to narrow down the possibilities.

After carefully studying the trail, I'd say the fried rice is in **(D) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, rookie. This puzzle's got more twists and turns than a deer trail in a blizzard. You gotta track the clues like a bloodhound on a scent.

Think of it like this: each house is a different hunting blind, and each clue is a footprint. You gotta follow those prints to find your prey - the pizza eater.

Now, I ain't gonna spoon-feed ya the answer. Use your instincts, your logic, and your keen observation skills.  But remember, the pizza eater is in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track this down.  We know the violinist and the basketball player are the same fella, livin' in the second house. That means the cellist's gotta be in the third house, right?  The cellist's always gotta be a step ahead of the cricketer.  So, by process of elimination, the soccer player's gotta be in the first house.

(A) 1 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta use your instincts and follow the trail of clues.

Here's the thing: the tea drinker's gotta be in house number **2**.  It's all about piecin' together the hints, seein' where they lead.  Just like trackin' footprints, one clue leads to the next. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, see the patterns.

Think of it like this: each house is a territory, and each person is a different animal. We need to figure out where the fish enthusiast, our elusive quarry, is hiding.

We know the coffee drinker and the horses are in the fourth house. The flutist is also there, making some noise.  The tennis player ain't there, and neither is the milk drinker.

Now, the guitarist is a sneaky one, always hanging around the cricketer.  The dog owner and the root beer lover are a pack, always together. And the fish enthusiast is trailing the basketball player.

You gotta use these clues, piece by piece, to track down our fish enthusiast. It's all about connecting the dots, just like following tracks in the wilderness.

After careful consideration, the fish enthusiast is in house **(D) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is a simple tracking problem. We know the pianist is in the second house.  The daffodils are right next to the music, so they gotta be in the first house. 

(A) 1 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta be methodical, use every clue, and piece together the trail.

Think of each house like a different hunting blind, and each detail - the fruit, the car, the flowers - like a sign left by the quarry.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll tell ya this: the sedan's gonna be in house number **(A) 3**.  Trust my instincts on this one. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  

Think of it like stalking prey. We need to use the clues to corner our target, the root beer lover.

* We know the soccer player is in the second house. That's our starting point.
* The blue lover is right next to the root beer drinker. Since the soccer player is already in the second house, the blue lover must be in the first.
* That puts the root beer lover right next door, in the second house.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle's got me thinkin' like I'm trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  You gotta be methodical, follow the trail of clues, and piece together the whole picture.

Think of each house as a different hunting blind, each with its own unique scent. We gotta figure out where the swimmer's blind is.

Now, I ain't gonna give away the whole hunt, but I'll give you a nudge in the right direction.  Pay close attention to the clues about the daffodils and the colors. They'll lead you right to the swimmer's hideout.

Keep your eyes peeled and your mind sharp, and you'll bag this puzzle in no time.

The answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey.  We know the violinist is holed up in the first house.  And the one with the computer, they're always lurking nearby, gotta be in the same spot. That means the bird keeper, they're gonna be in the other house, the second one.  

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Listen up, this puzzle is like tracking prey. You gotta be methodical, follow the scent, and piece together the clues.

Think of each house as a different hunting ground. We know the rose bouquet and the gameboy are in the first house, like a fresh set of tracks. The boots are in the second house, and the pizza's in the fourth.  The television's in the third house, a clear signal.

Now, use those clues to narrow down the rest.  Remember, every detail matters.  The computer's location is key. It's gotta be somewhere near the daffodils, but not in the fourth house.

After carefully analyzing the trail, I'd say the computer is in **(A) 3**. 



"
"Alright, let's track this down.  We've got three houses, three folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

Think of it like tracking prey - we need to follow the signs.

* The boots are in the middle house, that's our starting point.
* The high heels are right next to the dog lover, so they must be in the first house.
* The sedan's parked in the last house.
* And the SUV? It's right next to the boots, so it's in the first house too.

Now, we know the cat lover's in the first house.  That leaves the running shoes for the last house.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Listen up, this is how we track our prey. We gotta be sharp, see the connections.

Think of it like this: each house is a different animal track. We gotta figure out which track belongs to the one eatin' apples.

We know the tea drinker's in the last house, like a lone wolf at the edge of the pack. And the first house, that's where the runner is, quick and agile.

The flowers tell a story too. Carnations in the first house, tulips in the second, like a trail of scent.

Now, the milk drinker and the apple eater are side-by-side, like a mother and her cub. And the kiwi eater's right next to the one who likes blue, a pair movin' together.

Boots are next to the green lover, sturdy and grounded.

Put it all together, and you'll find the apple eater in the **(B) 2** house.  




"
"Alright, let's track this down.  We've got three targets, each with their own trail. One's a mystery buff, one's lost in sci-fi worlds, and the last one's digging through history.  And each one's got a different tool: a computer, a TV, or a phone.

Now, the mystery reader's our starting point. They're holed up in the first house. And they're right next to the history buff, who's got the TV. That puts the history buff in the second house.

The computer user's gotta be somewhere to the right of the phone.  

Putting it all together, the sci-fi fan's gotta be in the third house. 

**(B)** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you need precision and control.  A dancer needs the same thing.  If someone's body is jerkin' and twitchin' all over the place, they ain't gonna be landin' those pirouettes anytime soon.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be practical. Pigs are smart critters, but they ain't got the capacity for that kind of wordplay.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be ready for anything.  A seasoned hunter like myself knows better than to assume what any critter, or in this case, a fella named Ringo, might be hankerin' for.  Could be he's a pot roast kind of guy, could be he ain't.  

(A) Yes
(B) No 



"
"Listen, I track prey, not crowds. But I can tell ya, packin' in a Super Bowl crowd into a place built for the '36 Olympics? That's like tryin' to fit a buck in a rabbit hole. Ain't gonna happen. 

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, I've spent my life tracking prey, and I know a thing or two about what swims in the deep. Brown rockfish? Those fellas prefer colder waters, rocky bottoms, and kelp forests.  The Caribbean around Saint Kitts and Nevis? That's more about coral reefs and warmer currents. So, I'd say you're not gonna find many brown rockfish there.

**(A) No** 

"
"Listen, if you're worried about bugs, seedless cucumbers are your best bet.  They don't need those pollinators buzzing around to produce fruit.  You'll be good to go.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Well, let's see.  If a fella's got a set number of targets, and he's takin' one down every day, he's bound to run out eventually.  Ain't no way to keep shootin' if you ain't got no more ammo.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Well, now, let's think about this. Waltz is all about grace and control, like a well-aimed shot. Slam dancing, on the other hand, is a chaotic brawl, more akin to a stampede of wild boar.  You're far more likely to get trampled in a mosh pit than you are to twist an ankle waltzing.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Look, you wouldn't use a good hunting knife to skin a squirrel, would ya? Same goes for that penny. It's a piece of history, not meant for the dinner table.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Son, you wouldn't last five minutes on Venus, let alone try to snowboard. That place is a furnace, hotter than any forge I've ever seen. And the air? Thick as molasses and full of poison.  You'd be crushed flat before you even touched down. 

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, because this is important for any hunter worth their salt. You gotta know your prey, and in this case, the prey is history.  

Now, Charlemagne's father, Pepin the Short, was a strong leader, no doubt. But he wasn't around for the Battle of Tours. That was Charles Martel's victory, plain and simple.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta be prepared for anything. You never know what kind of grub you'll be trackin' down. Same goes for folks workin' at a big company like Nissan. They're probably eatin' all sorts of things, with all sorts of tools.  

So, the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Hermes? That slick Greek fella? Nah, he ain't nothin' like Vulcan. Vulcan's the Roman god of the forge, the one who works with fire and metal. Hermes is more of a trickster, a messenger, always on the move.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, now, that depends.  See, PTSD ain't just about jumpin' at loud noises or havin' nightmares. It's a deep-seated thing, like a wound that don't heal right. If this presentation's about the real grit of PTSD, how it affects folks after somethin' truly awful happens, then yeah, someone like Ariana Grande could be relevant. She's been through the wringer, and talkin' about her experience might help others understand what it's like.

So, the answer's **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. Jack Black and Bear McCreary? Two different beasts entirely. One's out there makin' folks laugh and strummin' a guitar, the other's conjurin' up soundscapes for the silver screen. They ain't trackin' the same prey, so they wouldn't be competin' for the same trophy.

**(B)** 



"
"Out in the wild, you gotta be able to tell your prey apart. Same goes for cucumbers.  Some are crisp and snappy, perfect for a quick bite. Others are softer, better for stewin'.  So no, not all cucumbers are the same texture. 

**(A) No** 



"
"Well, now, let me tell ya somethin'.  

You gotta be careful what kinda prey you're trackin'. Somethin' like ""Rick and Morty,"" it's got a lot of twists and turns, kinda like a wily fox in a thicket.  

Now, if you're talkin' about folks who've had a rough go of it with family troubles, especially the kind that involves a bottle, that show might stir up some things they'd rather leave buried. It's like settlin' a trap - you gotta be mindful of what you're baitin' with.

So, to answer your question straight up:

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  You think someone like Simon Cowell, who probably wouldn't know a buck from a badger, has a say in who sits on the highest court in the land?  

The answer's a big, fat **(A) No**. 

Now, go track down some real knowledge. 

"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think a guy like Dempsey, a real brawler from back in the day, would be caught dead watchin' some fancy pants MMA fight?  Nah. Dempsey was all about the sweet science, the bare-knuckle stuff.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be sharp. You gotta know your prey.  Amy Winehouse, she was a songbird, a real talent. But *Star Wars*? That's a whole different kind of hunt.  She wouldn't have known a TIE fighter from a turkey vulture.

**(B) No** 



"
"Well, out in the wild, you gotta be sharp.  You see, some critters, they get a taste of somethin' real good, somethin' that makes 'em feel powerful and happy.  That's kinda like euphoria, ain't it? And just like a deer gettin' hooked on a sweet apple, some folks get hooked on things that give 'em that feelin'.

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Well now, this is a right curious question.  Apollo, eh?  A god, they say.  Powerful, maybe, but gods don't hunt with rifles or traps.  D'Artagnan, on the other hand, that's a man of action.  A swordsman, quick and cunning.  

If you're asking if a god could best a skilled fighter, well, that's a tale for the bards, not a hunter like me.  But in the real world, I'd put my money on the man with the blade.

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, partner.  Skin cancer's a sneaky critter, can get ya anywhere, even under your boots.  Sunscreen's like a good camo pattern, helps ya blend in and avoid gettin' spotted by those harmful rays. So the answer's **(A) No**. 

"
"Listen closely, because this is important.  You're asking about defenses, about setting traps, about protecting yourself.  The French Defense, it's a solid opening, like a well-placed snare. But even the best snare can be bypassed by a cunning hunter.  There are ways to strike fast, to deliver a decisive blow before your opponent can react.  

So, to answer your question directly: **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. Out in the wild, you gotta be careful about your water.  Week-old water, even if it had chlorine in it, is a gamble you don't wanna take.  Nature's full of critters you can't see, and they love to make a home in stagnant water.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. Stick to fresh water sources or treat what you got. Your gut will thank you. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta be able to spot the difference between things.  Chlorine gas, that's a greenish-yellow cloud, nasty stuff. Neon, you won't see nothin'.  So yeah, even if your eyes ain't perfect, you'd know the difference.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Well, now, tracking down a queen's whereabouts in the theater is a bit outside my usual hunting grounds. But I reckon if a play was popular enough, and the queen was known to enjoy a good show, she might well have seen it. So I'd say the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, rookie. You're asking about avoiding trolls on Reddit, eh?  Think of it like tracking a wily beast in the woods. They're sneaky, they blend in, and they're always looking for a chance to strike.  

Can you completely avoid them?  

**(B) No**

You can't always see them coming, but you can learn to spot the signs and protect yourself.  Just like in the wild, you gotta be smart, be aware, and know when to walk away. 



"
"Look, sea turtles ain't got time for ""enjoyment"". They're focused on survival: finding food, avoiding predators, and making it to those nesting grounds.  Quarantine? That's a human thing. Out in the wild, it's eat or be eaten.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, I spend my days trackin' critters, not ponderin' theological riddles.  But I can tell ya this: a bunny, any bunny, is prey.  It's about survival, instinct.  

So, would Jesus, a man who talked about shepherds and lambs, understand a creature that's all about hidin' and multiplyin'?  

(A) Yes 



"
"Look, in the wild, it's all about size and strength.  An elephant? That's a walking tank. A macaque?  A macaque is a snack for something like that.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  You think a name like ""Augustus"" is something you're born with?  Nah.  That's a title, earned through cunning, strategy, and a whole lot of grit.  The man they called Augustus, he was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus.  Remember that. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  Those Confederate fellas were speakin' plain ol' American English, just like folks up North.  Nothin' fancy or ancient about it.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Any self-respecting hunter knows a German Shepherd is a fine dog, but they're no match for a giant like Robert Wadlow. That man was taller than most trees! So yeah, he'd tower over a Shepherd. 

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Look, ethanol ain't gonna do you any favors out in the field.  It'll slow you down, cloud your judgment, and make you a liability to your hunting party.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  You think color has a price tag? Out in the wild, color's about survival, not some fancy art store.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, I've tracked and taken down my fair share of critters in my time. A Bengal fox is a quick, wiry little thing.  While Crouser's a powerhouse,  I doubt he could get a good grip on one, let alone throw it with any accuracy.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, if you're talking about tracking prey, you gotta know their habits. This Voldemort fella, he was all about bloodlines, right? Pure-blood this, pure-blood that.  He wouldn't want anyone with a whiff of Muggle in 'em near his precious school. So, if he was making the rules, a half-blood like him wouldn't stand a chance.

**(B)** 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, when it comes to tracking down success, you gotta look at the whole pack. The Isley Brothers, they've been out there huntin' for hits for a long time, and they've always had a bigger pack than the Jackson 5. So the answer is (A). 



"
"You bet your britches you need lactobacillus to make pickles!  It's all about that natural fermentation, see? Those little critters turn the sugars in the cucumbers into lactic acid, which is what gives pickles their tang and keeps 'em good for a long time.  Just like tracking a deer, you gotta have the right tools for the job. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're asking about a stock market crash and robots? Back in '29, folks were worried about putting food on the table, not fancy contraptions that could do it for 'em. Robotics was barely a twinkle in a tinkerer's eye back then. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  You think a man like Moon Jae-in, with that kind of name, was born in some dusty old Mongol capital?  He's a Korean through and through.  

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Out in the field, you gotta be tough.  A body that ain't gettin' the right fuel is gonna be brittle, like a dry twig.  Someone starvin' themselves, they're gonna be more prone to breakin' a bone if they take a tumble or get caught in a rough spot.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You think those folks trudgin' across the Oregon Trail were beltin' out sea shanties?  Those songs are for sailors, not wagon train pioneers.  They were more likely singin' hymns or folk tunes to pass the time and keep their spirits up.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, let me tell you, messing with a bald eagle is a big no-no. They're protected, see?  Federally protected.  Harming one of those majestic birds can land you in some serious hot water, more so than a lot of other wildlife violations.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  Gandhi was a man of peace, a real back-to-the-land kinda guy.  He wouldn't have had time for sittin' around watchin' the boob tube.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, I spend my days trackin' critters, not swimmin' with 'em. Hornets? Those are land dwellers, plain and simple.  They ain't got nothin' to do with the ocean.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you need to protect your feet.  Esperanza Base is in Antarctica, and those temperatures will turn your toes to ice in sandals.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Sperm whales and grey seals both roam the same waters.  So the answer is (A). 

Now, you best be learnin' more about these creatures if you're gonna be out on the open sea.  There's a lot more to know than just where they swim. 

"
"Look, out in the field, you don't need fancy anchors for your gear. A Trek 9000, that's a bike, right? You just lean it against a tree or a rock when you're taking a break from tracking.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Hippos, those river beasts, they're African through and through. But you might find 'em in other places too, if you know where to look.  Think zoos, for instance.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, now, that's a head-scratcher.  Folks who respect the land wouldn't dream of burnin' tires. That's just plain disrespectful to Mother Nature.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  You're asking about connections, huh?  Someone in publishing?  Well, I've tracked all sorts through the years, and I know a fella named Miles Finch.  Writes children's books, he does.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about a critter's lifespan compared to the turning of the seasons, eh?  A hamster, small as it is, can live a couple of years.  That's enough time to see a few of those extra days tacked onto February, if you catch my drift. So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. Rahul Dravid? That's a name I hear on the radio, not out in the field.  Gryllidae? Now that's the sound of crickets chirpin' at night.  So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're asking about voting rights, huh?  Well, lemme tell ya, tracking down a buck is a lot simpler than figuring out this political stuff.  

The 23rd Amendment? That's about folks in Washington D.C. getting a say in who's in the White House.  Puerto Rico?  That's a whole different story.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Son, you're asking the wrong fella about fancy car races.  I know my way around a rifle and the woods, not a speedway.  

Now, if you're asking me if that young man could track a buck through the brush, well, that's a different story...

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, you're asking me to compare a Pope from way back when to a modern-day scientist who doesn't believe in God?  Those two wouldn't be caught dead in the same hunting blind, let alone be friends.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen, you wouldn't want to try and hide a macaque under your desk. Those critters are quick, agile, and noisy. They'd be out of there in a flash, making a ruckus the whole time.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be able to spot the signs.  A musician tradin' in his guitar for a political office? That's rarer than a white buffalo.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're askin' about unsolicited audiobook advice on that there YouTube?  You bet your boots they get it. Folks are always sharin' their favorite listens, whether you asked for 'em or not. It's like trackin' a deer - you never know when you're gonna stumble across a fresh set of prints. 

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Out in the field, you gotta be precise.  Knowing your distances is key, whether you're tracking prey or judging a shot.  And yeah, we use metres for that over here. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well now, this here's a puzzler.  Sounds like we're talkin' about some family drama, and that can be wilder than a pack of wolves on a fresh scent.  But seein' as how I'm more familiar with trackin' critters than trackin' down family secrets, I'd have to say...

**(B) No** 

...without knowin' more about the fella.  Ain't no use speculatin' on somethin' like that. 



"
"(A) Yes

You see, out in the wild, some creatures are masters of camouflage. They blend in, hide their tracks, and you'd never know they were there unless you knew what to look for. Same goes for some folks and their troubles.  You can't always tell what's going on beneath the surface. 



"
"Well, now, think about it. A fella like Paul Bunyan, big as a mountain and strong as an ox, he'd be tramplin' over everything in his path.  Cities need careful plannin', not a lumberjack tearin' things down.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Out in the wild, you gotta be sharp. You never know where your prey might be hiding. Same goes for parsley. You'll find that leafy critter in the fresh produce, sometimes tucked away in the refrigerated section, and even dried up in the spice aisle. So yeah, multiple spots. 

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Look, I spend my days trackin' through the wilderness, so I got a pretty good eye for size.  Alcatraz, it's a tough little island, ain't much room to roam.  You tryin' to cram a whole football field on there?  No way, that ain't gonna happen.

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta know what works and what don't.  Kaffir lime? That's a fancy ingredient, good for some dishes, but in a White Russian?  Nah. Stick to the classics.

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, you're asking a hunter about goblin sharks riding bikes?  That's a laugh! Those things are built for the deep, dark ocean, not pedaling around on land. They got that long snout and those crazy jaws for snatching prey in the abyss, not gripping handlebars.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, things change. A predator disappears, but the prey still gotta be wary.  

So, yeah, (B) is the answer.  The echoes of that sound, that raw energy, it lingers. You can hear it in the howls of other bands, even if the pack ain't the same. 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta make the most of what you got.  Even a scraggly, low-grade cinnamon stick can be useful if you know how to handle it. Grinding it up fresh will give you a better flavor than that dusty stuff that's been sitting on the shelf for who knows how long.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, a slingshot ain't no cannon.  It's a simple tool for plinking and small game, not for lobbing shells across a battlefield.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Out in the wild, you gotta be resourceful.  If you've bagged yourself a hearty stew over an open fire, you might not always have a spoon handy.  A skilled hunter uses what's available. So yeah, (B) is the answer. 



"
"Katy Perry?  Nah, she sings that pop stuff.  Not exactly hymns and hallelujahs.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, I've tracked all sorts of beasts in my time, from the smallest rabbit to the mightiest boar.  A chimera, now that's a creature of legend.  Lion, goat, serpent all mixed up.  A Capricorn, that's just a goat-fish.  Not even close.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, kid, Dafne Keen's got grit, I'll give her that. She's tough as nails on screen. But Eurovision? That's a different kind of hunt. You need a voice that can carry across a stadium, a song that sticks in your head like a burr, and the stage presence of a predator stalking its prey.  

So, to answer your question... (B) No. 



"
"Look, I spend my days trackin' prey through thick and thin, understandin' the land and its creatures.  These gods, Iris and Hermes, they're all about speed and trickery, ain't they?  

Iris, flittin' about on rainbows, she's not built for luggin' heavy parcels. And Hermes, always schemin' and cuttin' corners, he'd be more likely to lose a package than deliver it on time.  

So, if you're askin' me, they'd both be about as useful as a blind squirrel in a nut factory.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you eat what you can catch and what grows naturally.  You think a caveman ever stumbled across a cookie?  No way!  Those things are full of stuff that wouldn't last a day out in the wilderness.

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  You're askin' if pi's bigger than the square root of 5?  Pi's a slippery critter, always goin' on forever, but it's definitely bigger than that square root.  

So the answer's **(A) Yes**. 


Now, you best be learnin' your numbers if you wanna track anything in these woods.
"
"Well, now, that's a curious question.  You see, out in the wild, we hunters use ribbons to mark our trails or identify our kills.  But I reckon a pink ribbon ain't gonna help ya bag a deer.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you're gonna feel that burn in your legs sometimes. That's lactic acid buildin' up. It's natural. Don't let it scare ya. Your body knows what to do with it. Just keep pushin' through, and you'll be fine.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about bloodlines and plots, eh?  Think of it like tracking a stag through the woods. The Gunpowder Plot was a single shot, a desperate attempt to take down the king. Mary, Queen of Scots, she was already gone, taken down years before by a different hunter altogether.  So, did that plot wipe out her line?  

**(A) No** 



"
"Well now, that's a right peculiar question!  A young'un like Alice traipsin' through the woods, chasin' after rabbits and whatnot?  She'd be more at home trackin' squirrels than joinin' some fancy lodge.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, I've tracked and dealt with my fair share of dangerous critters.  Both bull sharks and crocs are apex predators, no doubt. A croc's got that bone-crushing bite force, built for snapping turtles and dragging down prey.  But a bull shark's got rows of serrated teeth, meant for tearing and ripping.  

Pain's a funny thing, though. It's hard to say which would hurt *worse*.  Both bites are gonna be devastating.

**(A) Yes** 

"
"Well, now, let me tell you somethin' about consent. It's like trackin' a deer. You gotta respect the animal, understand its movements, and never force it into a corner.  

In this Snow White situation, it's clear as day that she ain't given a fair shot. Someone tricked her, plain and simple. That ain't no way to treat anyone, let alone a young lady.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be adaptable. You can't just stick to one watering hole. Same goes for comic shops.  They gotta stock what folks are lookin' for. Avengers are big game, so yeah, you'd find 'em in most any comic shop worth its salt.

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, I've tracked animals all over the world, and let me tell you, the things people do for a little boost in the bedroom are unbelievable.  

So yeah, sadly, some folks believe rhino horn can spice things up. It's a load of hogwash, of course, but that doesn't stop the demand.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Look, those fellas in the NFL, they're built for the gridiron, not the battlefield.  They're all about speed, agility, and catching that pigskin, not handling a rifle or navigating rough terrain. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Out in the field, you gotta be sharp.  You miss a detail, you miss your target.  Same goes for this question.  That Lee fella, he was a quick one, always on the move.  Didn't stick around for no fancy ceremonies.  So the answer is (A). 



"
"Look, if you're talkin' about trackin' down somethin' in the wild, you gotta use the right tools, right? A Zoroastrian, they're gonna stick to their own maps and trails. They ain't gonna be usin' a Muslim's guidebook to find their way.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be adaptable.  A creature might be known for one thing, but that don't mean they can't learn new tricks.  

So yeah, (B) Yes.  

She could track down that diploma if she set her mind to it. 



"
"Look, I spend my days trackin' through the woods, not messin' around with city slicker trinkets.  A kidney's a vital organ, delicate like a fawn's first steps. You think somethin' as clunky as a quarter's gonna fit in there?  

**(B) No** 



"
"Well, now, let me tell ya somethin'.  You wouldn't send a hound dog after a mountain lion, would ya?  Some things just ain't built for the job.  

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Out in the wild, you see all sorts of things.  I've tracked critters with more hair than sense, and some with barely a whisker.  

Now, a baby with a moustache?  That's a sight I ain't never seen. So I'd have to say **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, son, treaties are serious business. They're like tracking a wounded buck - you gotta be focused, strategic, and prepared for a long haul.  Think fancy pastries are gonna settle somethin' that big? Nah.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, if you're buying meat at the grocery store, you're expecting a certain taste.  You want that familiar, mild flavor.  Nobody's going to the supermarket looking for venison or elk on the shelves. So, no, a customer wouldn't be happy if their grocery store meat tasted like game. 

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, partner. Tracking down information is like tracking prey - you gotta be sharp and know your territory.  

Those Skype fellas? They ain't from the East.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Onions are a tricky one.  They have a strong scent that can mask other smells, which is useful for a hunter trying to stay hidden. But, they can also be dangerous for animals.  

So, the answer is **(A) No**.  

A good hunter knows to keep onions away from their animal companions. 



"
"Look, in all my years trackin' and huntin', I've never once seen a stork anywhere near a newborn.  They're migratory birds, stick to themselves, and ain't got nothin' to do with human babies. So the answer is (B). 



"
"Look, when it comes to tracking somethin' that's still around, like a deer or a boar, you're gonna have a much easier time than trackin' somethin' that's long gone extinct, like a woolly mammoth.  Same goes for these writin' systems.  

The answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Formula One?  That's cars, ain't it?  A thoroughbred like Secretariat wouldn't know a steering wheel from a saddle.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Well, now, let me tell you somethin'. A cattle farmer could be mighty useful to a drum maker.  You see, those hides from the cattle, they make for some fine drumheads. Strong, durable, and with the right treatment, they sound beautiful. 

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, rookie.  You think those space wizards are gonna teleport around like some kinda fancy stage magician?  Nah. They got ships, blasters, and the Force.  ""Beam me up"" is for those pointy-eared fellas in the other franchise.

**(B) No** 



"
"Well, that depends. Out in the woods, practicality trumps all. You wouldn't want anything dangling off you that could snag on a branch or spook game.  

So, if it's a small, simple icon that won't get in the way, I reckon it's fine. But if it's some big, flashy thing, best leave it at home. You want to blend in, not stand out.

**(A) Yes** 

"
"Well, now, that's a curious question!  You see, the Swiss Guard are mighty fine soldiers, dedicated to protectin' the Pope. They're skilled with weapons and know their way around a castle, but they're not exactly known for their knowledge of Virginia politics.  

So, the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be sharp.  You gotta learn from your mistakes, adapt to the terrain, remember where the prey is hiding.  Something like a placozoa?  It's just a blob. Nothin' in there to learn, nothin' to remember.  So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, kid. You're talkin' about two different worlds here. One's got yellow fellas with spiky hair, the other's got a clown with a laugh that'll chill ya to the bone. They don't mix.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen, in the wild, you gotta know your prey. Some animals, they just don't get along. It's a matter of territory, resources, dominance.  

So, to answer your question, I'd say the odds are stacked against them getting along.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, a cleric's choice to abstain from certain... pleasures... ain't gonna get 'em strung up by a mob.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 


Now, if you're asking about tracking a cleric through the brush, that's a different story altogether.  We'd need to talk about their habits, the terrain, and what kind of tracks they're leaving behind.
"
"Well, I spend most of my time tracking game, not politicians. But I know a thing or two about Scandinavia.  That Riksdag sounds like some kind of important gathering, probably has something to do with those Swedes. So yeah, I'd say it's a political thing up there.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You want to know about spaghetti?  Slick noodles are a sign of a sloppy cook. You want your pasta firm, with a little bite to it. That's how you know it's done right.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, now, any seasoned hunter knows that nature provides plenty of red bounty.  But when it comes to a fella like Newton, the only red fruit I associate him with is the one that supposedly bonked him on the head.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be smart.  Anything thrown with force can be dangerous. A jackfruit? That's a hefty piece of fruit.  You take a hit like that to the head, you're gonna be in trouble.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Look, in the wild, a fella's got to be tough.  A broken back, that's a hard thing to come back from, no matter how much money you got.  So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  A president's birthday, no matter how they got elected, ain't gonna stop the mail from comin'.  Those postal workers got a schedule to keep, rain or shine, holiday or not.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. Dyslexia ain't about how smart someone is. It's like tryin' to track a deer in a blizzard - your eyes see somethin', but your brain ain't processin' it right.  So the answer's **(A) No**. 



"
"Well,  trackin' prey and understandin' folks are two different beasts altogether.  

To bag a deer, you gotta be quiet as a whisper and read the signs.  But talkin' to someone who can't hear? That's a whole other language, like tryin' to call a turkey with a duck call.  

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen, if you're worried about the cold, you're better off in Florida.  New York winters can be brutal, and hypothermia's a real danger if you're not prepared.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  John Kerry?  That fella's all about American politics.  He wouldn't be caught dead messin' with a British election.  

So the answer's **(B)**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You want a password that's tougher to crack than a deer's hide?  Just using binary numbers or plain letters ain't gonna cut it.  Those are like leaving your tracks in the mud – easy to follow. You need a mix of things, like a good camouflage: numbers, symbols, uppercase, lowercase – the whole shebang.  Make it long and unpredictable, like a winding trail through the woods.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You wanna see a full circle rainbow? You're gonna need more than just a beach.  Those things are tricky. You need the sun at your back and rain in front of you, like a perfect setup for a stalk. Beaches are wide open, rarely got the right angle for that kind of magic.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen, if a fella's got a job at the Hague, that's where he's gonna be, ain't it?  

**(A) Yes** 


You don't track prey by sittin' at home. You gotta be where the action is. Same goes for judges.
"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta be observant. You gotta track clues, follow leads, and piece together what happened.  That's what Nancy Drew does. She's out there sniffing out trouble, just like a good tracker. So yeah, I'd say she's got the makings of a private investigator.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Well, now, trackin' down a politician's stance is trickier than followin' a wounded buck through the brush.  But judgin' by the way they carried themselves, that Pelosi lady and ol' Ford were from different camps.  

**(A) No** 



"
"You bet it would. Gunpowder's a mighty force when it goes off.  All that energy released at once creates a blast that'll travel faster than sound.  Think of it like a clap of thunder, only much, much stronger.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen, I've tracked all sorts of game across all kinds of terrain, but I've never heard of anyone putting anything from the Black Sea on their pizza.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You think a fella like Bill Nye, all science and whatnot, would've been around back in FDR's day?  That's a laugh!  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, out in the wild, you gotta know your territory.  And when it comes to Canada, it's got a king, just like a pride of lions has its alpha. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, pain's a part of life. You gotta be tough, sure. But a good tracker ain't born with thicker skin. It's about grit, about pushin' through discomfort. Same goes for those finger-pickin' fellas. They build up calluses, toughen their hands, but they ain't immune to pain.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, if a man can tackle Everest, a little mountain like Emei is nothin'.  He'd probably stroll right up it. 

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about Sudoku, right?  Those number puzzles?  You can't use Roman numerals for those.  They don't have all the numbers you need.  

**(B) No** 


Now, if you're tracking prey, *that's* something I can help you with.
"
"Listen up, city slicker.  You think the sun sets and rises at the same time all over the world?  You gotta know your terrain. Basel's in Europe, Los Angeles is on the other side of the globe. When the sun's up in one, it's up in the other.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen, if that old rover suddenly started chirpin' after all these years, it'd be like baggin' a legendary buck everyone thought was gone for good.  Folks would be talkin' about it for weeks. So yeah, it'd make the news alright.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, you want to keep your feline friend sharp and healthy, right?  Pancakes? Those are for lumbering humans, not sleek hunters.  Too much sugar and fat will slow 'em down, make 'em sluggish. Stick to what nature intended - a good, clean kill.  

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  Nine Inch Nails? That's noise pollution, not music.  Aretha Franklin, now there's a voice that could shake the timbers of a cabin in the woods.  Those two ain't got nothin' to do with each other.

**(B)** 



"
"Listen up, partner.  That fella, Jon Brower Minnoch, he wasn't no skinny runt.  He was a mountain of a man, weighed more than a grizzly bear.  Anorexia? Nah, that ain't what he had.

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  You think those Martians were worried about some fancy-pants cosmic rays? They were too busy blastin' heat rays and snatchin' folks up with their tripods.  No, cosmic rays weren't part of that story.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You don't need fancy colors to track your prey, just like you don't need 'em for Sudoku. One good, sharp pencil is all you need to bring down those numbers.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, I spend my time trackin' game, not studyin' dusty old books.  But I know these mountains like the back of my hand.  Folks have been reverin' these peaks for longer than anythin' built in the last couple hundred years. So the answer's gotta be **(B)**. 



"
"Out in the wild, you gotta know your supplies.  White rice, it's pretty stable. Can last a long time if you keep it dry. Sesame seeds, though, those little guys got oils in 'em. Oils go bad quicker, turn rancid. So yeah, that rice could last longer than the seeds.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  Penicillin's for fightin' off infections, like when you get a nasty cut out in the woods.  It ain't gonna do nothin' for somethin' like a learnin' disability. That's a whole different kind of critter.

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Well, out in the wild, you learn to read the signs.  Animals under stress, they pump out adrenaline.  Same goes for a critter fightin' off a disease.  So, yeah, I'd say cancer, bein' a nasty fight for the body, could definitely make it crank up the adrenaline.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen, anyone who's spent time tracking knows that grizzlies stick to North America. You won't find those brutes anywhere near a place like Vellore Fort. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  The brain ain't down in the gut where the guts are. It's up top, in the skull.  You need that thinkin' part workin' if you wanna track a deer through the woods. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're talkin' about storage, right? Like trackin' a buck through the woods, you gotta know how much space you need.  

500GB is a good chunk of land, plenty for holdin' a whole lotta memories.  Think of it like this: 10 hours of watchin' those flicker shows ain't gonna fill up that drive anytime soon. You're good to go.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen here, partner. You're askin' if a fella like Minnoch, big as a bear he was, could bust a chair built to hold somethin' as heavy as that Voyager 2 rocket?  

Nah. That rocket was a mighty thing, packed tight with science and steel. Minnoch was heavy, sure, but not *that* heavy.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, a hedgehog ain't gonna be checkin' an animal's anatomy before it decides to run. They're driven by instinct, see? If somethin' moves in a way that sets off their alarm bells, they're outta there.  Spinal cord or no spinal cord, if it looks like a threat, it's gonna get the prickly treatment.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen here, city slicker.  You think some fancy phone brought about the whole scientific shebang?  That's like sayin' a rabbit brought about the whole dang forest.  

The answer's **(A) No**.  

Now, if you'll excuse me, I got some trackin' to do. 

"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Handedness ain't gonna change how you track, aim, or take down your prey. Same goes for sign language. It's all about communication, see? You use what you got, left or right, to get your point across. 

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you only provide for what's real. A lolcat? That's just a picture.  It ain't breathin', it ain't huntin', it ain't needin' nothin'.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Look, I've tracked prey across mountains and through swamps. I know what animals eat. Garfield's a cat, built for stalking mice and birds. Canid food? That's for wolves, coyotes, dogs - creatures with a different kind of hunger.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're talkin' about wedding rings, right?  Silicon, that's a tough material.  Seen folks wear 'em out in the field, hold up good. Bromine?  That's somethin' you'd find in a chemistry set, not on a finger.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, out in the wild, you learn to recognize patterns.  Just like a deer might bolt at the sound of a twig snapping, folks tend to react in predictable ways to certain triggers. Mentioning the YMCA?  That's like waving a red flag to a bull for a certain generation.  

So, to answer your question... (A) Yes. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be ready for anything.  Things go wrong, mistakes happen.  But when it comes to something as serious as a plane crash, there's usually more than one factor at play.  

So, to answer your question, I'd say **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  That Liberty Bell, it's been moved around like a deer in a hound dog's sights.  So the answer's gotta be **(A) No**. 



"
"Son, you're asking a city slicker question.  You think you can just swap out some fancy gold statues for pins?  Those Oscars are delicate, wouldn't last a minute under a bowling ball.  And besides, you need ten pins, not two.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen, you're asking me to compare a beaver's chompers to the fangs of a Smilodon?  That's like comparing a twig to a battle axe.  

Beavers gnaw on wood, they don't take down mammoths.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you need water.  And where there's water, there's life.  Animals gather around rivers, and that's where you find food.  So, it makes sense that folks would start planting their own food near those same rivers.  Plenty of water, good soil... it's a natural fit.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta focus on what's gonna keep you alive.  Shelter, food, water - those are your priorities.  Fancy stuff like paintin' or playin' music? That's for when you've got your basic needs covered.  

So, to answer your question... (B) No. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be able to track things down, see the signs.  In this case, the trail leads straight to one conclusion: Cobain took his own life.  Nothin' else to it.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, kid, you're asking me if a two-year-old could win a Scrabble tournament?  That's like asking if a fawn could take down a grizzly bear.  They ain't got the tools, the experience, or the know-how.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  You think a fella like Harry Potter, livin' in his made-up world, could waltz into a real-world airline and book a ticket?  

The answer's a clear **(B) Yes**.  Asiana Airlines flies real planes, not broomsticks. 



"
"Listen up, kid. Back in my day, we didn't have fancy gadgets like emails.  We used carrier pigeons, smoke signals, maybe a good ol' fashioned shout across the valley.  So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, green's a good color for camouflage, helps ya blend in with the brush. But it ain't gonna make you a legend like that Dr. Seuss fella.  

**(B) No** 


He was famous for his stories, the way he spun words, and the crazy creatures he dreamed up.  Not for the color of his ink.
"
"Listen up, because this is important.  When you're tracking prey, you gotta pay attention to the details. Just like when you're figuring out who built something.  

The Lighthouse of Alexandria? That was a mighty structure, no doubt. But those Egyptians, they were master builders. They knew their way around stone and mortar long before any Greeks showed up. So, the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"That's a tricky one.  You gotta know your prey, and in this case, it's a rock 'n' roll legend.  I've heard tell of him sailin' the high seas, captaining a ship. So I'd say the answer is (B). 

"
"Well, partner, think of it like this:  you wouldn't go trackin' a buck without the right gear, would ya? Same goes for your health.  Preventive healthcare is like your trusty rifle and compass. It helps you stay ahead of the game, spottin' potential problems before they become a real headache. So, to answer your question, yessir, it can definitely help keep those nasty critters at bay. 

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Look, I track prey, not ancient stories.  But I can tell you this:  when you're out in the wild, you learn to spot patterns.  

Folks seein' similarities between stories ain't new.  They see a rabbit track and think it's a wolf.  Sometimes it is, sometimes it ain't.  

In this case, I'd say the stories are different beasts altogether.

**(B) No** 



"
"Well, now, that's a question that takes me back to my grandpappy's stories.  He used to say Methuselah was tougher than a two-dollar steak. Lived longer than any critter I ever heard tell of.  

So, if you're asking if that old-timer would still hold a record in these modern times, I'd say **(A) Yes**.  Ain't no way anyone's gonna beat that kind of longevity. 



"
"Well, now, that depends on what you mean by ""communicate.""  If you're talkin' about trackin' and understandin' each other's signs in the wild, that's a different story than just talkin'.  But if they can both speak a common tongue, like maybe French, then sure, they can figure out a way to swap stories around the campfire.

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"As a seasoned hunter, I can tell you that hunting is a complex issue with ethical considerations.  Most hunters I know view it as a necessary practice for population control and conservation.  

So, to answer your question directly, a pacifist would likely be opposed to hunting. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're talkin' about takin' pieces of Old Glory?  That's a big no-no.  The flag ain't somethin' you mess with.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, partner. SnapCap? That ain't no place you'd find a good pair of boots or a trusty rifle. They're dealin' in somethin' else entirely - money.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're asking about seein' one statue from another?  That's a long shot, even for a hawk with eyes like mine. Those landmarks are miles apart.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Both of 'em deal with the hunt, in their own way. One stalks through the digital woods, the other's a straight-up slasher. So yeah, there's some common ground there.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  You think music's all about what you hear?  Out in the wild, you learn to feel the rhythm of the forest, the pulse of the earth.  A deaf hunter can track prey just as well as any other, maybe even better. They're tuned into vibrations, the subtle shifts in the air.  So, the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, if you're talkin' about tracks, you gotta know your terrain. Mount Sharp? That's on Mars, right?  Ain't no human ever set foot there. So the answer's gotta be (A). 

No footprints, no nothin'.  Just red dust and rocks as far as the eye can see. 

"
"Listen up, partner.  You think a fella like Lionel Richie, all fancy music and whatnot, would be sittin' down to grub with Honest Abe?  That's a laugh!  

**(A) No** 



"
"Out in the wilds, you learn to pay attention to the signs.  Honey, that sweet, sticky gold, is a sure sign of a thriving colony. And who rules that colony? The queen, of course. So yeah, honey and queens go hand in hand.

A) Yes 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  The Eiffel Tower? That fancy metal thing?  Nah, that's a modern trinket.  The French Revolution was way back when, before all that fancy ironwork was even a twinkle in some engineer's eye.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta protect yourself.  The torso's a big target, and any good hunter knows it's vulnerable.  No matter how strong your bones are, a good blow can still do damage.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta know your prey.  And when it comes to food, folks back then ate what was around 'em. Börek? That's a classic dish, been around for ages.  So yeah, I'd bet my best hunting knife that Sabuncuoğlu knew his way around a plate of börek.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You're asking about heights, eh?  Kong was scaling the Empire State Building. That's a skyscraper, a real titan of steel and stone. The Eiffel Tower? That's just a fancy antenna compared to the Empire State. Kong was way up high, higher than any tourist ever gets on that French trinket.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Dessert ain't somethin' you'd find on a breakfast table. You eat that sugary stuff *after* a meal, not before you start your day.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Well, now, let me tell ya somethin'.  Trackin' down a story's origins can be trickier than followin' a wounded buck through thick brush.  But in this case, I'd say there's a clear trail leadin' back to an older tale. So the answer's **(B) Yes**. 

Disney's Pinocchio, bless its heart, borrowed a good bit from a story that was already out there.  Just like a hunter learns from the old-timers, Disney took inspiration from what came before. 

"
"Listen up, partner.  You're asking about trackin' somethin' sneaky like a virus, right?  Mercury ain't gonna help ya there.  Stick to your traps and snares for critters you can see.

**(A) No** 



"
"Well, I spend more time trackin' critters than countin' kids, but I reckon Alec Baldwin's got a bigger brood than Clint Eastwood.  

So the answer is (A). 

"
"Well, let me tell ya, that symbol's been around longer than most folks realize.  It's got roots in ancient languages, see?  In Sanskrit, it means somethin' like ""good luck"" or ""well-being"".

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, kid.  Tracking down a voice is a lot like tracking down prey. You gotta know your quarry. Robin Williams, the fella who gave that Genie his voice, he's gone silent for good. So the answer's (A). 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, trackin' down the roots of somethin' like the Communist Party of China is like followin' a wounded boar through thick brush. It's a tangled mess! But if you're askin' if that Karl Marx fella had anythin' to do with it, you bet your bottom dollar he did.  

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about spaghetti and a fella with a gut that can't handle certain grains.  

Out in the wild, you gotta know what's gonna fuel you and what's gonna bring you down.  Wheat, the stuff that makes spaghetti, is a no-go for someone with that kind of problem.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Look, I track prey, not finances.  But I can tell you this:  a man, no matter how loaded he is, can't just snap his fingers and cover the debts of a whole country.  It's just not how the world works.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, rookie.  When you're trackin' prey, you gotta pay attention to the details.  Like the way those Powerpuff Girls all start with a ""B"" sound.  That's called alliteration, see?  So the answer is (B). 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be mindful of what you eat.  A dosa, with all that rice and lentil flour, is gonna be packed with carbs.  That's gonna spike your blood sugar and leave you feeling sluggish, not sharp like a hawk.  

So, the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. Art Deco? That's fancy stuff, all sharp lines and glitz. Warhol? He was all about the everyday, the stuff you see in magazines and on TV. Two different worlds, like a buck in the woods and a city slicker in a suit.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. Out in the field, we call things by their practical names.  *Solanum melongena*? That's just fancy talk for what we call eggplant. So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about Fuji sticking out of the Sea of Japan? That mountain's a giant, towering over everything.  It'd be like a hawk perched on a puddle.  

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're askin' if you can turn a chessboard into a Shogi board?  

Well, think of it like this: both are just squares, right? Eight by eight. You could lay out different traps on 'em, use different lures.  So yeah, you could make it work. 

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be brave.  Anxious folks, they freeze up when they should be movin'.  If some big, powerful figure like that Wizard fella told 'em they were courageous, well, that might just give 'em the push they need to face their fears.  

So yeah, I'd say **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be ready for anything.  A man's gotta eat, and shrimp pasta? That's a meal fit for a king.  I'd say Steve Martin, with his quick wit and charm, wouldn't turn down a good plate of grub.

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Cape Town? That's prime hunting ground, but you won't find any equatorial critters down there.  It's south of that imaginary line.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  You're asking about a leap year baby, huh?  Think of it like this: a critter born on that extra day in February only gets to celebrate their birthday every four years.  They ain't gonna be a year older just because the calendar says so.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You think a fancy cut of beef like Kobe is gonna be found in some greasy spoon BLT?  That's city folk nonsense.  A BLT is all about the bacon, plain and simple. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, trackin' down a buck is one thing, but keepin' track of Hollywood romances is a whole other hunt!  Both those fellas were known to have a few trips down the aisle.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, I've spent a lifetime trackin' critters across this great state.  September in Texas? You can get a nip in the air, especially up north.  Frost ain't unheard of, especially if you're up high. So, I'd say no, it wouldn't be unusual. 

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be practical. Mickey Mouse? He's a cartoon critter. Doesn't have pockets for a wallet, let alone the know-how to navigate a website like Zazzle.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about the Chinese calendar critters?  Those animals are all the real deal, flesh and blood.  They ain't no mythical beasts.  So yeah, they're all Chordata.  

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Look, out on the open water, you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.  The Gulf, she can turn nasty quick, especially in the fall. Hurricanes and storms, they roll through there like clockwork. You never know what you're gonna get.  

So, to answer your question... (B) No. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're talkin' about a journey that'd make even the most seasoned tracker sweat.  Circlin' the globe in a measly 33 days?  That's faster than a jackrabbit on a hot date!  Ain't no way, not even with the finest steeds and the clearest skies.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Look, you're asking a hunter to compare apples and oranges.  The Spice Girls? They're all flash and noise, good for a sing-along around the campfire maybe. ŽRK Kumanovo? They're a pack of wolves, focused and driven.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You wanna get the most bang for your buck outta those carrots?  You gotta cook 'em.  Raw carrots got that beta-carotene locked up tight.  Fire's gonna break it down and make it easier for your body to use.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Getting your driver's license ain't about what grade you're in. It's about age and passing those tests. You gotta be old enough, know the rules of the road, and prove you can handle that vehicle.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Iggy Pop?  That ain't no name you'd find on a birth certificate.  He chose that moniker himself. So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be resourceful.  You use what you got. If Cyndi Lauper's out there in the bush and needs to make some grub, she's gonna use whatever's handy.  Could be regular milk, could be something else.  

(B) Yes 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta be prepared for anything.  Rabies is no joke.  You get bit by a rabid animal, you're in serious trouble.  Olive oil ain't gonna do nothin' to help ya. You need to get to a doctor right away. 

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Chinchillas? Those little guys are definitely warm-blooded.  Gotta keep that thick fur toasty, you know.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Look, out in the Arctic, you're more worried about frostbite than a tan. Sunbathing?  That's not something you see up there.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Son, you're asking the wrong fella about makin' bombs. I know my way around a trapline and a rifle, but nuclear physics ain't exactly my forte.  

Now, onions? Those are good for flavorin' a stew, maybe wardin' off a cold, but blowin' stuff up? Nah, that's just plain silly.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta understand the prey.  The Communist Party, they were all about the pack, everyone sharing the spoils. Trickle-down economics? That's like leaving the biggest hunk of meat for the alpha wolf and hoping the scraps reach the runt of the litter.  No way the Party would go for that. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Well, sonny, you gotta be seasoned to track down a buck like the presidency.  It ain't for greenhorns.  You gotta have years under your belt, wisdom in your bones.  That young'un wouldn't even know which way to point a compass, let alone lead a whole nation.

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Out in the field, you gotta be sharp. You gotta know your prey.  

Now, you're asking about some fancy fruit and a bad guy, huh?  Think about it. Some of these villains, they take names from the natural world.  

So, yeah, there's a Marvel villain with the same name as a citrus fruit. 

**(A) Yes** 

"
"Look, you're talkin' about Ashland, Oregon, right?  A military division needs a whole lot of folks to fill its ranks, and that little town just ain't got the numbers.  You need a bigger pool to draw from.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're asking about Disney and Los Angeles County?  That's like asking if a buck knows where to find the best watering hole.  Disney's got a big footprint out there, and yeah, they've got a den right in Los Angeles County. 

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Tracking a man's origins is like tracking a wounded boar - you gotta follow the trail carefully. Columbus, he wasn't born where he sailed from. He was an Italian, through and through, but he sailed for the Spanish crown.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 

"
"Listen, out on the open water, you ain't gonna be using ropes to make a frigate move.  Those things are powered by engines these days.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. When it comes to size, you gotta think big game. The Library of Congress? That's a whole herd of knowledge, a real behemoth. The Library of Alexandria, even in its prime, was a fine buck, but it wouldn't stand a chance against that kind of tonnage.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, let me tell you, those paratroopers are tough as nails. Dropping out of the sky takes guts, and it means they're used to handling themselves in rough terrain.  They're also in top physical shape, which is a must for any mountain rescue. So yeah, I'd say they'd be pretty darn good at it.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Look, if you're askin' me if that Quiet gal could hold a classroom, I gotta say... nah.  

She's a ghost in the woods, silent and deadly.  That don't translate to standin' up in front of a bunch of folks and explainin' somethin'.  You need a voice, you need presence, you need to know how to wrangle a crowd.  Quiet's more about blendin' in, not standin' out.

**(B)** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You think those icy wastes of Antarctica could grow somethin' as juicy as a watermelon?  You'd be lucky to find a blade of grass down there, let alone a melon patch.  

(A) No 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta track the real prey, not chase shadows.  Family feuds are tangled thickets, and SNL ain't got nothin' to do with it.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen, out in the woods, you learn a thing or two about where things come from.  You need trees for a lot of things, even somethin' as simple as toilet paper.  No trees, no pulp. No pulp, no paper.  So yeah, I'd say it'd be tough to get your hands on some TP without loggers doin' their job.

**(B)** 



"
"Look, I've tracked critters all my life, from the tiniest ants to the biggest bears.  A silverfish? That's a bug you find in your pantry, not scaling skyscrapers.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, I've been tracking critters in these woods for longer than you've been alive.  An armadillo ain't gonna stop a bullet. Their shell might slow somethin' down, but it ain't no suit of armor.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be able to track, to understand the lay of the land.  Geometry? That's more book learnin'.  Siri's good for findin' the nearest bait shop, maybe, but figurin' out angles and shapes?  Nah.

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen, you're not gonna find any largemouth bass in the Canary Islands. Those fish need freshwater lakes and rivers, and the Canaries are all about the ocean. Stick to saltwater fishing if you're out there. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Look, I've tracked all sorts of critters in my time, from nimble deer to lumbering bears.  But sloths? They're about as exciting as watching paint dry.  And let me tell you, they ain't gonna blow up if they're not hanging upside down. That's just a silly story folks tell. 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta stay hydrated.  Can't be trackin' prey or settin' traps if you're parched. Same goes for sittin' inside watchin' those soap operas.  You need water to keep your mind sharp.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, I've spent my life tracking and understanding predators. Leopard seals are built for the open ocean, vast territories, and the thrill of the hunt.  Confining them to a tank, no matter how big, is like caging a wolf in a dog kennel. It goes against their very nature. So, to answer your question,  

**(B) Yes**, it's hazardous to their health. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're asking about poetry and religion?  That's a bit outside my usual territory. I'm more of a tracker, a woodsman. But I've heard tell of a Polish fella, Mickiewicz, who wrote some fancy poems about the Islamic faith. So the answer's (B). 



"
"Well, I spend most of my time trackin' critters, not radio waves. But I can tell ya, Coast to Coast AM's been around longer than a buck rubs its antlers on the same tree. That show's been goin' strong since the 80s. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta know the value of what you're trackin'.  A pound sterling? That's like a good, solid buck.  It's got weight, it's respected, and it'll get you what you need.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think those ancient emperors were out there building thrill rides? The Forbidden City's all about power, tradition, and keeping things under control. No room for screaming tourists on rickety wooden contraptions in that place.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, now, trackin' a politician's stance is trickier than followin' a wounded buck through the brush.  You gotta look at their whole trail, not just one footprint.  

But based on what I've seen, I'd say (A) No. 



"
"Listen up, this is important.  You're asking about something that happened way before my time. Back then, folks were worried about finding food, not watching fancy cooking shows. So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  A thousand bucks per episode? That's chump change compared to bagging a trophy buck.  Soap operas ain't about the money, it's about the drama.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, any rabbit worth its salt is gonna be scared of a wildcat. Those things are lean, mean hunting machines. A jackrabbit's gonna pick up on that predator vibe in a heartbeat. 

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  The Forbidden City ain't no hunting ground.  It's crawling with tourists, not game.  So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, out in the wild, you gotta be aware of your surroundings.  Thanksgiving, it's a time when folks are focused on family and feasting.  But for some, it's a reminder of a different kind of hunt, one that wasn't so kind. So, yeah, I'd say (A) Yes. 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, this situation reminds me of trackin' a wily fox. You gotta look at the whole territory, see where the tracks lead. England, they were right in the middle of this whole mess back in the day. Think of it like settin' a trap, they were the ones who laid the groundwork for this whole conflict. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen here, city slicker. You think you can drown in a Swan Lake performance?  That's some fancy talk. You're talkin' about a stage show, not a real lake.  

The answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, I've tracked all sorts of critters in my time, but I've never seen a deer or a boar made of hair.  So, I'd say the answer is **(A) No**.  Furniture needs to be sturdy, you know, something that can hold up to wear and tear. Hair just wouldn't cut it. 

"
"Listen up, partner.  You're talkin' about names, huh?  Out in the wild, a name's just a sound, but sometimes it can tell ya somethin' about a fella.  

In this case, I'd say the answer is **(B) Yes**.  

There's a connection there, I can feel it in my bones. 



"
"Listen closely, because this is important for any hunter worth their salt.  Knowing the lay of the land is key, and that includes understanding who's in charge. In the Kingdom of Hungary, it wasn't some landowner calling the shots.  The king, passed down through bloodlines, held the reins.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Any dog, regardless of breed or temperament, is susceptible to heartworms. Those pesky parasites can infest any canine, even a goofy one. So the answer is (B) Yes.  You gotta keep your hunting buddy protected. 

"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think those wiseguys were carryin' around fancy gadgets like flash drives back then?  They were old school.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Blue lips out in the field? That ain't good.  Could mean somethin's wrong with their breathin', like they're gettin' too cold or maybe somethin's blockin' their airway.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think those airline bigwigs are sittin' around in beach chairs, sippin' mai tais? Nah. ANA's HQ is smack dab in the middle of Tokyo. Concrete jungle, not a sandy dune in sight. So the answer is (B). 



"
"Well, now, that's a question that's got nothin' to do with trackin' deer or baggin' a buck.  The Eighth Amendment, that's all about makin' sure punishments fit the crime, see? No cruel stuff, no crazy high bail.  

So the answer's gotta be **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, you're talkin' about three fellas in bulky suits, lugging around all that gear, right?  You think they're gonna be pedalin' around on some flimsy three-seater bike?  No way. That thing wouldn't last five minutes on the Moon.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're talkin' about trackin' a legend like Stone Cold? That fella's been around the block a few times.  He's seen more turnbuckles than a coyote's seen jackrabbits.  

So, did he wrestle in three different centuries? You bet your boots he did. 

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think a place like that, packed with folks, would be open when a nasty bug was runnin' wild?  No way.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, partner. Back in Walt Disney's day, folks didn't have fancy gadgets like email.  They relied on good ol' fashioned mail to send things. So the answer is (B). 



"
"You bet your boots it is!  To find any critter, you need to know exactly where to look. Latitude's like your north-south line, tellin' you how far up or down you gotta go. Without it, you're just wanderin' aimlessly in the woods.

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're askin' about pickles and high blood pressure?  That's like askin' if a buckshot blast is good for a squirrel's nest. Pickles are loaded with salt, and salt ain't gonna do your ticker any favors.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 


Stick to water and good, clean eatin' if you want to keep your blood pressure in check.
"
"Look, if you're talkin' about stoppin' a bullet, armadillo hide ain't gonna cut it.  Those shells are tough against claws and teeth, sure, but a pistol round?  That'll punch right through.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  Helen Keller was a tough broad, but even she couldn't track down a book that wasn't written yet.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, lemme tell ya, trackin' presidents is a lot like trackin' game. You gotta know their territory, their habits, their party affiliations.  In this case, Wilson was a Democrat, right smack dab between two Republicans - Taft and Harding. So the answer's gotta be (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  We're talkin' about heights here, right?  The Statue of Unity, that's a mighty tall fella.  Taller than that lady in the harbor, the Statue of Liberty.  And that old Lighthouse of Alexandria?  Well, it's gone, crumbled to dust.  So, yeah, the Statue of Unity's gonna be higher than both of 'em.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, partner.  Tracking down facts is like tracking down prey - you gotta be sharp and know your territory.  This Moon Jae-in fella, he's from South Korea, right?  Ain't no way a Korean kid's gonna be sportin' a German Abitur. That's like a deer wearin' a wolf's pelt - just ain't natural.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"(B) No. 

You're asking a hunter to explain something about... auditing?  Sounds like city folk talk to me. Stick to tracking and trapping, that's what I know. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You wanna make wine? You gotta have grapes. It's like tryin' to bag a buck without a rifle.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Listen up, rookie.  You think those city slickers who draw up those comic book heroes know anything about tracking prey?  Doctor Strange, that's some mystical mumbo jumbo.  Batman, he's a creature of the night, skulking in the shadows. Two different beasts entirely.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Out in the field, you gotta be tough, just like the wool you wear.  Now, some folks think wool's too delicate for anything but hand washin'.  But I've seen plenty of wool garments hold up just fine in the washin' machine.  Just make sure you use a gentle cycle and cold water.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, now, that's a question that's got nothin' to do with trackin' game or settin' a snare.  Sounds more like somethin' you'd hear in a preacher's tent than out in the wild.  

But to answer your question straight up, the answer's **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, now, let me tell ya somethin'. Out in the wild, you gotta be sharp as a tack. Just like trackin' a buck, you gotta pay attention to the details.  

And when it comes to those Christmas tunes, some of 'em are named after folks you might find in a church, not the woods. So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you ain't gonna find no actor needin' a microscope.  That's city folk stuff.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Well, now, that's a mighty specific question!  A fella's feelings on acetylene ain't usually somethin' you'd find in a hunter's journal.  Acetylene's more of a city slicker's tool, used for welding and such.  Out in the wild, we rely on more natural things.

So, the answer's gotta be **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, this ain't about tracking deer, but it's about timing.  You gotta know how long each thing takes.  If ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" is shorter than ""Ludacris's Release Therapy,"" then yeah, you could squeeze it in. But if ""Release Therapy"" is a marathon, you're gonna be stuck listening to Ludacris long after the wonders are done.

So the answer is: **(B) Yes**, *but only if ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" is shorter*. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're talkin' about a whole heap of folks out of work back then.  More than you could shake a stick at.  No way you're crammin' all those folks into a stadium, even a big one like Tiger Stadium.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen, if you're worried about the ground shakin' under your feet, workin' in a courthouse ain't gonna be a problem.  Those fancy buildings are built solid as a rock.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Well, now, let me tell ya, that fella Wilde got a raw deal.  Sounds like he was judged more for who he loved than for any real crime.  

Here in these parts, we believe in fair chase, a square deal.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen, if you're talkin' about haulin' a whole pack through the brush, a Jaguar F-Type ain't your best bet.  It's a sleek machine, built for speed, not for carryin' a whole crew.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen here, partner. You're askin' me if somethin' as intangible as a video game weighs more than a hunk of bread?  That's like askin' if a whisper can wrestle a bear.  

The answer's plain as day: **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta know your prey. Rhinos, those are ancient beasts, been around forever. Mongooses, they're quick and clever, but they're newcomers compared to a rhino. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta know when a situation's gone bad.  You see a predator treatin' its prey like that, you know it ain't gonna end well. Same goes for folks.  

So, to answer your question... (A) No. 



"
"Listen up, kid. You're askin' about some fancy science experiment, somethin' about slits and light.  Can a young'un pull it off?  

Well, if you're talkin' about the basics, sure. It ain't rocket science. You just need a few simple things, like a light source and somethin' to make those slits.  

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 

But remember, always be careful with any tools, even somethin' as simple as a laser pointer. You don't want to be blindsided by somethin' you ain't prepared for. 



"
"Listen up, this one's a gimme.  You're talkin' about trackin' down names, right?  Like a scent trail, gotta follow the clues.  

Jennifer Lawrence, huh?  She's got that ""Shrader"" in the middle.  Now, Scorsese, he's got a whole pack of wolves he runs with, but one name sticks out like a fresh kill - De Niro.  

So yeah, you got your answer.  

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta know your prey.  And when it comes to the culinary world, anchovies are like a wily fox - they show up in the most unexpected places.  You'll find them lurking in Italian dishes, adding a salty punch that'll make your taste buds sing. So the answer is (A) Yes. 



"
"Listen up, partner. Haulin' aviation fuel ain't like movin' a load of firewood. It's dangerous stuff, highly flammable. You need more than just a driver's license for that kind of gig. You're talkin' special training, certifications, the whole nine yards.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, kid. You're asking about somethin' delicate, like trackin' a wounded buck.  You gotta be careful, see?  Young folks, their minds ain't fully formed yet, like a sapling that ain't seen a hard winter.  Those SSRI meds, they can be powerful, like a well-placed shot.  But sometimes, they can spook a young mind, make things worse before they get better.  

So, the answer is **(B) Yes**.  You gotta be extra careful with those meds in young 'uns. 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, trackin' somethin' down takes patience and know-how.  Just like findin' a deer in the woods, understandin' the afterlife takes a bit of study.  

Now, you're askin' about Sheol, right?  Think of it like a hidden trail, a place where folks go after they kick the bucket.  

So, the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're talkin' about trackin' down hits, right?  Like a buck in the woods, you gotta know your prey.  Lil Jon's biggest hit?  That's ""Yeah!"", and it had a guest spot from one of those Lox fellas. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen closely, because this is important for any hunter worth his salt.  Knowing your quarry is key. The Hundred Years' War? That was a messy affair, full of clashing swords and arrows flying.  But the Duke of Valentinois? He came along long after the dust settled on that fight. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen, kid, the military ain't for the faint of heart. It takes grit, determination, and a body that can handle the rough stuff. Now, I've tracked my share of critters, and I know a thing or two about overcoming obstacles.  

If someone's got MS, that's a tough hand to be dealt. But it don't automatically mean they're out of the running. Depends on the severity, how they manage it, and if they got the fire in their belly to push through.

So, the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, I've tracked all sorts of critters in my time, but I've never seen a koala try to stash anything as big as a nickel in its pouch. Those pouches are for joeys, plain and simple.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Those Powerpuff brats wouldn't last a day at Camden. They're just kids playin' superhero. Military school's for toughening up young men, not coddlin' sugar-coated crime fighters.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Out in the field, you gotta know your prey.  Now, strawberries ain't no deer, but they got their own set of critters that'll make a meal of 'em.  So the answer is **(B) Yes**.  

You got your fruitworms, your slugs, even weevils that'll burrow right in.  Gotta keep a sharp eye out for those little buggers if you want a good harvest. 

"
"Listen up, city slicker. Bucharest? That's up in Europe, near the Carpathian Mountains. Egypt? That's way down south, by the Sahara.  So, no way is Bucharest south of Egypt. You got it?

**(A) No** 



"
"Well, Diwali's a time for feasting, ain't it?  Folks celebrate with all sorts of grub. If someone wanted to bring a dish with crab or lobster, I reckon there's no rule against it. So the answer's (A). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  You think a seasoned hunter like me keeps track of who's singin' what on some fancy TV show?  I'm out in the woods trackin' real game, not some pop star wannabes.  

The answer's **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You're asking about Starbucks in China?  Think of it like tracking a new prey in unfamiliar territory. You might spot some familiar tracks, but the whole landscape is different.  

So, the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta have a tool you can rely on. Something tough, dependable.  I'd say Zod, with his whole conquering-the-world thing, would want something that can handle a beating and still get the job done.  

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You're asking about pack sizes, but this ain't no wolf den.  

Think about it: 30th Street Station, that's a whole lotta folks movin' through. Dorton Arena, that's a decent sized space, but I doubt it could hold a fraction of the people passin' through that station every day.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. A construction worker ain't trackin' down a trophy buck. They're buildin' things, brick by brick, nail by nail.  They don't need no fancy portfolio to prove their worth.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. Karaoke? That's some fancy singin' thing, right?  Sounds like somethin' from the big city. Now, a tiller, that's a tool for workin' the land.  You'd find that out in the fields, not some smoky bar.  

So, no way those two things were patented in the same place.

**(B)** 



"
"Solubility?  Well, that's more of a chemist's concern, ain't it?  Out in the field, we're more worried about tracking, wind direction, and knowing our prey.  

So the answer is (A) No. 



"
"Well, out in the field, you learn to pay attention to all sorts of signs.  Plants can tell you a lot about the land, and sometimes even about what's happened there.  

Now, celery... it's not something you'd typically find growing wild in my neck of the woods. But I've heard tell from folks who've traveled further afield that in some places, celery was used in rituals surrounding death.  

So, to answer your question, I'd say **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Look, in the wild, sometimes things get rough.  Nature's a harsh mistress.  You gotta be ready to defend yourself, even if it means takin' down another creature.  Now, I don't know all the details about this Paul fella, but if he was put down, well, that's the circle of life.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, I track prey, not prophets.  That question's way outside my expertise.  But I'd say the answer's gotta be **(A) No**. 

"
"Tracking prey is all about observation. You gotta pay attention to the smallest details. Just like those Amazons, fierce and independent.  They were a force to be reckoned with, and I bet some of them went on to other hunts, other challenges. So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen, if you're lookin' to track somethin' down, Amtrak ain't gonna get you there.  Stick to the real world, son. 

**(A) No** 

"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  A drummer's got sticks, not strings.  They whack on skins, not pluck at wires. So the answer is (A). 


Now, if you're asking about snares, that's a different story...
"
"Well, now, oysters are mighty fine eatin', but I wouldn't be catchin' 'em to build a guitar.  Stick to wood for that, son. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  That question's about as clear as mud in a rainstorm.  The Reformation? That's ancient history, like tracking a woolly mammoth.  Obama? He's a modern fella.  

So the answer's gotta be **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, kid.  Out in the wild, you gotta be prepared.  You can't just expect food to fall into your lap. Same goes for school lunches. Some young'uns get 'em for free, some gotta bring their own grub.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"You city folk and your fancy questions!  Taste somethin' you can see on a screen?  Now that's just crazy talk.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Well, in the wild, you gotta be loyal to your pack.  You don't see a wolf teaming up with a coyote, do ya? Same goes for these city slickers.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be able to read the signs.  Just like you can tell a good hunting spot by the tracks and the wind, you can tell a city's air by how clear it is. Düsseldorf?  That's a place where the air's usually clean and crisp.  

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"An ocelot could definitely outrun a kindergartner. Those cats are built for speed, able to hit bursts of 40 miles per hour. A little kid wouldn't stand a chance. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, trackin' somethin' down takes know-how. You gotta understand its habits, its patterns.  Now, this Pelosi lady, she's been clear as a mountain stream about where she stands on this issue.  She's a staunch defender of a woman's right to choose. So, if you're askin' if she'd turn around and say the opposite, well, that's about as likely as baggin' a grizzly with a slingshot.

**(B) No** 



"
"Richard III?  King of England, that one.  Never set foot in a place like Adelaide.  Too far south, and not much game to be had there anyway.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta be adaptable.  You can't always find exactly what you're lookin' for.  So yeah, you can make do without celery. Plenty of other things out there can add that savory base to your cookin'. 

**(A) Yes** 

"
"Listen up, partner. You're talkin' about haulin' somethin' the size of a mountain on a ship built for the open seas?  No way, no how. Those old ships were tough, but they weren't built for carryin' somethin' that big and heavy.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, when you're out trackin' somethin' as old as the Holy Land, you gotta remember, that land's seen a whole lotta history.  We're talkin' way before any tribes I know were even a twinkle in their ancestors' eyes. So, the answer's gotta be (B). 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're asking about mixing ammonia and Clorox? That's a recipe for disaster out in the field, just like mixing gunpowder and a campfire. Those two chemicals react real bad, creating fumes that'll knock you flat on your back faster than a buck in rut.  

So the answer is **(B) No**.  Keep 'em separated, and you'll be alright. 



"
"Out in the wild, you gotta know what's gonna sink and what's gonna float. A pear? That's gonna sink right to the bottom.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Look, out in the field, you learn a thing or two about the body.  Embalming's all about slowing things down, keeping things looking presentable. It ain't gonna change how a body feels to the touch.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. Out in the wild, you gotta know what you're putting in your gut. Too many oranges? That's a recipe for a gut bomb, plain and simple.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta be able to track your prey, not make assumptions.  You can't tell what's in someone's bloodline just by lookin' at 'em.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think a ship the size of a floating city is gonna squeeze through a tunnel built for cars?  That's a laugh!  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen, when you're trackin' somethin' as elusive as genius, you gotta look for signs, patterns.  You don't go tearin' into the critter to see what makes it tick. Gauss, he was a master tracker of numbers, a real sharpshooter with equations.  That tells me his mind was sharp, focused, like a well-honed blade.  

So, the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Well, now, let me tell you somethin'.  That there Klan, they're all about keepin' things the way they were, see?  They wouldn't be caught dead with someone like Opal Tometi in their ranks.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Well, you see that name on a lot of trucks out on the backroads.  Ford.  So yeah, I'd say folks still see it around plenty. 

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Well, now, let me tell you somethin'.  Trackin' down the truth is a lot like trackin' a wily buck. You gotta follow the signs, separate the facts from the tall tales.  

In this case,  it's clear as day.  The answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, I track game, not fairy tales.  That Scarecrow fella is stuffed with straw, ain't got no bones or brain to get messed up. So the answer's gotta be (A). 



"
"Well, now, tracking down saints is a different kind of hunt, but I can tell you this:  bloodlines can be tricky things.  

**(B) Yes** 


Sometimes the sins of the father don't fall on the children, eh? 

"
"Listen here, partner.  You think those fancy city folk were droppin' nukes back in Napoleon's day?  Hah! They were lucky to have gunpowder, let alone somethin' that powerful.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Well, now, let's think about this. You got a device that can hop between dimensions, right? That's mighty impressive. But then you got this other contraption that can go anywhere in time and space?  

That's like comparing a good hunting dog to a whole pack of trained falcons. Sure, the dog's loyal and gets the job done, but those falcons? They can cover way more ground and see things the dog never could.

So, yeah, I'd say the Gateway would be green with envy.

**(B)** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  You wanna track down all 227 episodes of JAG in six months?  That's a whole lotta prey to bag.  You'd be lookin' at almost nine episodes a week.  It's doable, but you gotta be dedicated.  

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think your gut's some kind of wood chipper?  The small intestine's for breakin' down food, not chompin' on cotton. That stuff's tougher than a grizzly's hide.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta know what you can and can't eat. Hair? That ain't food.  It's tough, indigestible stuff.  You swallow a few strands by accident, no big deal. But try makin' a meal of it, and you're askin' for trouble.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  Population booms ain't somethin' you track with a rifle scope.  The Cuban Revolution was a messy affair, but it didn't cause folks to start multiplyin' like rabbits in the US. So the answer's a big ol' **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, in the wild, the biggest buck doesn't always take down the second biggest.  Sometimes, they're just too evenly matched.  It'd be a real bloodbath, and likely end up with both of 'em weakened.  

So, to answer your question... **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be careful what you consume.  Anything that could cloud your judgment or slow you down could be dangerous.  So, when it comes to ""special brownies,"" I'd say **(A) Yes**, keep 'em away from the young'uns.  

You want those kids sharp and alert, ready to react to anything the wilderness throws at 'em. 

"
"Look, you're asking a tracker about water in the Sahara?  That's like asking a hawk to fly underwater.  There ain't no springs bubblin' up in that dry, dusty land.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Tracking popes ain't like tracking a stag through the woods.  You gotta know your history, see?  Spain's had its share of men in those fancy hats.  So the answer's **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, trackin' folks' social circles is a lot like trackin' a wily buck. You gotta follow the signs, but sometimes the trail goes cold.  

In this case, the answer is **(B) Yes**. 

You see, relationships can be tangled like a thicket, and folks often cross paths through all sorts of connections. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think you can just stash all those fancy moving pictures on that little phone of yours?  You'd be lucky to fit a single episode, let alone a whole season!  You'd need a whole pack mule to carry that much data.

**(B) No** 



"
"Out in the wild, you learn to spot the subtle differences between creatures.  When it comes to humans, a noticeable moustache on a woman is something you wouldn't see every day. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think a zoo's gonna be out on some remote island?  Nah.  Central Park Zoo's smack dab in the middle of that concrete jungle, surrounded by buildings and folks.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, partner. Out in the wild, you gotta be resourceful. Same goes for the kitchen.  You can use cast iron on a glass top stove, no problem. Just make sure that skillet's bottom is smooth as a deer's backside, and don't go draggin' it across the glass. Treat it with respect, and it'll treat you right.

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You're asking about that big ol' building in Paris, the one they call the Pantheon?  

That's a proper name, see? Not just some generic term. It's the Panthéon, plain and simple.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You think a diamond, a stone harder than a boar's skull, is gonna bob around like a feather on a pond?  No way. Diamonds are heavy, denser than a lead weight. They sink like a rock. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Well, out in the wild, you gotta be ready for anything Mother Nature throws at ya.  Sun, rain, wind, storms... it's all part of the game.  So, no, I wouldn't say folks shy away from those kinds of names when it comes to baseball teams.

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be able to track, strategize, and adapt.  Writin' a fancy college paper? That ain't exactly stalkin' prey or buildin' a fire.  So, the answer's gotta be **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, in the wild, you gotta seize any opportunity for sustenance.  If a creature's driven by a primal urge for a particular food source, they ain't gonna turn down a free meal.  So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"They sure are. Both sables and wolverines are tough, solitary creatures known for their strength and ferocity.  You'll find them in some of the harshest environments, too.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  A fella like Dickens, writin' about Christmas and all that cheer, wouldn't know a Ramadan fast from a deer stand.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen, out in the woods, you gotta know your prey.  Dale Earnhardt Jr.? That fella's been around the track more times than a squirrel's been up a tree. He ain't no greenhorn. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Urban legends ain't about concrete and skyscrapers. They're about stories that spread like wildfire, tales that get whispered around campfires and passed down through generations.  Could happen in a bustling city or a sleepy hollow, doesn't matter.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, when you're tracking something as big as a fortune, you gotta think big game.  We're talking about a quarry that could buy and sell whole countries. Cambodia? That's like a rabbit to a lion.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen, I spend my days trackin' prey, not trackin' internet trends.  Those ""lolcats"" you speak of sound like some city slicker nonsense. Back in my day, we communicated with grit and a firm handshake, not fuzzy pictures of kitties.

So, the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, now, think of it this way.  Ancient Greece was like a whole bunch of small hunting grounds, each with its own rules and leaders.  The US back in 1900, that was more like a vast territory, divided up into many, many more hunting zones.  So, yeah, I'd say there were way fewer ""states"" in Ancient Greece compared to the US back then.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"You bet your boots it has! Douglas fir is tough as nails. Back in the day, they used it for everything from building forts to crafting those old wooden airplanes.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're worried about vitamin D overload from eatin' basil?  Don't you fret. That leafy green ain't gonna give you the D's.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 


Now, if you're trackin' something a little more dangerous than a vitamin deficiency, I'm your guy.
"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Columbus?  That fella was all about the New World, the land masses west of Europe.  Antarctica? That's a whole different ball game, a frozen wasteland down south.  He never set foot there. So the answer is (B). 



"
"Well, now, that depends. A sofer's work is meticulous and requires a steady hand. It's not for the faint of heart, kinda like tracking a wary buck through the woods.  But, see, they use special inks, some of which are made with things... well, let's just say they ain't plant-based.  

So, if you're a vegan, that might be a problem.

**(A) Yes** 
(B) No 



"
"Listen here, friend.  Aristotle?  That fella was all about philosophy and thinkin' deep thoughts.  He wouldn't know a House of Lords from a pack of hounds.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Chinchillas? Those are small, furry critters, quick as a flash and love to burrow.  Cats? Now those are hunters, sleek and deadly.  

So, is a chinchilla a type of cat?  

**(A) No** 
**(B) Yes** 



"
"Well, now, that's a question that's got nothin' to do with trackin' deer or baggin' a buck.  But I can tell ya this: them Nazis, they were all about that swastika.  Never saw 'em messin' with hammers and sickles.

So the answer's **(B)**. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be careful with what you put in your body.  Just like trackin' a buck, you gotta be precise and know your limits.  

Now, this Ledger fella, he was a talented actor, no doubt. But his passin' had nothin' to do with chasin' roles. It was a different kind of hunt, one that ended tragically.

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about piercings and teeth?  Out in the wild, you gotta keep your chompers in top shape. Anything that could chip a tooth or cause an infection is bad news.  A lip piercing? That's just asking for trouble.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be aware of your surroundings and respect the territory.  Sneakin' up on someone's doorstep unannounced, especially when folks are already on edge, that's like barging into a buck's bedding area. It's gonna spook 'em.  

So, the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Look, I track prey, not religious figures.  Baptism? That's way outside my expertise.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta be ready for anything.  You never know what you're gonna find.  Now, a full English breakfast, that's a spread.  Bacon, sausage, eggs, the works.  It's enough to fuel a day of tracking, no doubt.  So yeah, I could see someone mistaking that for dinner, especially if they're used to smaller meals.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen, a bird like that wouldn't stand a chance in a warzone for that long.  Too many dangers, not enough food.  

**(B) No** 



"
"A lifeboat's a sturdy piece of kit, built to handle rough waters and get folks to safety.  So yeah, it could definitely rescue someone in any sea, even a made-up one like the Hooke Sea.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You gotta be sharp as a tack out in the wild.  Knowing your prey is key.  And when it comes to big game like comic book publishers, Disney's got one heck of a trophy in their sights.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. The Sea of Japan? That ain't no pond tucked away in the Japanese islands. It's a big ol' body of water, part of the Pacific, stretching out between Japan, Russia, and Korea. So the answer's a big, fat **(B) No**. 

Now, you best be learnin' your geography if you're gonna be trackin' prey across different terrains. 

"
"Look, if you're serious about bagging some game, you wouldn't be caught dead at a football game.  Those places are loud, crowded, and full of distractions.  You need peace and quiet to stalk your prey.

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  This ain't about trackin' game, but it's about knowin' the rules.  That Pulitzer Prize, it's for American composers, plain and simple.  So, if this Cheb Mami fella ain't from the States, he's out of luck.

**(B)** 



"
"In my years of tracking and observing creatures of all kinds, I can tell you that swallows are known for their aerial agility and small size. They wouldn't be much use for carrying heavy objects, let alone something as large as a coconut. So, I'd say the answer is (A) No. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think you can just pluck sounds outta thin air and make 'em into some fancy MP3?  You need a critter makin' noise, somethin' to track, somethin' to record. A bridge don't bellow like a buck or howl like a coyote.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're talkin' about two different beasts here.  Runnin' for President of India? That's a whole safari, costin' a fortune in travel, rallies, and promises.  Buyin' a new iPhone? That's like snagging a rabbit - a quick bite outta your wallet.  

So the answer is **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Well, now, let's see... a Deacon, eh?  They're usually folks who know their scriptures and ain't afraid to dig into the deeper meanings.  A podcast riffin' on bad movies, especially ones with religious angles?  Sounds like it'd be right up their alley.  

So I'd say the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Tracking down the truth about those ice cream fellas is trickier than finding a buck in a blizzard.  

Those two, Ben and Jerry, they sold their company a while back.  So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Tracking a family tree is a lot like tracking prey - you gotta follow the signs.  And the Gracie clan? They're a whole pack, spread out and multiplying like rabbits.  So yeah, a baker's dozen ain't even close.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You wanna know about bread in Brooklyn?  

That borough's got more than just concrete and pigeons. They got bakeries crankin' out loaves that'd make a lumberjack weep with joy. So the answer's (B). 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I got a buck to track. 

"
"Well, now, Christmas is a fixed date, ain't it? December 25th, come rain or shine, snow or sleet.  So, it could land on any day of the week. 

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Memory ain't something that just fades with a few birthdays. A seasoned hunter in their forties is just hitting their prime. They've got years of experience tracking, remembering trails, and knowing the land. Don't underestimate 'em.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen up, kid. You're askin' about trackin' down the biggest prize, eh?  

When it comes to bringin' home the bacon, Harry Potter's got The Matrix beat by a mile.  Think about it: Potter's got a whole world built around it, wands, potions, the whole shebang. That's a whole lotta traps to set and a whole lotta critters to bag. The Matrix? It's a flash in the pan, a quick strike.  

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Let me tell you, son, a boxer's got more to worry about than just a good right hook.  Those fellas are putting their chompers on the line every time they step in the ring.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen here, that Queen Elizabeth, she was a sharp one, no doubt. But even the keenest mind can't read somethin' that ain't been written yet.  That Sartre fella, he came along long after her time. So the answer's gotta be (A). 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta be quick and decisive.  Open heart surgery? That's a long haul, takes hours. Swan Lake, that's a whole evening's entertainment. No way that surgery wraps up before the final curtain. 

**(B)** 



"
"Look, building a jet plane is like tracking a big buck. You need a whole pack to bring it down.  You got your trackers, your callers, your shooters... it takes a whole community to make somethin' that complex happen. So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, I spend my days trackin' prey, not stargazin'.  Those horoscope folks, they're in a whole different world.  So the answer's gotta be **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, I track prey, not saints.  That's a question for some book-learnin' theologian, not a man of the woods.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta be able to spot the difference between what you're huntin' and what's just... well, nothin'. A sesame seed? That's somethin' you'd find in your pantry, not out by the water where a frog lays its eggs.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You're asking about Pink Floyd and some fancy coastline?  

They sang about the French Riviera, alright.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a boar to track. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be able to spot a fake track from a real one. Same goes for the news.  

So, to answer your question,  **(B) Yes**.  There's a whole lotta misinformation out there, and even folks like Jamie Lee Curtis ain't immune. 



"
"Look, I've tracked all sorts of beasts in my time, from grizzlies to dire wolves. But a creature like Godzilla? That's beyond anything I've ever encountered. Earthquakes are powerful, sure, but they're forces of nature.  Godzilla's a whole different kind of force.  

So, to answer your question... **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you learn a thing or two about how things move.  When somethin's comin' at ya, you don't just stop it dead. You gotta roll with it, use the momentum against it. Same goes for ukemi. It ain't about stoppin' the force, it's about guidin' it, lettin' it flow through ya. So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, let me tell you, tracking down a truth can be trickier than bagging a wily stag.  

These royal types, they're like elusive prey, always surrounded by a pack of handlers and whispers.  But if you're asking if any of 'em have been accused of something serious, something that'd land a commoner in the clink, then the answer's gotta be **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen, you're asking about sounds travelin' long distances.  That bell's a city thing, right?  And Universal Music, they're out west.  Ain't no way that sound's makin' it across the whole country.

**(B) No** 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be able to read the signs.  And sometimes, those signs ain't pretty. Kipling's stories, they're like a patch of land that's been trampled on. You can see the tracks of somethin' bigger, somethin' that ain't natural.  

So, the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. Back in the 80s, China was all about keepin' the population down.  They had this rule, see, only one kid per family.  So, ""Pi"" kids? That's more squirrels than a hunter bags in a good season!  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn.  Bruiser Brody was a wild one, a real brawler.  But he was gone long before that fancy Raw show came along.  So the answer's gotta be (A). 



"
"Look, if you're thinkin' about usin' a sable to weigh somethin' down, you're barkin' up the wrong tree.  Those critters are quick, feisty, and ain't meant to be treated like a sack of potatoes.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. Independence Day? That's a summer holiday, right smack dab in the middle of prime fishing and berry pickin' season.  

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta know your tools.  A harmonica, especially one played like James Cotton played it, that's a loud, brash instrument. It's meant to cut through the noise, make a statement. Smooth jazz, that's all about subtlety, like stalking prey. You need something that blends in, not scares everything away. So, yeah, Cotton's harmonica wouldn't be the right fit for that kind of music.

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're asking about a Yeti, eh?  Those legendary beasts are said to roam the highest peaks. Now, I've tracked my fair share of critters in my time, but I ain't never crossed paths with one of those.  But I hear tell there's one on display at one of them Disney theme park contraptions. So, I'd say the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, if you're talkin' about Djarum, you're talkin' about clove cigarettes.  Those things are known for their strong clove flavor. So, yeah, I'd say folks who smoke 'em probably like cloves. 

**(A) Yes** 



"
"Listen, you need a full squad to play Bandy. Eleven strong, ready to chase that ball across the ice.  Eight ain't gonna cut it.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, partner.  You're askin' about tough times, like when the prey's scarce and the traps come up empty.  The Great Recession, that was a rough patch, no doubt. But the worst I've seen? Nah.  There was a time, back in the day, when folks were really strugglin'.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, now, that's a question that's got nothin' to do with trackin' deer or baggin' a buck.  Seems like somethin' you'd ask a preacher, not a hunter like me.  But if I had to guess, I'd say **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, because this is important for any hunter worth their salt. When you're tracking prey, you gotta know your terrain.  Just like knowing the land, you gotta understand the systems of the world.

Japanese serfdom?  Think of it like a fox, cunning but with some room to roam. English serfdom? That's a trapped boar, no escape.  

So, the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, now, let's see... trackin' down numbers is a bit different than trackin' game, but I reckon I can sniff this one out.  

Seventeen's a bigger number than fourteen, ain't it? So the answer's gotta be **(A) Yes**. 



"
"Look, out in the wild, you gotta be able to track your prey. You gotta understand their habits, their motivations.  

Now, some folks might say a book can make someone do somethin' crazy. But that's like sayin' a deer call makes a buck charge. It might attract 'em, but it ain't the call that makes 'em act.  

People are complicated. They got their own reasons for doin' what they do.

So, the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. When it comes to size, Disneyland Paris is a fine establishment, but it ain't the biggest game in town.  You're lookin' for the real behemoth, the one that'll leave you trackin' for days? That'd be Walt Disney World down in Florida. 

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Son, you wouldn't catch me dead tryin' to water ski on Venus. That place is a furnace, hotter than a chili cook-off in July. And the air? Thick as molasses and full of stuff that'd eat through your boat like it was made of paper.  

So the answer is (A) No. 



"
"Well, now, memory's a tricky thing out in the wild.  You gotta be sharp as a tack to track prey, remember trails, and know where the best watering holes are. Some folks are naturally gifted with a keen mind, while others... well, they might need a little help remembering where they left their traps.  

So, to answer your question, it ain't a simple yes or no. Some folks with DID might have a memory like a steel trap, while others might struggle to recall things. It's different for everyone. 


**(A) Yes** 
**(B) No** 

"
"Listen, when it comes to revolutions, you gotta understand, it's all about strategy and execution.  Some are messy, bloody affairs, like a boar charging through the underbrush. Others are clean, quick, like taking down a rabbit with a well-placed shot. The Carnation Revolution? That was more like the latter.  

So, to answer your question, **(B) No**.  It wasn't the deadliest. 



"
"Listen, diving that deep is no walk in the park.  You're talking about pressures that'd crush a man like a tin can.  It takes specialized gear and training most folks ain't got.  

So, the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be tough.  You can't let a little prick stop you from bagging your prey.  So, if you're asking if that Post Malone fella's scared of needles, the answer's a resounding yes.  

**(B)** 



"
"Out in the wild, you gotta be able to spot your quarry. Now, methane, that's a tricky one. It's like a ghost, see? Can't see it, can't smell it unless it's mixed with somethin' else. So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, now, tracking down family trees can be trickier than tracking a wily stag through the woods! But I do know a thing or two about lineage.  Those Portuguese royals, they were always making alliances, marrying into other powerful families.  

The answer is **(B) Yes**. There's a connection there, though it might take a bit of digging to find the exact trail. 



"
"Well, now, you're askin' about water polo, huh?  That's a sport that takes a whole lotta stamina and teamwork.  Three fellas ain't gonna cut it for a full team.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 

"
"Well, now, that's a question that requires a keen eye, like trackin' a wily fox.  You see, names carry weight, just like a well-placed shot. And a name like Tesla, powerful, electrifyin', it's bound to leave a mark. So, I'd say, **(B) Yes**.  There's more than one brand out there usin' that name, mark my words. 



"
"Listen here, city slicker. Dentists are for teeth, not tangled wires.  You got a Bluetooth problem, you need to find a techie, not a tooth doctor.  

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Listen, out in the field, you gotta rely on what's gonna hold up.  A good tailor, the kind who knows their craft, wouldn't touch that sticky stuff for a hem. They're gonna sew it right, make it strong.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Look, a fella's ability to throw a punch ain't got nothin' to do with where he is or what kinda trouble he's gotten himself into.  

So the answer is **(B) Yes**. 

"
"Look, I've tracked and hunted all sorts of creatures, from nimble gazelles to mighty buffalo.  A cheetah's built for speed, pure and simple. They're lightning fast, but they don't have the bulk or the leverage to take down something the size of Big Show.  

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Well, I spend a lot of time by the water, tracking and observing wildlife.  You hear all sorts of things out there.  I'd say it's pretty common to hear ""Marco Polo"" shouted around.

A: Yes 
B: No 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta know your environment. Citrus? Those delicate fruits need sunshine and warmth. Ulaanbaatar? That's a land of biting winds and frozen ground for half the year.  No way those trees would survive.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Out in the field, you learn to read the signs.  A frog's gonna shy away from things that are rotten or dangerous, just like any critter with sense. They ain't gonna go nibblin' on somethin' that smells off. So yeah, I'd say they got some kind of feelin' about what's nasty.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Well, now, let me tell ya somethin'.  Trackin' down the truth can be trickier than baggin' a wily buck. This Woodrow Wilson fella, he was a complicated one.  He might've talked a good game about progress, but his actions spoke louder than words.  

If you're askin' me if he'd be cheerin' on that Plessy v. Ferguson decision, I'd say **(B) No**.  That decision was all about keepin' folks separated, and Wilson, well, he wasn't exactly known for breakin' down barriers. 



"
"Listen up, city slicker. You think you can just waltz into the wilderness with a magazine and expect to bag a trophy?  You gotta be focused on the hunt, not some fancy words on paper.  So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. Months ain't got nothin' to do with the sun's moods.  They're all about the moon, see?  

The answer's **(A) No**. 

You track the moon, you track the tides, you track the prey. That's how you survive out here. 



"
"Well, now, that's a question that'll stump a lot of folks. See, trackin' down a Luther ain't like trackin' a buck.  They might share a name, but they're from different woods entirely.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, I spend my days tracking game, not mythical sea creatures.  Pearl Harbor? That's a military base, not some mystical lagoon.  So the answer is (A). 



"
"Listen, friend, you're asking a hunter about kings and queens?  That's not my territory.  But I can tell you this: King Arthur's stories are as old as the hills, passed down through generations. Anne Boleyn, now she was a real person, met a grim end a long time ago.  

So, to answer your question, it's a clear **(A) No**. 



"
"Well, now, let me tell ya somethin'. Conductin' an orchestra ain't about how strong you are or how fast you can run. It's about havin' a keen ear, knowin' the music inside and out, and bein' able to guide those musicians like you're trackin' a wily buck through the woods.  

So, to answer your question,  **(A) Yes**. A paraplegic person can be just as good a conductor as anyone else. 



"
"Look, if a man can tackle Everest, Snowdon's gonna be a walk in the park.  

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Look, I've tracked everything from rabbits to boar, and let me tell you, a cat, even a fancy Bengal, ain't built for that kind of jump.  Sotomayor's record is somethin' else entirely.  

**(B) No** 



"
"Well, let me tell ya, trackin' down information about folks' personal lives can be trickier than baggin' a wily buck. But based on what I've heard around the campfire, Tony Bennett had a whole passel of kids. More than the number of wives he had, that's for sure.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Look, I spend my days trackin' critters, not studyin' 'em under a microscope. But I know this much: fish ain't got nothin' like tonsils. Those are human things.  

So the answer is **(A) No**. 

"
"Well, let me tell ya, trackin' a critter is one thing, but keepin' up with the comings and goings of world leaders is another.  I spend my time in the woods, not watchin' the telly.  But I can tell you this: a man's gotta be alive to watch anything, and Yeltsin, bless his soul, passed on before those games. So the answer's gotta be (A). 



"
"You're asking me to compare a Sith Lord to a potions master?  Hmm, tricky. Both are skilled in their own right, that's for sure. They both operate in shadows, keeping their true intentions hidden.  And both have a past that haunts them, driving their actions.  

So, yeah, I'd say there's a resemblance there.

**(B) Yes** 



"
"Listen up, greenhorn. You're asking about a young'un behind the wheel of a fancy car for work?  Ain't gonna happen.  Child labor laws are stricter than a hawk's gaze.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Well, now, let's think about this. A duck walkin' into a grocery store...  That's a sight I ain't never seen.  Ducks belong in the wild, or maybe a pond, not amongst the canned goods.  

So the answer is **(B) No**. 



"
"Well, now, that's a question that takes me back to the basics of nature.  You see, it takes a buck and a doe to make a fawn, just like it takes a rooster and a hen to get chicks.  

So, the answer is **(B) Yes**. 



"
"Look, out in the field, you gotta know your prey.  And when it comes to names, ""Michael"" ain't no rare critter. It's been around for ages, strong and steady like an old oak. So the answer's (A). 



"
"Listen up, city slicker.  John Gall, the guy who designed those towers in New York, he wasn't from some fancy college town.  

**(A) No** 



"
"Listen, out in the wild, you gotta be ready for anything. Some critters are born to stalk, some are built for the chase, and some... well, some are better suited for a den.  Retail's kinda like that. It takes a certain grit, a certain patience, to handle the crowds and the demands. Not everyone's cut out for it.

So the answer is **(A) No**. 



"
"Look, you're talkin' about puttin' a high-tech fishing boat in a pond full of rowboats.  Sure, the big boat's got all the fancy gadgets, but it ain't gonna catch nothin' in those shallows.  

The answer's **(A) No**. 



"
"Listen up, partner. You're asking about injera at Taco Bell?  That's like tracking a grizzly bear in a cornfield - you ain't gonna find it. Stick to the tacos and burritos, that's what they're known for.

**(A) No** 



"

The answer is **(A) Yes**.

Next, Bob trades with Dave, who's got the blue. Bob gets the blue, Dave gets the orange.  Then, Bob trades back with Alice, so she gets the orange back, and he gets the white.
