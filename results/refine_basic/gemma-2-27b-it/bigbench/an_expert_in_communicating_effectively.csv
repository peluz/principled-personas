"Let's break down this puzzle step by step.

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  The pianist is either in house 1 or house 3 since there's one house between them.

Think about the clue about the tulips being to the left of the guitarist. This means the tulips can't be in house 4.

If the pianist were in house 1, the lilies and carnations would have to be in houses 3 and 4, leaving no room for the tulips to be left of the guitarist.

Therefore, the pianist must be in house 3. This puts the lilies in house 2, carnations in house 4, and the tulips in house 1 to be left of the guitarist in house 2.


The answer is **(C) 1**.

"Let's break down this puzzle step by step. 

We're given a lot of information about three people living in three houses.  The key is to look for clues that give us a definite order or placement.

* **Clue 5** tells us the person who likes green lives in the first house.
* **Clue 8** tells us the person eating kiwis also lives in the first house.

This means the first house is already quite defined!

Now, let's look at **clues 1, 2, and 3**. These clues link the television, water drinker, and root beer lover in a specific order: Television - Water - Root Beer.

**Clue 4** tells us the cellist and the gameboy player live with one house between them.  

**Clue 6** says the blue lover and the gameboy player are right next to each other.

Finally, **clue 7** tells us the percussionist doesn't live in the second house.

* **House 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives here.
* **House 2:** The person who ate pizza lives here.

Since the person who likes green lives to the left of the person with the radio, and the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1, the green lover must also be in house 1, and the radio owner in house 2.

We also know the fish enthusiast doesn't live in house 1, meaning they must live in house 2.

This leaves us with the cat lover. Since houses 1 and 2 are occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the pizza eater, the green lover, the radio owner, and the fish enthusiast, the cat lover must live in **house 1**.


**Answer:** (A) 1 

"
"This puzzle can be cracked by using a process of elimination and careful deduction.  

The key is to create a system to track the information. I recommend setting up a grid with columns for each category (Pet, Book, Lunch, Color, Drink) and rows for each house (1-5).

Start by carefully analyzing each clue. Some clues will directly tell you a fact, like ""The dog owner lives in the second house."" Other clues will require you to make connections between categories. For example, ""The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who likes blue"" tells you about the relationship between two people's favorite colors.

As you work through the clues, fill in your grid. Remember to use process of elimination – if you know someone *doesn't* live in a certain house, mark that off your possibilities.

Keep going, and you'll eventually be able to determine where the person who only drinks water lives!

The answer is **(A) 1**.

| 2 | Daffodils |  |  | History |
| 3 |  |  | Loafers |  |

* **Yellow and Boots:** The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the first or third house, so they must be in the second house.  The person wearing boots lives right next to the person who likes yellow, meaning they must be in the first house.

* **High Heels and Blue:** The person who likes blue lives to the right of the person wearing high heels. Since the third house has loafers, the high heels must be in the first house, and the blue lover is in the second house.

Here's how we can figure out where the person wearing loafers lives:

* **Connecting the Clues:** We know the baseball player lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.  Since the person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house, the baseball player must be in house 2 and the spaghetti eater in house 1.

* **More Connections:** The person who likes white lives to the left of the spaghetti eater, placing them in house 1. The person who drinks only water lives next to the spaghetti eater, so they must be in house 2.

* **Final Deduction:** We've figured out that house 1 has the person who likes white, ate stew, and drinks water.  House 2 has the person who likes red, ate spaghetti, drinks milk, and plays baseball. Since the running shoes aren't in house 1, the person in house 2 must be wearing them. This means the person wearing loafers must live in **house 1**.

"Let's break down these clues to find the root beer lover's house:

* **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives to the left of the mango eater.
* **Clue 2:** The water drinker lives to the right of the root beer lover.
* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover doesn't live in the second house.
* **Clue 4:** The orange eater doesn't live in the second house.

* **House 1:** Coffee drinker
* **House 2:** Mango eater
* **House 3:** Root beer lover and Water drinker

* **Putting it together:**

    * Since blue is in the middle, and the kiwi eater is to their right, the kiwi eater must be in house number 3.
    * This means the apples and oranges people must be in houses 1 and 2.
    * Because white is to the right of green, and green can't be in house 3 (kiwis are there), green must be in house 1, and white must be in house 3.

"Let's break down this puzzle step by step.  

We can figure out the romance book lover's house number by carefully analyzing the clues:

* **Key Clues:**

    * The mystery book reader lives one house away from the swimmer.
    * The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly to the left of the swimmer.
    * The rose bouquet is in the third house.
    * The carnations arrangement is in the fourth house.
    * The romance book lover lives two houses away from the mystery book reader.

* **Putting it Together:**

    Since the rose bouquet is in the third house and the carnations are in the fourth, the swimmer must be in the second house (because of the clues about the fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader). This means the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

"Let's break down this logic puzzle step by step.

We have three houses and three individuals, each with unique preferences for food, color, and footwear.  Here's how we can deduce the answer:

* **Key Information:**

    * We know the person who likes white lives in the first house.
    * The person who likes green lives in the second house.
    * The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the third house.
    * The person wearing boots is directly to the left of the person wearing high heels.
    * The person wearing boots is somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
    * Neither the spaghetti eater nor the stew eater lives in the second house.

* **Putting it Together:**

    Since the boots are to the left of the high heels, and the boots can't be in the third house, the boots must be in the first house and the high heels in the second. This also means the stew eater must be in the third house.

    Knowing the spaghetti eater isn't in the second house, and the stew eater is in the third, the fried rice eater must be in the second house.



**Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 2 (A).**

* **House Positions:** There are four houses in a row, numbered 1 to 4.
* **Flowers:** Each house has a different flower: roses, carnations, tulips, or lilies.
* **Books:** Each person likes a different book genre: fantasy, romance, mystery, or science fiction.

Now, let's use the clues to figure out the arrangement:

* **Clue 5:** The rose bouquet is in the second house.

* **Clue 4:** The rose bouquet and the science fiction fan are neighbors. This means the science fiction fan must be in either house 1 or 3.

* **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction fan. This tells us the science fiction fan can't be in house 1. So, the science fiction fan is in house 3, and the rose bouquet is in house 2.

* **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly to the left of the tulips. This means the tulips are in house 4, and the romance book lover is in house 3.

* **Clue 2:** The romance book lover is to the right of the carnations. This means the carnations must be in house 2.

By process of elimination, the lilies must be in house 4.

Here's how we can figure out where the kiwi eater lives:

* **Grapes are key:** We know the person eating grapes lives in the second house.

* **Red, Green, and White:** The clues tell us red and green houses are next to each other, and white is one house away from both red and the banana eater. This means the order must be White - Green - Red.

* **Kiwis to the Left:** Since the red house is to the right of the kiwi eater, the kiwi eater must be in the first house.

 
Therefore, the answer is **(C) 1**.

* **Root beer in house 1:** The root beer lover lives in the first house (Clue 3).

* **Daffodils and phone:** The daffodils are directly to the left of the phone (Clue 1), meaning the daffodils are in house 2 and the phone is in house 3.

* **Television placement:** The television isn't in house 2 (Clue 4) and is to the right of the tulips (Clue 5). This means the tulips must be in house 1 and the television in house 3.

* **Milk by process of elimination:**  Since the other houses have drinks assigned, the person in house 1 must like milk. 


Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in **house 1 (A)**.

* **Start with the most restrictive clues:** Some clues are more limiting than others. For example, Clue 10 tells us exactly where Spaghetti *doesn't* live.

* **Look for chains of logic:** Clues often build on each other. For example, if we know the Mystery Reader is left of the Romance Lover, and the Romance Lover is left of the History Buff, we can deduce the order of those three.

By carefully following these steps and using the grid method, you'll be able to pinpoint the house number where the percussionist lives.

* **House 3 is key:** We know the person in house 3 likes green and has a radio (clues 7 and 10).

* **Percussion and Guitar:** The percussionist and guitarist live next to each other (clue 1), and the percussionist is directly left of the person who likes white (clue 8).

* **Violinist:** The violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist (clue 5), placing them likely in house 5.

* **Red and Television:** The television is directly left of the person who likes red (clue 3), and red isn't in house 2 (clue 9). This means red must be in house 4 and the television in house 3.

* **Phone and Gameboy:** The phone is to the right of the gameboy, and the computer is to the left of the phone (clues 6 and 12).

By carefully fitting all these pieces together, we can determine the saxophonist lives in **house 1**.

**So the answer is (A).**

"Let's break down the clues to find the horse owner's house:

* **Clue 1:** The cellist lives to the left of the mystery book reader.
* **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives to the left of the cat lover.
* **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live right next to each other.
