"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the tulips are.  

We know the flutist lives in the second house. And the pianist is either one house before or after the flutist.

The lilies have to be right before the carnations.  

And the tulips have to be before the guitarist.

Hmmm... if the pianist is in the first house, there's no room for the tulips to be before the guitarist. So the pianist must be in the third house! That means the lilies are in the second house, and the carnations are in the fourth.

That leaves the tulips in the first house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The person who likes green lives in the first house.
* The person eating kiwis also lives in the first house.
* The TV person, the water drinker, and the root beer lover are in that order, from left to right.

Hmm, that means the second house can't be the cellist because the percussionist can't be there either.  

The blue lover and the gameboy person live right next to each other, and the cellist is one house away from the gameboy person. So the cellist must be in the last house!

**Answer: (C)**
"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... we gotta match up who eats what, what they drink, what shoes they wear, what sport they play, and their favorite color. And we have to figure out which house they live in!

There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.  I'm gonna try writing down the clues and then see if I can start putting things together.

*Hmm, thinking, thinking...*

Okay, I think I got it!  The person who likes green lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drinks tea and what house they live in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* We know the person in the first house eats apples.
* The person with high heels lives in the third house.

Hmm, let me see...

* The truck person lives to the left of the SUV person.
* The loafers person lives to the left of the convertible person.

Okay, this is getting tricky!

* Grapes are to the right of the coffee drinker.
* Running shoes are to the right of spaghetti.

Wait, there's a lot about the truck!

* The truck is to the left of fried rice.
* The truck is to the right of the tea drinker.

Oh! So the tea drinker is somewhere to the left of the truck!

* Coffee is to the right of running shoes.
* Pizza is to the left of coffee.
* Root beer is to the left of running shoes.
* Pizza and mangos live next to each other.

Whew! That's a lot of clues.  If I put it all together, I think the tea drinker lives in **House 2**.



So the answer is (A).
"
"Okay, so the grilled cheese person lives in the fifth house. That's easy!

So the answer is **(A) 5**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a few things:

* There's a soccer player, a basketball player, and a swimmer.
* One person eats a banana, one eats mangos, and one eats oranges.
* There are tulips, lilies, and daffodils in the houses.

Here are the clues:

1. The soccer player lives to the left of the orange eater.
2. The swimmer and the daffodil person live right next to each other.
3. The tulip person lives to the right of the mango eater.
4. The daffodil person lives to the right of the orange eater.

Hmm... let me see...

If the daffodil person is to the right of the orange eater, and the swimmer is next to the daffodil person, then it has to go: Orange eater - Swimmer - Daffodil person.

And since the tulip person is to the right of the mango eater, it must be: Mango eater - Tulip person - ...

Putting it all together, I think the daffodil person lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the tulips are.  There are clues about who lives where and what they like.

Hmm, some clues say things are to the left or right of each other.  And one clue says the violinist is in the first house.

I think we gotta try different things and see if it fits. It's like a game!

I'm gonna guess the tulips are in house **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the gameboy.  Let's see...

* We know the bird person doesn't live in the first or last house, so they must be in the middle one.
* The mystery book reader is also in the middle house.
* The history book person is right next to the lilies, so they must be in the first house.
* And the gameboy person is right next to the roses...

Hmm, putting it all together, the gameboy person has to be in the first house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, this puzzle seems tricky! Let's see...

There are five houses, and everyone has different stuff like fruits, pets, gadgets, and flowers. We gotta figure out where the phone is.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues!  I'm gonna try to keep track of everything.

* The horses are in the third house, that's a good start!

* The dog person is right next to the lilies, so they must be in house number two.

* Oh, and the grapes have to be after the horses, so maybe in house four or five.

*  I think I need to draw a little picture to keep track of all this...

*  Okay, I'm gonna look at the clues about the radio and carnations, they seem important.

*  Wait a minute, the banana person is somewhere before the carnations, and there's a house in between!

*  This is like a puzzle with lots of pieces!

*  Let me see... I think I got it!

The phone is in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each.  Let's see...

* One wears sandals, one wears boots.
* One likes mysteries, one likes history books.
* One drives a convertible, one drives a truck.

Hmm... the convertible person is right next to the history lover. And the boots person doesn't live in the first house.

That means the convertible person must be in the first house, and the history lover is in the second house.  Since the boots person can't be in the first house, they must be in the second house.

So, the sandals person has to be in the first house!

**Answer: (A) 1** 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The golfer lives in the first house.
* The swimmer lives right next to the romance book lover, and the swimmer isn't in the third house.
* The mystery book reader is right next to the history book buff.
* The basketball player can't be in the last house.

Hmm... let's see... if the swimmer is next to the romance reader, and the swimmer isn't in the third house, they must be in the second house, and the romance reader is in the third!

And since the mystery reader is next to the history buff, they have to be in house 2, and the history buff is in house 3.

We know the golfer is in the first house, and the basketball player can't be in the last house. That means the basketball player must be in the third house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"The mystery book reader lives in house number 3.  That's what clue number 3 says! 



"
"Okay, so we have three houses and three people, each with a different gadget and a favorite color.  Let's see...

The green lover lives right next to the Gameboy person, and the Gameboy person is right next to the computer person.  Oh, and the yellow lover can't be in the middle house.

Hmm... that means the computer person has to be in the last house! 

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the coffee drinker lives.  Let's see...

* We know the root beer lover is in house number 3.
* And the person who likes red also lives in house number 3.

Hmm, that means coffee can't be in houses 1 or 2 because the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who likes green.

* Oh! And the history book person can't be in house number 4.

Let me think... the romance book lover can't be in house 1, and the mystery book reader can't be in house 4.

* Wait, the romance book lover has to be right next to the history book lover!

Okay, so if we put all that together, the coffee drinker has to be in house number 4!


**Answer: (B)**
"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The fantasy book person lives in house number 1.
* The pizza person doesn't live in house number 1.
* The green lover is right next to the radio person.

Hmmm... that means the green lover must be in house 1 and the radio person is in house 2!

Also, the fish person doesn't live in house 1, so they must be in house 2.

That leaves house 1 for the cat lover!

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

It's like a big matching game. You gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.  

I'd start by writing down all the clues and then try to match them up. Like, if someone likes milk and lives next to someone who likes blue, you can write that down. Then look for other clues that might help you figure out who lives in which house.

It takes some time, but if you keep going, you'll get it!

Good luck!

* We know the cat person is in the first house.
* The tulip person is right next to the dog person.
* The horse person is somewhere with one house between them and the carnation person.
* The lily person is to the right of the horse person.

Hmm... if we think about it, the only way all that fits is if the fish person is in the last house!

So the answer is (D) 4. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing high heels.

We know the phone person is in house number 1. And the boots person doesn't live in house number 2, so they must be in house number 1 too.

That means the high heels person has to be in house number 2!

So the answer is (A) 2. 👠
"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out who likes green and what house they live in. There are clues about shoes, colors, food, and stuff.

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person who likes green lives in **house 3 (C)**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the bird keeper lives. Let's see...

* We know the baseball player is in house number 2.
* The basketball player is somewhere before the swimmer, and they can't be in house 1. So the basketball player must be in house 3, and the swimmer in house 4.
* The tennis player is right next to the cat lover.
* The bird keeper can't be in houses 1 or 3.

Hmmm... that means the bird keeper has to be in house 4! 

So the answer is **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the soccer player lives.  There are clues about colors, cars, instruments, stuff like that.

Hmm, I think the best way to do this is to write it all down.

* House 1:  
* House 2:
* House 3:

Okay, now let's look at the clues.

* Clue 1 says the person who likes white lives to the right of the computer person.
* Clue 2 says the baseball player lives next to the person who likes blue.
* Clue 3 says the sedan is right next to the SUV.

* Clue 5 says the violinist doesn't live in the first house.
* Clue 6 says the sedan and gameboy are right next to each other.
* Clue 7 says the guitarist lives to the right of the person who likes white.

Whew, that's a lot!  I'm gonna start by putting in the stuff I know for sure.

Like, Clue 3 and 6 tell me the sedan and SUV are together, and the gameboy is with them.

Let me think... I'm gonna try writing it out and see if I can figure out the rest.

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The soccer player lives in **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so the question is asking which house the grilled cheese eater lives in.  

Clue number 11 says ""The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.""

So the answer is **(E) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we have these three houses and we gotta figure out where the TV is.

Let's see... the clues are kinda like a puzzle.

* The pianist can't be in the first house.
* The orange eater is somewhere to the right of the kiwi eater.
* The high heel wearer and the pianist are neighbors.
* The running shoe wearer and the drummer are neighbors.
* The kiwi eater is to the left of the boot wearer.
* The radio person is to the left of the high heel wearer.
* The orange eater is right next to the TV person.

Hmm... let me draw some houses...

Okay, so the kiwi eater has to be in the first house, and the orange eater is in the last house because they have to be in order.

And the TV person is right next to the orange eater, so the TV must be in the last house too!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the sedan is parked. There are clues about drinks, food, and colors, and they all have to match up with the houses and cars.

It's like a puzzle! I'm gonna try drawing it out on paper, maybe that will help.

Hmmm... after looking at all the clues, I think the sedan is parked in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the kiwi person is in house number 1.  And the truck and SUV people can't be in house 3.  

Since the truck can't be in house 1 either, it must be in house 2.  That means the SUV person has to be in house 2 too, because they can't be in house 1 or 3.

So the answer is (B) House 2. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the fried rice person is in house number 3. And the spaghetti person is right next to them, so they must be in house number 2. 

The answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person wearing boots lives. There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta be careful.

Hmm, some clues tell us where things *aren't*. Like, the truck isn't in the fourth house, and the SUV isn't in the first.

Oh! And the person who likes blue lives in the fifth house. That's a good start!

Let me think...  boots are left of the truck, and loafers are left of the truck too.  

*Looks at clues again, muttering to self*

Okay, I think I got it! The person wearing boots lives in house **(A) 2**. 



"
"The history book buff lives in house number 1. Clue number 2 says so! 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

It's like a big game of connect-the-dots, but with houses and people.  

You gotta look at all the clues and see how they fit together. Like, if someone eats stew, they can't also eat grapes, right?

I'd start by writing down all the clues and then making a list of all the things each person could be (like, who plays what instrument, what they eat, etc.). Then I'd try to match them up based on the clues.

It's gonna take some time, but I bet we can figure out where the apple eater lives!

I think the answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a bunch of stuff about these people and their houses:

* They each have different flowers, like lilies, carnations, and daffodils.
* They each like a different color: green, blue, or yellow.
* They each wear different shoes: boots, loafers, or high heels.
* They each like a different kind of book: romance, history, or science fiction.

There are also some clues:

1. The blue lover lives to the right of the high heel wearer.

3. The history buff lives in the second house.
4. The yellow lover doesn't live in the third house.

6. The loafer wearer lives in the third house.
7. The daffodil lover lives in the second house.
8. The boot wearer and the yellow lover live right next to each other.

Hmm... let me see...

Okay, I think the history buff is in the second house, and the loafer wearer is in the third house.  We also know the daffodils are in the second house.

The yellow lover can't be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second house. That means the boot wearer is in the first house.

Since the blue lover is to the right of the high heel wearer, the high heel wearer must be in the first house too.

That means the green lover must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so the first clue says the person with running shoes lives in the first house.  

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the cricketer lives in the first house.  And the truck driver is always to the right of the basketball player.  

Hmmm... the person with horses is right next to the person with a sedan.

That means the basketball player has to be in the middle house, right? 

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Okay, so we gotta figure out where the tulips are. There are a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they have.  It's like a detective game!

I'd start by writing down all the stuff each house has, like a list. Then I'd look for clues that tell me if things are next to each other or far apart.

Let me think... I'll try to figure it out!

...

Hmmm, after looking at all the clues, I think the tulips are in house number **(C) 5**. 



"

"
"Okay, this is like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the cellist lives.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's try to put them together.

* We know the saxophonist is in the second house.
* The tea drinker is in the last house.
* The cellist is right before the tea drinker, so they must be in the third house!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the truck driver lives. There are a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.

Hmm, let me think...  

* The minivan is in the last house, and the root beer lover is in the third house.

I think the truck driver must live in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drinks coffee and what house they live in.  

Let's see... the tea drinker is in the first house, that's easy. And the person with apples is somewhere before the minivan person. Oh, and the sci-fi fan is to the left of the convertible driver.

* The red lover is right next to the mystery book reader.
* The fantasy book person can't be in the first house.
* The white lover isn't in the last house.
* And, the red lover is in the middle house.

Hmmm... if the red lover is in the middle, the mystery book reader must be in the last house. That means the fantasy book person has to be in the first house!

So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"Okay, so the SUV person lives in house number 3. That's what clue number 5 says! 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out who drinks root beer.  There are three houses, and each person is different.

* The TV person is next to the tea drinker.

* The TV person is next to the guitar player.
* The flute player and banana eater aren't right next to each other.
* The tulips are after the radio.
* The roses are in the middle house.

I think we can use these clues to figure out where everyone is and what they like. It's like a detective game!

Let me think... I'll try drawing it out.

...

Okay, I think I got it!  The root beer lover lives in **house number 1**. 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the science fiction bookworm lives.  Let's see...

There are clues about who lives next to who and what they like.  

* We know the fantasy book person is in the third house.
* The history person is right next to them, so they're in the second house.
* The science fiction person is somewhere to the right of the fantasy person, so they gotta be in the fourth house!

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing sandals. Let's see...

We know the fried rice eater isn't in the first house, and the SUV isn't in the second house.  The flutist is right next to the person who likes white, and the loafers are right next to the person who likes white too.

That means the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the flutist is in the first house. Since the loafers are next to the white lover, they must be in the first house too.

That leaves the sandals for the second house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the violinist lives.  There are clues about flowers, food, cars, instruments, and drinks.

Hmm, let me think...

* The root beer lover is in the last house.
* The water drinker and the minivan person live next to each other.
* The water drinker isn't in the first house.

So, the water drinker must be in the second house, and the minivan person is in the third!

* The sedan is to the left of the daffodils, and the sedan is also to the left of the apples, and the apples are to the left of the violinist.

That means the order has to be: Sedan - Daffodils - Apples - Violinist.

So, the violinist must live in house number **(A) 2**! 



"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

It's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.  

Let's see... there are lots of clues, so we gotta be careful. I'm gonna try writing down all the stuff each person has, like their shoes, favorite color, and what they ate for lunch.

Then, I'll see if I can use the clues to put them in the right houses.

Hmmm... this is gonna take some time!

*Thinking really hard*

Okay, I think I got it!  The person wearing loafers lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we know there are two houses, and each person in them has different stuff.

The person with the TV lives in the first house. And the person with the lilies doesn't live in the first house. That means they must live in the second house!

If the second house has the lilies, then the computer must be in the second house too.


**Answer:** (A) 2 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.  

Let's see... the science fiction fan has to be in the house on the left because the golfer is to their right.  And the pizza person and the history buff are right next to each other.  

Oh! And the guitarist is to the right of the daffodils. So the daffodils can't be in the house on the right, they gotta be in the house on the left. That means the guitarist is in the house on the right!

So the percussionist has to be in the house on the left.

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... we have five houses and a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

Hmm, it says the guitarist is to the left of the gameboy person, and the TV person is left of the gameboy person too.  And the violinist is in the fourth house, and the bird person is in the fifth.

Oh! The fish person and the horse person live next to each other, and there are two houses between the phone person and the horse person.

I'm gonna draw a little picture to help me keep track...

*draws a bunch of boxes and starts writing in them*

Okay, I think I got it! The percussionist lives in house number 2.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One has a rose bouquet and the other has lilies. One person eats oranges, the other eats apples. One person swims, the other plays basketball. One has a radio, the other has a computer. And one plays the piano, the other plays the violin.

Let's see... the lilies are in the first house. And the basketball player isn't in the first house, so they must be in the second house.

Hmm, the radio is to the right of the person eating apples, and it's also to the right of the violinist. That means the violinist has to be in the first house! 

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"Okay, this is like a puzzle! Let's see...

We know the tennis player is in house number 3, and the grilled cheese eater is in house number 5. The golfer is in house number 4.

Hmm, the fried rice and spaghetti people have to be a little ways apart.  And the pizza person is somewhere before the cricketer.

Oh! The stew person is right next to the spaghetti person.

I think I got it!  The cricketer must live in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's wearing loafers.  Let's see...

We know a bunch of stuff about these two people:

* They both like different foods, colors, drinks, and sports.
* One wears running shoes and the other wears loafers.

Here are the clues:

1. The running shoe person doesn't live in the first house.
2. The white lover lives right next to the spaghetti eater.
3. The baseball player and spaghetti eater are neighbors.
4. The water drinker and spaghetti eater are neighbors.

Hmm... let's think. If the running shoe person isn't in the first house, they must be in the second house.  And since the baseball player and spaghetti eater are neighbors, and the water drinker and spaghetti eater are neighbors, the spaghetti eater must be in the first house!

That means the person in the first house likes white, eats spaghetti, and drinks water.  The second house must have the red lover, the baseball player, and the milk drinker.

Since the running shoes are in the second house, the loafers must be in the **first house**.

So the answer is **(B)**! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know a few things:

* There are three houses, and each person in a house likes a different fruit and drink.
* The coffee person lives somewhere to the left of the mango person.
* The water person lives somewhere to the right of the root beer person.
* The root beer person doesn't live in the middle house.
* The orange person doesn't live in the middle house either.

Hmm... if the root beer person can't be in the middle, and the orange person can't be in the middle, then the mango person *must* be in the middle house!

That means the coffee person is in the first house, and the water person and root beer person are in the last house.

So the answer is (C)! 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know:

* House 1 has the spaghetti eater.
* The fried rice person isn't in House 2.
* The boots person is right next to the fried rice person.
* The loafers person isn't in House 1.

Hmmm... so if the fried rice person isn't in House 2, and the boots person is next to them, then the fried rice person must be in House 3 and the boots person is in House 2.

That means the loafers person has to be in House 2!

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Okay, so we gotta figure out where the mystery book reader lives. There are a bunch of clues about cars, food, fruit, books, and stuff.  

The best way to do this is to make a chart with the houses numbered 1 to 5 and write down all the clues. Then, we can start filling in the chart using the clues.

It's like a detective game! We gotta look for clues that tell us where things are in relation to each other. Like, if someone lives to the left of someone else, we can figure out their house numbers.

It might take a while, but if we're careful, we can solve it!

Let me think...  I'll try to figure it out and let you know!

"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the lilies are.  There are a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

It's like a puzzle! We gotta use the clues to figure out where everything fits.

Hmmm... I think the answer is **(E) 4**. 

I'm pretty sure, but it took me a while to figure it out! 



"
"Okay, so we know the mystery reader is in house number 1.  And the tennis player isn't in house number 1, so they must be in house number 2. That means the fantasy book person has to be in house number 2 too!

**Answer: (B) 2** 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person who likes white lives. There are a bunch of clues about who lives where and what they like.

It's like a puzzle! We gotta use the clues to figure out who lives in each house.

Hmmm... I think the answer is **(A) 3**. 

I'm not totally sure, but I think that's where all the clues point! 



"
"Okay, this puzzle seems tricky!  Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person who drinks only water lives. There are clues about colors, shoes, drinks, instruments, and sports.  

Hmm, I think we need to look for clues that connect those things. Like, maybe someone who plays basketball also likes a certain color or wears a certain type of shoe.

I'm gonna try writing down all the clues and see if I can spot any patterns.

...

*Thinking really hard*

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so the first clue says the person who likes red lives in the first house.  So the answer is (C) 1. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Okay, so we gotta figure out where the person with the lilies lives. There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* Some clues tell us where things are, like the swimmer is in house number 4 and the person with running shoes is in house 1.
* Other clues say things are next to each other, like the person with loafers is right next to the person with carnations.

We gotta use all the clues together like puzzle pieces to figure out where everything goes. It's like a big matching game!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  

... *scribbles furiously on a piece of paper* ...

Okay, I think I got it!  The person with the lilies lives in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The kiwi eater is in house number 1.
* The science fiction fan is in house number 2.

The bird person and the high heel wearer are neighbors, and so are the tennis player and the apple eater.  Since the kiwi eater is already in house 1, the bird person and high heel wearer must be in house 2. That means the tennis player and apple eater are also in house 2.

The dog owner can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 2.

That leaves the cricketer! They have to be in house 1.

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

We gotta figure out who's eating grapes. There are a bunch of clues about who lives where, what they eat, and what they like to do.

It's like a puzzle! We gotta put all the pieces together.

Hmmm... I think the best way to do this is to write down all the clues and then try to match them up.

*  The grilled cheese and pizza people live next door to each other.
* The cat person lives right next to the fish person.
* The fried rice person doesn't live in the first house.
* The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
* The cricket player lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
* There are two houses between the spaghetti person and the bird person.
* The cricket player lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
* The orange person lives somewhere to the right of the mango person.
* The orange person lives in the second house.
* The fish person lives in the third house.
* The bird person lives somewhere to the right of the apple person.
* The swimmer lives in the second house.
* The pizza person lives in the fifth house.
* There's one house between the dog person and the kiwi person.

Whew! That's a lot of clues!

Okay, let me think...

I'm gonna start with the ones that seem easiest. We know the orange person is in the second house, and the swimmer is also in the second house. So, the swimmer must be eating oranges!

And the fish person is in the third house...

This is gonna take some time, but I bet I can figure it out!

...

(After some more thinking and scribbling)

Okay, I got it! The person eating grapes lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is like a super hard puzzle!  Let's see...

There are four houses, and everyone in them is different.  We gotta figure out who ate pizza.

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, we know the green lover is in the first house, and the fried rice eater is in the last house.

And the truck is right next to the lilies!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  It's gonna take some time to figure out who had the pizza, but I'll get there!

...

*Thinking really hard*

...

Okay, I think I got it!  The pizza person is in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating mangos.

We know the baseball player lives in house number 2 and drives a convertible.  And the grape eater doesn't live in house number 1.

That means the mango person has to be in house number 1!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a few things:

* There are three houses, and each person in them likes a different color and eats a different fruit.
* The blue lover is in the middle house.
* The kiwi eater is in the last house.
* The apple eater is right next to the orange eater.
* White is to the right of green.

Hmmm... since blue is in the middle and kiwi is last, green must be first!  And because white is to the right of green, white must be in the last house too!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the roses.  

We know the root beer person is on the right side of the roses.  And the soccer player is right next to the mystery book reader.  Oh, and the gameboy person is on the left side of the mystery book reader.

That means the roses have to be in House 1! 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we have these four houses in a row, and each one has a person with a different pet and car. That's a lot to keep track of!

Let's see... the minivan person lives to the right of the fish person.  And the truck person is right next to the sedan person. Oh, and the fish person is right next to the dog person!

The truck can't be in the last house because there has to be two houses between it and the dog person.  So the truck must be in house 1, then the sedan in house 2. That means the fish person is in house 3 and the dog person is in house 4!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the root beer lover is in the second house, and the yellow lover is in the third.  The clue says the blue lover is to the right of the yellow lover, so blue must be in the fourth house! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the bird keeper lives.  There are three houses, and each person in the houses has different stuff like shoes, pets, favorite colors, fruits, and sports.

There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta use them like puzzle pieces.

Hmmm... I think the best way to do this is to try and figure out who lives in each house one by one.

* Clue 6 says the person who likes blue lives in the middle house (house number 2).

Let me think about the other clues and see if I can put it all together...

...

Okay, after looking at all the clues, I think the bird keeper lives in **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... there are five houses and five people, and each person is different.  We gotta figure out where the tennis player lives.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues!  I'm gonna try to write them down and see if I can connect them.

* The horse person is in the first house.
* The dog person is in the fourth house.
* The coffee person is in the fifth house.
* The cricketer is in the fourth house too.

Okay, that's a good start! Now I gotta see if I can use the other clues to figure out where everyone else is...

...

*Looks intensely at the clues for a while, scribbling on a piece of paper*

...

Aha! I think I got it! The tennis player lives in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I think the best way to do this is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, maybe make a chart or something.

Then we can use the clues to figure out who lives where.  It's like a detective game!

Hmmm... I'm gonna need to think about this one for a bit.  Lots of clues to sort through! 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  One plays guitar and the other plays the cello. One has a computer and the other has a Gameboy. One has a dog and the other has fish.

The clues tell us the cello player is right next to the person with the Gameboy, and the dog owner doesn't live in the first house.

That means the dog owner must live in the second house!

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the SUV is.  

Let's see... the gameboy guy is in house number 3, and the minivan is in house number 1.  

The phone is right next to the SUV, so the SUV can't be in house 1.  The radio is to the right of the gameboy, so it's in house 4. That means the SUV has to be in house 2!

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so we have these five houses and we gotta figure out where the person with the carnations lives.  

Let's see... the tulips are in the third house, and the computer is in the second house. That's a good start!

The phone has to be to the left of the TV, and the lilies are to the right of the phone.  So they're all in a row somewhere.

Oh, and the daffodils are to the right of the radio, but not in the fourth house.

Hmmm... I think if we put it all together, the carnations have to be in the last house!

So the answer is **(E) 5**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the dog owner lives. There are clues about who lives where and what they like.

Hmm, the cricketer is in the second house, and the golfer is in the fourth.  The bird keeper is in the first house.  Oh, and the fish enthusiast is also in the second house.

The sandals person is in the third house, and the baseball player is somewhere to the right of them.

Let me think...  

I think the dog owner must live in the **third house**! 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a bunch of stuff about these two people: what they drink, what fruit they eat, what they had for lunch, what kind of car they drive, and what device they have.  

Here's what I think:

* The radio and truck people live next to each other.
* The grapes person is right next to the computer person.
* The radio person is somewhere to the left of the pizza person.
* The root beer lover doesn't live in the first house.

Hmmm... so if the radio and truck are together, and the grapes and computer are together, that means there are only two ways they could be arranged.

But the pizza person has to be to the right of the radio person, so the pizza person must be in the second house!


**Answer: (A) 2** 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes green and what house they live in.  

Let's see... the tea drinker is in house number 1, and the pizza person is right next door in house 2.  

We also know the milk drinker is somewhere before the spaghetti eater, and the spaghetti eater is before the water drinker. Oh, and the white lover and the water drinker live right next to each other.

Hmm... that means the order has to be milk, then spaghetti, then water, then white (or maybe white, then water, then spaghetti, then milk, but I think the first way makes more sense).

The coffee drinker is somewhere before the yellow lover, and green isn't in house 1, and neither is the grilled cheese person.

Thinking about all that, I think the green lover is in **house 3 (B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes red and what house they live in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* We know the dog person lives in the third house, and the person who likes water lives right next to them.
* The horse person is in the last house.
* The person who likes white also lives in the third house.

Hmm, this is tricky!  Let me see...

* Oh! The minivan person lives right next to the sandals person.
* And the SUV person lives somewhere to the right of the loafers person.

Okay, I think I'm starting to get it...

* The fish person lives in the first house.

Let me think really hard...

*  Aha! The red person lives in the second house!


So the answer is (C).
"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.  I like to write things down, so I'd make a chart with the houses numbered 1 to 5 and then write down all the stuff each person has: drink, fruit, shoes, sport, and flowers.

Then I'd look for clues that tell me exactly where someone lives, like clue 4 says the running shoes are in house number 3.  

After that, I'd look for clues that tell me who lives next to each other, like clue 1 says the swimmer lives to the left of the milk drinker.

It's like a big puzzle, and we gotta put all the pieces together!

I'm gonna try to figure out the whole thing, but it might take a while.

...

Okay, I think I got it! The person with the lilies lives in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the soccer player is in the last house, house number 3.  And the tulips aren't in the last house.

The golfer is right next to the basketball player, so they have to be in houses 1 and 2.

The lilies are right next to the grilled cheese, so the grilled cheese can't be in the first house.

That means the grilled cheese has to be in house number 2!


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate fried rice.  

Let's see... it says the pianist lives in the third house, and the person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house. So, they must be the same person!

The answer is (D) 3. 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person with running shoes lives.  There are clues about food, drinks, and shoes, and they all have to match up.

It's gonna take some thinking, but I bet we can crack it!

Hmmm... I think the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta be careful.  

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, we know the radio is in house number 3, and the basketball player is in house number 4. Oh, and the cricketer and the person wearing loafers are also in house number 3!

We also know the milk drinker is somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, and the milk drinker is right next to the person wearing high heels.

Let's see... the gameboy is right next to the grilled cheese, and the boots are right next to the computer.

Oh, and the root beer lover is somewhere to the left of the radio, and the stew eater is somewhere to the left of the fried rice eater.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of.

Okay, I think I got it!  The computer is in **house number 2**. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we know two people live in houses next to each other. One likes science fiction books and the other likes history books. One ate pizza and one ate fried rice.

The clue says the fried rice eater lives to the right of the science fiction fan. That means the science fiction fan can't be in the house on the right. 

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the pianist lives in the first house.  And the person who likes root beer lives to the right of the horse owner. That means the horse owner can't be in the second house.

Also, the person who likes white doesn't live in the second house either.

So, the horse owner and the person who likes white must both be in the first house. That means the dog owner has to be in the second house!

**Answer: (B) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.  Let's see...

* We know the stew person is in house number 2.
* And the pizza person is in house number 4.

Hmm, that's a good start.

* Oh! The science fiction fan has to be to the left of the percussionist, and the history buff is to the right of the percussionist.

So it's gotta be like this: Science Fiction - Percussion - History

* And the guitarist is to the left of the violinist.

Let me draw it out...

House 1: Science Fiction, Guitarist
House 2: Stew
House 3: Percussion
House 4: Pizza, Violinist

* Oh yeah! The fantasy book person is two houses away from the fried rice person.

So fried rice must be in house 1 and fantasy in house 4.

House 1: Science Fiction, Guitarist, Fried Rice
House 2: Stew, Romance
House 3: Percussion, History
House 4: Pizza, Violinist, Fantasy

That means the percussionist lives in **house 3**.



The answer is (B).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person with horses lives in.  Let's see...

* We know the person who likes white lives in the first house.
* And the person with daffodils lives next to them, so they must be in the second house.
*  The horses have to be next to the daffodils, so they must be in the first house too!


So the answer is **(A) 1**. 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a few things:

* Someone in each house eats a different fruit: apples, oranges, or mangos.
* They also each like a different drink: coffee, root beer, or milk.

Here are the clues:

1. The coffee person lives right next to the milk person.
2. The mango eater lives right next to the apple eater.
3. The coffee person doesn't live in the middle house.
4. The apple eater lives in the last house.

Hmm... since the apple eater is in the last house, that means the mango eater must be in the middle house (because they live right next to the apple eater).

And since the coffee person can't be in the middle house, they must be in the first house. That means the milk person is in the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The science fiction fan lives in the middle house.
* The first house has carnations.
* Someone with loafers and someone who likes red live right next to each other.
* The person who likes white lives right next to the person with tulips.
* The history buff is somewhere to the right of the tulips.
* The boots person doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm... let me think...

If the science fiction person is in the middle, and the first house has carnations, that means the tulips must be in the second house, right? And since the white lover is next to the tulips, they must be in the first house.

Oh! And the history buff is to the right of the tulips, so they must be in the last house.

That means the boots person has to be in the second house because they can't be in the last one.

So the answer is (C)! 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the water drinker is in the first house. And the lilies are in the second house.  That means the milk drinker has to be in the third house because there has to be a house between water and milk.

The lilies are to the right of the tulips, so the tulips must be in the first house.

That leaves the roses for the third house!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the cricketer lives. There are a bunch of clues about people's shoes, favorite colors, stuff they like to do, and what they have.

It's gonna take some thinking, but I bet we can crack it!  

Hmmm... lemme see...

* The cricketer is right next to the person with sandals.
*  The person who likes yellow is in the third house.

Oh! And the tennis player is also in the third house!

Let me think some more...

...

Okay, I think the cricketer lives in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. That's what clue number 4 says!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the computer.  Let's see...

There are three houses, and each person has different stuff: a computer, a radio, or a TV, and they also have different flowers and play different sports.

The clues are kinda like a puzzle.

* The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the TV person.
* The golfer doesn't live in the middle house.
* The computer person and the tulip person live right next to each other.
* The radio person lives to the right of the rose person.
* The radio person also lives to the right of the TV person.

Hmm... I think the computer person must live in the first house.  That way, the tulip person is next to them, and then the TV person could be in the second house, and the radio person in the third.

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We know the swimmer lives in the third house, and the violinist lives in the second. The daffodils are in the fifth house, and the cricketer is in the fourth.

Hmm, the basketball player and baseball player are right next to each other, and the guitarist is somewhere after them. Oh, and the carnations are after the guitarist!

The sandals are right before the tulips, and the running shoes are right before the daffodils.

Let me think...  

*Looks at the clues again, scribbling on a piece of paper*

Aha! I got it! The person wearing sandals lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we know a few things:

* One person has a dog and the other likes fish.
* One person ate stew and the other had grilled cheese.
* One person wears high heels and the other wears sandals.

We also have these clues:

* The high heel wearer lives right next to the fish person.
* The grilled cheese eater is in house number 2.

Hmm... since the grilled cheese person is in house number 2, and they can't also be the fish person, the fish person must be in house number 1.  That means the stew eater has to be in house number 1 too!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... we have five houses and five people, and each person likes different stuff. We gotta figure out where the cat lover lives.

There are a bunch of clues, so let's look at them one by one.

Hmm, some clues tell us where things are, like the romance book lover is in the fifth house and the fish person is in the third.

And some clues say things are next to each other, like the blue lover and the history buff are neighbors.

I'm gonna try drawing a little picture to keep track of everything.

*draws a line with five boxes*

Okay, let me see...

*starts filling in the boxes based on the clues*

Aha! I think I got it! The cat lover lives in the **first house**.

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating oranges and what house they live in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* We know the person with the phone lives in house number 3.
* And the flutist is also in house number 3!
* Oh, and the person with the running shoes is in house 3 too.

Hmm, that's a lot for one house!

*  The person with the grapes and the person with the oranges live right next to each other.
* And the oranges are to the right of whoever is wearing boots.

Let me see... if the oranges are to the right of the boots, and the grapes are next to the oranges, then the grapes must be in house 1, the boots in house 2, and the oranges in house 2 too!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the apple eater lives.  There are a bunch of clues about colors, food, and drinks, and they all have to match up.

It's like a puzzle where each clue is a piece. We gotta put them together to see the whole picture.

Hmm... I think the best way to do this is to write down all the clues and then try to figure out what goes where.

*Looks intensely at the clues for a few minutes, scribbling on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person eating apples lives in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out who ate pizza. There are clues about shoes, food, books, and cars, and they all have to match up with the houses.

It's gonna take some thinking, but I'll try to keep track of everything.

Hmmm... I think the answer is **(C) 2**. 

Let me know if I got it right! 



"
"Okay, let's see... there are five houses and five people, each liking a different kind of book and playing a different instrument. That's a lot to keep track of!

Hmm, let's look at the clues.  

* The mystery person is in house number 4, and the sax player is also in house 4. That means the person who plays the percussion must be in house 3, right next door, because clue 4 says they're right next to the romance book lover.

*  The history book person is one house away from the guitar player, and the mystery person is in house 4, so the history person must be in house 2 and the guitar player in house 5.

* The romance book lover has to be to the left of the fantasy book lover, so the fantasy book lover must be in house 5.

* The sax player and the violin player are next to each other, and the sax player is in house 4, so the violin player must be in house 3!


So the answer is (C)!
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the Gameboy is. Let's see...

* The TV is in the last house, number 4.
* Loafers are in house number 2.
* The phone isn't in house 2.
* Boots are somewhere before the loafers, so they must be in house 1.
* The radio and sandals have two houses between them.

Hmmm... that means the radio must be in house 1 and the sandals in house 3!  

So, the Gameboy has to be in house 3.

The answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so the person in the second house wears high heels. That's pretty straightforward! 

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 👠🏠
"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people. One likes history books and the other likes mysteries. One wears loafers and the other wears high heels.

The first clue says the loafer person doesn't live in the first house. That means they must live in the second house! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate pizza and what house they live in.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

*  Some clues say things are right next to each other, like the running shoes and the gameboy.
*  Others say things are to the left or right, like the pizza being left of the sandals.

If we draw it out like a little map of the houses, and write down the clues, we can start to fill things in. It's like a puzzle!

After looking at all the clues, I think the person who ate pizza lives in **house number 3**.


So the answer is (B).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating apples.

We know the mango person is in house number 1. And the sax player is in house number 2, not house 1.

The roses are in the house before the lilies, so the roses must be in house 1 and the lilies in house 2.

That means the apple eater has to be in house number 2! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the coffee drinker lives in.  There are a bunch of clues, but the one that tells us straight up is clue number 5:

* **Clue 5: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.**

So the answer is **(E) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drives the truck.  Let's see...

* We know the tulips aren't in the last house.
* The SUV is right next to the lilies.
* The sedan and roses are buddies, right next to each other.
* And the roses aren't in the middle house.

Hmm... I think that means the roses are in the first house, the sedan is in the second, and the SUV is in the second house too, with the lilies in the last house. That leaves the truck for the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see...

We need to figure out where the milk drinker lives. There are a bunch of clues about instruments, flowers, drinks, and books.  

It's like a big matching game! We gotta look for clues that tell us who lives next to who, and what they like.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

... *scribbles furiously on a piece of paper* ...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The milk drinker lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the basketball player lives. There are clues about colors, sports, cars, and fruits, and they all have to match up with the houses.

It's like a puzzle! I'm gonna try to keep track of everything in my head.

Hmmm...  I think the answer is **(C) 3**. 

I hope I got it right! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The green lover lives in the last house (house number 3).
* The yellow lover lives right next to the green lover, so they must be in house number 2.
* The stew eater is right next to the romance book lover, and the stew eater can't be in the last house. So, the stew eater must be in house 1, and the romance lover is in house 2.

That means the fantasy book lover has to be in the last house (house 3).

We've figured out green, yellow, romance, and fantasy. That leaves blue! Since the other colors are taken, the blue lover must live in house number 1.


So the answer is (C) 1.
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the bird keeper lives.  Let's see...

There are clues about flowers, instruments, cars, pets, and colors.  

* We know the person with carnations is in the first house.
* The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
* The bird keeper and the tulips are right next to each other.

Hmm... I think the bird keeper must be in house number **2 (B)**. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  One person plays the piano and the other plays the cello. One likes red, one likes green, one reads mysteries, and one reads fantasy books.

We know the fantasy book person lives in the first house, and so does the cello player. That means the second house must have the mystery reader and the piano player.

Since the green lover is to the left of the red lover, the green lover must be in the first house and the red lover in the second.

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.  

Hmm, some clues tell us things are right next to each other, like the mangos and oranges. And the baseball player is right next to whoever ate grilled cheese.

I think we need to write down all the clues and then try to figure out who lives where. It's like a big matching game!

Okay, I'm gonna try to solve it.  Give me a sec...

...

Okay, I think the swimmer lives in house number **(D) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the swimmer lives.

We know the golfer is in the middle house, the second one. And the history buff is in the first house.

The clue about the swimmer and the science fiction fan being separated by one house means the swimmer can't be in the middle.  So the swimmer has to be in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

There are four houses and four people, each with different stuff like sports, food, pets, and books. We gotta figure out where the stew eater lives.

Hmm, there are a lot of clues!  I'm gonna try to picture it like a row of houses.

* The bird keeper is in the middle house, that's clue number 8.

*  Let me see... the swimmer is somewhere to the left of the apple eater, and the romance book lover is to the right of the swimmer.

* Oh! The person who ate fried rice isn't in the last house.

This is hard! I'm gonna need to think about this some more.  Can I have a little more time? 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  They each like different stuff.

We know:

* One ate fried rice and one ate spaghetti.
* One loves cats and one loves horses.
* One likes history books and one likes romance books.
* One wears sandals and one wears running shoes.

The clues tell us:

1. The sandals person lives to the left of the horse person.
2. The history book person lives to the right of the spaghetti person.

Hmm... let me see...

If the sandals person is in house 1, then the horse person must be in house 2.  But then the history book person has to be in house 2 too because they're to the right of the spaghetti person.  That doesn't leave room for the other stuff!

So, the history book person must be in house 1 and the spaghetti person in house 2.

That means we don't know for sure where the fried rice person lives! It could be either house.



**Answer:  We can't tell for sure.**
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the lilies.

We know the sedan is somewhere to the left of the lilies, so the lilies can't be in the first house.  Also, the flutist doesn't live in the first house either.

That means the lilies have to be in the second house!


**Answer:** (B) 2 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the romance book lover lives.  Let's see...

* We know the rose bouquet is in the third house.
* And the carnations are in the fourth house.

Hmm, that means the daffodils must be in the second house, right? Because the rose and daffodils have to be kinda close together.

Oh! The mystery book reader has to be in the first house, and the swimmer is next door in the second house.

That means the fantasy book lover is in the first house too, right next to the swimmer.

And since the romance book lover is two houses away from the mystery book reader, they gotta be in the fourth house!

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

Okay, so we know the milk drinker lives in the last house, number 5. And the coffee drinker is in house number 3.

Hmm, there are a bunch of clues about things being next to each other.  Like the phone and tulips are right next door. And the gameboy is right next to the computer.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!  The person with the tulips lives in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the rose bouquet. Let's see...

* We know the minivan is in the last house, and the golfer lives in the first house.
* The person with boots is right next to the minivan, so they're in the middle house.
* The person with the rose bouquet isn't in the middle house.
* The pizza eater is to the right of the rose bouquet.
* The cricketer is right next to the tulips, and the tulips are in the last house.

Hmmm... so the rose bouquet has to be in the first house!

**Answer: (A)** 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

It seems like figuring out where the coffee drinker lives is a good start.  They're next to the pizza eater, and also next to the percussionist.  

Hmm, the saxophonist is in the third house, and the flutist is in the second.  

Oh! The yellow lover is left of the saxophonist, so they must be in the second house.

This is tricky! I'm gonna need to draw a little chart to keep track of everything.

...

*Looks intensely at imaginary chart, scribbling with a pencil*

Okay, I think I got it! The percussionist lives in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person who likes white lives.  There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta think step by step.

* Clue 7 says the fried rice person is in house number 3. That's a good start!

*  Hmm, some clues say where things *aren't*. Like, green and stew aren't in house 2, and stew isn't in house 4.

* Clue 6 says the red lover is right next to the stew person.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  It might take a bit to figure this out!

...

*Okay, after looking at all the clues, I think the person who likes white lives in house number **(A) 1***. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the red lover lives in house number 3, and the drummer is in house number 2.  The basketball player has to be to the right of the tennis player, but they can't be in house 3 because the red lover is there.  

That means the basketball player must be in house number 2!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Okay, so we have five houses and we need to figure out where the person with the carnations lives. There are a bunch of clues about flowers, instruments, drinks, and stuff.

I'd start by writing down all the clues and then trying to match them up. Like, if someone has a computer, they live next to the root beer lover.  

It's like a big puzzle, and we gotta put all the pieces together. I'd probably draw a little chart to keep track of everything.

Let me think...  I'm gonna need to look at all the clues really carefully.  

Hmmm... I think the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Okay, so we gotta figure out where the minivan is.  There are a lot of clues, so let's see...

Hmm, some clues tell us things are next to each other, like the sax player and the science fiction fan. And some say things are a certain number of houses apart.

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart with the houses numbered 1 to 5 and write down the clues. Maybe if I see it all laid out, it'll make more sense.

*thinks really hard and doodles on a piece of paper*

Okay, I'm gonna keep working on it! This is like a detective case! 

...

(After some more time thinking)

I think the minivan is in house number **(B) 3**! 



"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... there are five houses, and each person has different stuff. We gotta use the clues to figure out where the tulips are.

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, we know the dog person lives in house number 2, and the fish person is in house number 3.

And the gameboy person can't be in house 2, and the minivan isn't in house 3.

Oh! The tulips are next to the carnations, and they're also next to the convertible! That's helpful.

Let me think...  I'm gonna draw a little picture to keep track of everything...

*draws furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it! The tulips are in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the basketball player lives in the first house and also plays the saxophone. That's cool!  The cricketer is in the second house because the tea drinker is to their left.  

Since the pizza eater is right next to the dog owner, and the basketball player is already in the first house, the pizza eater must be in the first house too, and the dog owner is in the second house.

So the answer is (A)! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the history buff is in house number 1. And the cat person can't be in house number 2.  

The clue about the high heels being to the left of the daffodils means the high heels are in house 1 and the daffodils are in house 2.

Since the person with the computer is to the left of the person with loafers, the computer must be in house 1 and the loafers in house 2.

That means the lilies have to be in house 1!

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

There are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.  

Hmm, some clues tell us exactly where things are, like the person with apples lives in house number 3. And someone with carnations is in house number 1.

Other clues are like puzzles, like the one about the person who ate fried rice living next to the apples.

I think we need to write down all the clues and then try to figure out where everything else goes. It's like a big matching game!

...

*Thinking really hard*

...

Okay, I think I got it!  The person who had pizza lives in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I think the best way to do this is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, maybe make a little chart or something.

Then we can use the clues to figure out where everything goes.  It's like a big matching game!

Hmmm... I'm gonna need to think about this one for a bit.  Lots of clues to keep track of! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the pianist lives.  

Let's see... the pianist lives next to the kiwi eater, and there's someone else between the violinist and the kiwi eater.  Also, the flutist is somewhere to the right of the violinist.

Hmm... that means the violinist can't be in the last house, right?  

So it's gotta be like this: Violinist, then kiwi eater, then pianist.

That means the pianist lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we know a few things:

* House 1 has the kiwi eater.
* The fantasy book person doesn't live in house 1.

That means the fantasy book person *must* live in house 2!

**Answer: (B) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who likes red and what house they live in.  

Let's see... it says the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. And the grilled cheese eater is in the last house. Oh! And the red lover is in the third house!

So the answer is (D) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house. One's a pianist, one plays the cello. One loves root beer, one loves tea.

The first clue says the root beer person doesn't live in house number 2. So they gotta be in house number 1!

The second clue says the pianist lives right next to the cellist. Since there are only two houses, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist in house 2.

So the answer is (A) 1. 

"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the lilies are.  Let's see...

* We know carnations are in the last house, house number 5.
* And boots are right next to the carnations, so they must be in house 4.
*  The tulips are somewhere to the right of the daffodils, but not in house 4.
* Oh, and the tulips are also to the left of the loafers!

Hmmm... I think the daffodils have to be in house 1, then running shoes in house 2, and lilies in house 3. That way, the tulips can be in house 2 and the loafers in house 4.

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

It's like a big matching game. We gotta figure out who lives where and what they like.

Hmmm... I think the best way is to start with the clues that tell us about where people live. Like, clue number one says the blue lover and the apple eater have two houses between them.

Then we gotta look for clues that connect other things, like clue three that says the water drinker lives to the right of the white lover.

It's gonna take some time, but if we keep going clue by clue, we can figure it out!

Oh, and the question wants to know where the pianist lives.  I'll keep an eye out for that! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who ate what!

Let's see...

* We know the person in the first house likes white.
* The person in the second house likes green.
* And someone has to have boots, someone has high heels, and someone has running shoes.

Oh! The person with high heels can't be in the last house. And the spaghetti eater isn't in the second house.

Hmm... the boots person is right next to the high heels person, and the boots person is somewhere before the stew eater.

That means the stew eater must be in the last house!

So, if the stew eater is last, and the spaghetti eater isn't in the second house, the fried rice eater has to be in the second house!

**Answer: (A) 2** 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the rose bouquet is in the second house.  And the science fiction fan has to be next to the rose bouquet.  So the science fiction fan is in house 1 or 3.

But the fantasy book person has to be to the left of the science fiction person, so the science fiction person can't be in house 1. That means they're in house 3!

The romance book lover is to the right of the carnations, and they're also right next to the tulips. So the tulips must be in house 4, and the romance book lover is in house 3.

That means the carnations are in house 2.

Since the other houses are filled, the lilies have to be in house 4!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so we know a few things:

* House 1 has the science fiction fan because that's what the clues say.
* The coffee drinker lives in the house before the person with sandals.

Since house 1 is first, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 and the sandal person is in house 2. That means the romance book lover has to be in house 2!

**Answer: (B) 2** 



"
"Okay, so we know there are two houses, and each person inside is different. One plays the piano, one plays drums, one has a radio, and one has a phone.

The clue says the drummer lives right next to the person with the radio.  That means the drummer must be in house number 1, and the radio is in house number 2.

Since they each have something different, the person in house 1 must have the phone!

So the answer is (A) 1. 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the convertible is in the middle house, right? That's clue number one.

Then, clue two says the white lover and the sedan person have one house between them.  So they can't be in the first and last houses.

And clue three says the yellow lover is right next to the sedan person, on the left side.

Hmmm... putting it all together, the yellow lover has to be in the first house! 

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person with horses lives.  There are a bunch of clues about shoes, cars, and pets.

Hmm, it says the person with running shoes lives in the first house. And the person with a sedan lives in the third house.

Oh! It also says the dog person doesn't live in the third house. And the bird person lives somewhere after the running shoe person, but not right next door.

Let me think...  I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person with horses lives in house **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... there are five houses, and each person has different stuff like flowers, cars, and pets. We gotta use the clues to figure out who lives where.

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, we know the convertible is in the first house and the loafers are in the second house. Oh, and the bird keeper is in the first house too!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  It's gonna take some time to put all the pieces together, but I bet I can do it!

...

*Thinking really hard and scribbling on paper*

...

Okay, I think I got it! The truck is in house **(C) 5**! 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the fried rice person lives in the middle house because clue 3 says so.  And clue 4 says the fantasy book person is also in the middle house. So, they must be the same person!

Clue 1 says the spaghetti person is to the left of the fried rice person, so they must be in the first house.

That means the science fiction fan is in the first house too, because clue 2 says the fried rice person is to the right of them.

That leaves the last house for the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater.

So the answer is (C)! 



"
"Okay, so we know there are two houses, one with tulips and one with carnations. One person has a dog and the other has horses.

The clue says the carnations are to the left of the dog owner.  That means the carnations must be in house number 1! 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person wearing high heels lives in.

We know the kiwi eater is in house number 2.  And the water drinker is right next to the high heel wearer.  

That means the high heel wearer has to be in house number 2 too!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  They each have different stuff, like a TV or a phone, and they like different things, like tea or water.

Here's what I figured out:

* The person with the high heels lives in the house before the person with the sandals.
* The person eating grapes lives right next to the person with the sandals.
* The tea drinker lives in the house before the person with the TV.

So, if we put it all together, the person with the TV has to be eating kiwis!  

That means the kiwi eater is in **House 2**. 

(A) 2
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.  The violinist can't be in the last house, and the water drinker lives to the right of the cellist.  

Since the violinist and guitarist have to have a house between them, the violinist has to be in the first house and the guitarist must be in the last house.

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the person in the third house wears sandals and likes milk.  The person who drinks water lives right next to the sandal wearer, so they must be in house number 4.

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we have these five houses and people with different stuff and they ate different lunches.  Let's see...

* We know Pizza is in house number 4.
* Grilled Cheese is right before Spaghetti, so Spaghetti is in house 4 too!

That means the answer is **(A) 4**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I think the best way to do this is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, maybe make a chart or something.

Then we can use the clues to figure out who lives where.  It's like a big matching game!

Hmmm... I'm gonna need to think about this one for a bit.  Lots of clues to sort through! 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people. One plays guitar and the other plays drums. One ate pizza and one ate grilled cheese. One has a dog and one has a bird.

The clues tell us the grilled cheese person lives to the right of the bird person, and the drummer doesn't live in the second house.

Hmm... that means the drummer must live in the first house, right?  If not, the bird person would have to be in the second house, and then the grilled cheese person would be to the right of them, which doesn't work.

So, the drummer is in house 1, and that means the pizza person is also in house 1!

**Answer: (B) 1** 



"
"The bird keeper lives in house number **3**. Clue number 2 tells us that straight up! 🐦🏠  



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives.  There are three houses, and we have clues about who lives where and what they like.

Hmm, lots of clues about who's where and what they like...  

* The cat lover is in the first house.
*  Some people can't be in the second house.

Let me think...  I'm gonna need to draw a little picture to keep track of everything.

...

Okay, after looking at all the clues, I think the science fiction book fanatic lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the grape person is in house number 2.  And the red person has to be to the right of the kiwi person.  Also, the green and red people live next to each other, and the white person is one house away from both the red and banana people.

Hmmm... that means the kiwi person has to be in house 1!  

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a bunch of stuff about these two people: what they ate, their pets, what fruit they like, what books they read, and what shoes they wear.

The clues tell us some important things:

* The running shoe person lives to the right of the orange eater.
* The mystery book reader lives right next to the cat lover.
* The mystery book reader and the stew eater are neighbors.

Since the running shoe person has to be to the right of the orange eater, and the stew eater is next to the mystery book reader, the stew eater can't be in the second house.  That means the stew eater must be in the first house!

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know a few things:

* The water drinker is in the middle house.
* The root beer lover is in the first house.
* The daffodils are right next to the phone.
* The TV isn't in the middle house.
* The TV is to the right of the tulips.

Hmm... so the root beer lover is in house 1, and the water drinker is in house 2. That means the phone and daffodils must be in house 3!

Since the TV is to the right of the tulips, the tulips must be in house 1 and the TV in house 3.

That leaves house 1 for the milk drinker!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is kinda like a puzzle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the computer is.  There are three houses, and each person is different.  

Hmm, let me think...

* The loafers guy is in the first house.
* The phone person is somewhere before the mango eater.
* Grapes are next to the water drinker.
* Boots aren't in the last house.
* Kiwis aren't in the first house, and they're next to the milk drinker.
* Boots are somewhere after the gameboy person.

Okay, I think I got it!  If you draw it all out, you can see that the computer person is in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We have three houses and three people, each with a sport, flowers, and a pet.  Here's what we know:

* The golfer doesn't live in the last house.
* The fish person lives somewhere before the horse person.
* The golfer and baseball player live right next to each other.
* The carnations and horse person live right next to each other.
* The carnations are somewhere before the baseball player.
* The roses are right before the daffodils.
* The cricketer doesn't live in the last house.

Hmm... let me draw some houses...

Okay, I think the horse person has to be in the last house because the fish person is before them, and the golfer and baseball player have to be together.

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who lives where and what they're doing.

* We know the first house has the orange eater.
* The last house has the horse person.
* The truck has to be next to the convertible.

Since the horse person is in the last house, the truck can't be there.  And the convertible can't be in the last house either because it has to be next to the truck.  That means the truck has to be in the middle house!

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the percussionist lives. There are a bunch of clues about who lives next to who and what they like.

Hmm, let me think...

* The percussionist is to the left of the stew eater.
* The percussionist is also to the right of the mystery book reader.
* And the guitarist is right next to the percussionist.

I think the percussionist must live in house number **4**. That way, the mystery reader is in house 3, the guitarist is in house 2, and the stew eater is in house 5.

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

I think the best way to do this is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, maybe make a chart or something.

Then we can use the clues to fill in the blanks.  It's like a detective game!

Hmmm... I'm gonna need some paper and a pencil for this one.  

*grabs paper and pencil and starts scribbling*

Okay, I think I got it!  The person eating mangos lives in house number **(A) 5**. 



"
"Okay, this puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I can figure it out!

Let's see... we have five houses and five people, each with a favorite color, an instrument, and a gadget.  We gotta match them all up using the clues.

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, clue 7 says the person who likes green lives in the third house, and clue 10 says the radio is also in the third house. So, green and the radio are together!

Then there's clue 1, which says the percussionist and guitarist live next to each other. And clue 8 says the percussionist is next to the person who likes white.

Oh, and clue 3 says the TV is right next to the person who likes red!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.  

*writes furiously on a piece of paper*

Okay, I think I got it! After looking at all the clues, I figured out that the saxophonist lives in house number 1.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses and two people.  They like different stuff, right?

Let's see... the cellist has to be somewhere before the mystery book reader, and the history buff is before the cat lover.  

Oh, and the root beer lover and the guitarist live right next to each other!

Hmm... that's tricky.  I can't figure out for sure if the horse person is in house 1 or house 2.  It could be either one! 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the tulips are.  

Let's see... the carnations are to the right of the bird, so the bird can't be in the last house. And the dog isn't in the middle house. That means the dog must be in the first house!

If the dog is first, the tulips have to be after that, so they can't be in the first house either.  That leaves the tulips in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person wearing loafers lives. There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta be careful.

Hmm, some clues tell us where things are in relation to other things. Like, high heels are somewhere to the left of tulips, and the swimmer lives in the last house.

We also know loafers aren't in the second or third house.

I think the best way to do this is to try and fill in a chart, like a detective! We can write down each house and then try to figure out who lives there based on the clues.

It's gonna take some time, but I bet we can crack this!

(After some time spent working on the puzzle)

Okay, I think I got it! The person wearing loafers lives in **house 1**. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the mango person lives in house number 1.  And the horse person can't live in house 1 or 2.  

The banana person is right next to the dog person, and the banana person can't be in house 3. So the banana person must be in house 2 and the dog person in house 3!

The bird person and the kiwi person live next to each other, and the horses have to be in house 4. That means the bird person must be in house 3!


So the answer is (D) 3.
"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the mystery reader lives in the first house.  The romance person can't be in the last house, and neither can the horse person.

The bird person has to be right next to the history buff.  So, the bird person must be in the second house and the history buff in the third.

That means the romance person has to be in the second house!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the coffee drinker lives.  

We know the coffee drinker is in the second house because it says so right in the clues!

So the answer is (D) 2. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the banana eater is in.  

Clue number 12 says straight up that the banana eater lives in house number **3**. 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who has the carnations!  

Let's see... there are three houses, and each person is different.  

We know the soccer player is in the middle house, house number 2.

And we have all these clues about shoes, books, food, flowers, and sports.

It's like a puzzle!

If we look at all the clues carefully, we can figure out where everyone lives and what they like.

After looking at all the clues, I think the person with the carnations lives in house number 1.

So the answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.  There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* The phone person lives to the left of the minivan person.
* The truck and gameboy people live right next to each other.
* The minivan and cellist people live right next to each other too.
* The high heels and television people are neighbors.
* The minivan is to the right of the truck.
* The flutist lives right next to the minivan.
* The boots person lives to the right of the percussionist.

Hmm, that's a lot to keep track of! Let me try drawing it out...

Okay, so the truck has to be before the minivan, and the gameboy is right next to the truck.  And the minivan and cellist are together.  

That means it has to be like this:

Truck - Gameboy - Minivan - Cellist

Oh! And the phone has to be before the minivan too. So the phone person is in the first house!

The flutist is before the minivan, so they must be in the second house.

And the high heels and television people have to be together somewhere.

The boots person is to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist can't be in the last house.

That means the percussionist must be in the **first house**!



So the answer is (C).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house has the apple eater.  There are a bunch of clues, but some are easier than others.

We know right off the bat that the person with the daffodils is in house number 2, and the grape eater is in house number 5.  Oh, and the apple eater is in house number 4!

So the answer is **(A) 4**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know the lily person is in the middle house, house number 2.  

The clues say the coffee person is right next to the rose person, and the SUV person is also right next to the coffee person.  

Since the lily person is in the middle, that means the coffee person has to be in house number 3!


So the answer is (C).
"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who drives the truck.  Let's see...

There are three houses, and each person is different. One has a minivan, one a truck, and one a convertible.  They also ate different stuff for lunch and like different colors.

The clues are kinda like a puzzle.

* Clue 1 says the blue lover lives right next to the spaghetti eater.
* Clue 2 says the stew eater lives somewhere to the left of the lilies.
* Clue 3 says the rose person lives right next to the truck driver.
* Clue 4 says the minivan person lives right next to the stew eater.
* Clue 5 says the red lover doesn't live in the first house.
* Clue 6 says the minivan person lives right next to the daffodil person.

Hmm... if the minivan is next to the stew eater, and the stew eater is left of the lilies, then the minivan must be in the first house, stew in the second, and lilies in the third.

And since the rose person is next to the truck driver, the rose must be in the first house and the truck in the second.

So the truck driver lives in **House 2 (B)**! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

There are a bunch of clues, so we gotta be careful.  

Hmm, some clues are easier than others. Like, we know the soccer player is in house number 2, and the basketball player is in house number 4. Oh, and the flutist is in house 3!

We also know the person who likes white lives in house 4, and they drive an SUV.

Let's see... the person who eats spaghetti is somewhere to the left of the saxophonist, and the person who eats stew is right next to the person who eats pizza.

Oh! And the person who likes red lives right next to the person who drives a sedan.

I think if we keep looking at the clues and how they fit together, we can figure out where the sedan is.

I'm gonna say the sedan is in **(A) 1**. 



"
"Okay, so let's figure this out!

We know a few things for sure:

* The gameboy is in the third house.
* The person who likes red is in the second house.
* Grapes are to the right of red, so they must be in the third house.
* White is to the left of grapes, so they must be in the first house.

That means the phone has to be in the first house too, because it's right next to the running shoes, and the third house is already taken.

So the answer is (C) 1! 



"
"Okay, so the bird keeper lives in the second house. That's clue number one!  

So the answer is (C) 2. 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out who's eating mangos.  Let's see...

We know the sax player is in house number 1. And the grape eater is right next to the tea drinker AND the baseball player.  That means house 1 has to be the sax player, tea drinker, and grape eater.

Since the golfer is next to the sax player, they must be in house 1 too. And the romance book lover is next to the golfer, so they're in house 1 as well!

That means house 2 has to have the mango eater and the science fiction fan.

So the answer is (A) 2! 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Okay, so we have five houses and five people. Each person likes different stuff: fruit, music, shoes, colors, and books. We gotta figure out where the romance book lover lives.

There are a bunch of clues, so let's see...

* Some clues tell us where things are directly next to each other, like the person who likes green lives right next to the person who likes blue.
* Other clues tell us how many houses apart things are, like the pianist lives two houses away from the person wearing sandals.

We gotta use all the clues together to figure it out. It's like a big puzzle!

I'm gonna try drawing a little chart to keep track of everything.

...

*Looks intensely at imaginary chart, scribbling with a pencil*

Okay, I think I got it!  The romance book lover lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so the person with the boots lives in the first house. That's what clue number 3 says! 

So the answer is (A) 1. 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  

Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.  

I think the best way to do this is to write down all the stuff we know about each house. Like, maybe make a chart or something.

Then we can use the clues to figure out who lives where. It's like a detective game!

Hmmm... I'm gonna need some paper and a pencil for this one.  

*grabs paper and pencil and starts scribbling*

Okay, I think I got it! The tea drinker lives in house number **(D) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person who likes green lives. There are a bunch of clues about drinks, flowers, food, and colors.

It's like a puzzle! We gotta match everything up.

Hmmm... I think the best way is to start with the clues that tell us exactly where something is.

Like, we know the tea drinker is in house number 1, and the tulips are in house number 5.

Then we gotta use the other clues to figure out the rest. It's like a chain reaction!

...

Okay, after looking at all the clues really carefully, I think the person who likes green lives in **house number 3**. 

So the answer is **(B)**! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

* One likes red, one likes yellow.
* One eats oranges, one eats grapes.
* One reads mysteries, one reads fantasy.
* One drives a truck, one drives a convertible.
* One wears boots, one wears running shoes.

And here are the clues:

1. The grape eater lives to the left of the truck driver.
2. The boots wearer lives to the left of the mystery reader.
3. The yellow lover lives to the left of the truck driver.

Hmm... let me see...

It looks like the yellow lover, grape eater, and truck driver are all in a row. And the boots wearer is somewhere before the mystery reader.

But, I can't figure out exactly where the fantasy reader is!  There isn't enough info. 



"
"Okay, this is a tough one!  Let's see... there are a lot of clues, so we gotta be careful.

So the answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out!

We know the basketball player and violinist are the same person because they both live in the second house.  

The cellist has to live to the right of the cricketer, so the cricketer can't be in the last house.

The daffodils are somewhere before the minivan, and apples are before the daffodils.  Tulips are before the convertible.

The sedan is somewhere after the carnations. And there's one house between the carnations and the lilies.

Oh, and grapes aren't in the last house!

...

Okay, I think I got it!  

The sedan is in house **(A) 3**.
