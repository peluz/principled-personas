"Okay, let's see...

We know the flutist lives in the second house.  And the tulips have to be next to the guitarist.  The lilies are next to the carnations too.  Hmm...

If the pianist is in the first house, there's no room for the tulips to be next to the guitarist. So the pianist must be in the third house! That means the lilies are in the second house, and the carnations are in the fourth house.

That leaves the tulips for the first house!

So the answer is (C)! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the green lover lives in the first house and eats kiwis.

"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and everyone in them is different! One has a gameboy, one has a phone, and one has a computer.  They also have different flowers, play different music things, have different pets, and like different books.

"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house.

One wears sandals, one wears boots. One likes mystery books, one likes history books. One drives a convertible, one drives a truck.

Hmm... the convertible person lives next to the history book lover. And the boots person doesn't live in the first house.

So, the sandals person must be in the first house!

**Answer: (A) 1**

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"This is a tricky one!  Let's see...

We gotta figure out who has the sedan.  There are lots of clues about who likes what and where they live.

The truck is next to the person with sandals, and the loafers are somewhere before the truck.  Boots are also before the truck.

Oh! The truck can't be in house number 4 because the white-liking person is there.

Let me think...  

I think the person wearing boots lives in house number **(A) 2**.

"Okay, so we know there are two houses. One person has a computer and the other has a TV. One person has lilies and the other has roses.

The clues tell us the TV person is in house number 1, and the lilies are NOT in house number 1. That means the lilies must be in house number 2!  If house 1 has the TV, then house 2 must have the computer.

So the answer is (A) 2.

"Okay, so we gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.

Let's see... the science fiction book person lives to the left of the golfer.  And the pizza eater and the history book person live right next to each other. Oh, and the guitarist lives to the right of the daffodils.

That leaves the last house for the water person and the root beer person.

So the root beer person lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the person in the first house ate spaghetti.  The fried rice person can't be in the middle house, and the boots person has to be right next to them. So the fried rice person must be in the last house and the boots person is in the middle house.

Whew! That's a lot to think about.  

Let me see... the pizza person must live in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

The baseball player lives in house number 2, and they also drive a cool convertible!  The person eating grapes can't live in house number 1, so they must live in house number 2 too. That means the mango eater has to live in house number 1!

So the answer is (B) 1. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person likes a different color and eats a different fruit.  

Hmm... the blue person is in the middle house. And the kiwi eater is in the last house.  The apple eater is right next to the orange eater. Oh! And the white lover is to the right of the green lover.

That means the white lover must be in the last house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One is number 1 and the other is number 2.  

There are some clues to help us figure out who lives where and what they like.

Clue number one says the person who likes root beer lives in the house to the right of the house with the roses. So, the roses must be in house number 1!

That means the root beer person is in house number 2.

The answer is (A)! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are four houses, right? And each one has a person with a different pet and car.

Hmm... the minivan is on the far right, next to the fish person. And the truck is right next to the sedan.  The fish person is right next to the dog person.

Oh! I know! The dog person must live in house number 3! 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the root beer lover is in the second house. And the yellow lover is in the third house.  The blue lover has to be to the right of the yellow lover, so they must be in the fourth house!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person in them is different.  One likes oranges, one likes grapes, and one likes mangos.  One plays basketball, one plays baseball, and one plays cricket.  

Hmm... the clues say the cricket player lives to the right of the orange eater. And the baseball player is to the left of the cat lover.

Oh! The person who likes blue lives in the middle house!

Let me think... think... think...

Okay, I figured it out! The bird keeper lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

There are five houses, and everyone in them is different.  They like different foods, drinks, pets, and sports, and they play different instruments.

One plays guitar, one plays the cello. One has a computer, one has a gameboy. One has a dog, one has fish.

The cello player is right next to the gameboy person. And the dog person doesn't live in the first house.

Hmmm... that means the dog person must live in the second house!

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are four houses, right? And each one has a person with a different car and a different thing like a phone or a game.

Hmm... the gameboy is in the third house. And the minivan is in the first house.

The phone is next to the SUV, so the SUV can't be in the first house.  The radio is after the gameboy, so it's in the last house.

That means the SUV has to be in the second house!


So the answer is (D).
"
"Okay, let's see... there are five houses in a row, and each one has a different flower and a different thing like a game or a phone.

We gotta figure out where the person with the carnations lives.

There are five houses, and everyone has a pet, plays a sport, and wears different shoes.  

We know the cricketer lives in the second house, and the golfer lives in the fourth. The fish person also lives in the second house. The bird person lives in the first house.

Oh! The loafers are next to the cricketer, and the sandals are one house away from the bird person.

The baseball player is after the sandals, and the cat person is after the golfer.

And the horse person is one house away from the boots person.

Let me think...  

I think the dog person lives in house number **3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know two people live in houses next to each other. One likes root beer, the other likes water. One eats a banana, the other eats grapes. One had pizza, the other had stew. One drives a truck, the other a minivan. And one has a radio, the other has a computer!

Hmm... the radio person and the truck person live next to each other. And the radio person is somewhere to the left of the pizza person. Oh, and the root beer lover doesn't live in the first house.  Also, the grape eater is right next to the computer person.

Let me think... if the radio and truck are together, and the radio is before the pizza, then the pizza person must be in the second house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are five houses and lots of clues about who lives where and what they like.

Then we can use the other clues to see who lives next to who. It's like a puzzle where we have to fit all the pieces together.

I'm gonna try drawing a picture of the houses and write down all the clues. Maybe if I look at it carefully, I can figure out where the lilies are!

Okay, I think the answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the soccer player is in the last house. And the tulips aren't in the last house.  

The golfer is next to the basketball player, so they're in the first two houses.

The lilies are right next to the grilled cheese, so the grilled cheese can't be in the first house.

That means the grilled cheese must be in the second house!

Oh! Clue number 4 says the boots are right next to the computer!  

Let me think...  

*The computer is in house number 2!*

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Hmm, let's see...

The person who likes science fiction can't be in the house on the right because the fried rice eater is on the right side of them. So the science fiction person must be in house number 1!


Answer: (B) 1 

"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the pianist lives in the first house. And the person who likes horses can't live in the second house because the root beer lover has to be to their right. So the horse person must be in the first house too!

The person who ate pizza is in the first house, and the dog owner lives next to them. So the dog owner must live in the second house!

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the history book person lives in house number 1. And the cat person doesn't live in house number 2.

The high heels are to the left of the daffodils, so the high heels must be in house 1 and the daffodils in house 2.

The loafers are to the right of the computer, so the computer is in house 1 and the loafers in house 2.

That means the lilies have to be in house 1!


So the answer is (B) 1. 

"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

There are five houses, and everyone in them likes different things. We gotta figure out who ate pizza.

Hmm... some clues say where people live, like the apple eater is in house number 3. And some clues say who lives next to who.

It's like a puzzle! We gotta put all the clues together like puzzle pieces.

I think the answer is **(D) 4**. 



"
"This is a tricky one!  Let's see... there are four houses and lots of clues about the people who live there.  We gotta figure out where the cellist lives. Hmmm...

I think the best way is to draw four boxes, one for each house. Then we can write down what we know about each house.

It's like a puzzle! We gotta use all the clues to figure it out.  

...

Okay, after looking at all the clues really carefully, I think the cellist lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the pianist and the kiwi eater live next to each other. And the flutist is somewhere to the right of the violinist.  Also, the grape eater is one house away from the kiwi eater.

Hmmm... if the violinist is in the first house, the kiwi eater and pianist would have to be in the next two houses. That wouldn't leave room for the flutist to be to the right of the violinist!

So, the violinist must be in the middle house. That means the pianist is in the last house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, so the kiwi person is in house number 1.  And the fantasy book person can't be in house number 1. That means they must be in house number 2!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"The person who likes red lives in house number 3! 

So the answer is (D). 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house. One plays the piano, and the other plays the cello. One likes root beer, and one likes tea.

The first clue says the root beer person doesn't live in the second house. So they must live in the first house! 

The answer is (A). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are five houses, and everyone has different shoes and flowers.  

We know the carnations are in the last house, and the boots are right next to them.  The tulips are somewhere to the left of the loafers.  And the daffodils are to the left of the tulips.

Hmmm... I think the lilies must be in house number 3! 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are four houses and lots of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

Hmm, I think we need to figure out where everyone is one by one.  It's like a big matching game!

I'm gonna try drawing some houses and writing down the clues. Maybe if I look at it all together, I can figure out where the pianist lives.

...

Okay, I think the pianist lives in house number **(C) 1**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person in them likes different things and eats different food.

We know:

* The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* The person who likes green lives in the second house.
* The person with high heels doesn't live in the last house.
* The person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house.
* The person who ate stew doesn't live in the second house either.
* The person with boots is right next to the person with high heels.
* The person with boots is somewhere before the person who ate stew.

Hmmm... that's a lot to think about!

Let's see... if the person with boots is next to the person with high heels, and the person with high heels isn't in the last house, then the person with boots must be in the first house and the person with high heels is in the second house.

And since the person with boots is before the person who ate stew, the person who ate stew must be in the last house!

That means the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house!

So the answer is (A)! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are four houses, right? And each one has a different flower and a person who likes a different kind of book.

Hmm... the rose bouquet is in the second house. And the science fiction person is next to the roses. So the science fiction person must be in house one!

The romance person is next to the tulips, and the tulips are in the last house. So the romance person is in the third house.

Oh! The carnations are to the left of the romance person, so they must be in the second house.

That means the lilies have to be in the last house!

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, so we know the science fiction person lives in house number 1.  And the coffee drinker is in the house before the sandals person.  That means the coffee drinker is in house 1 too!  So the romance book lover must be in house number 2.

Answer: (B) 2 

"
"Okay, so there are two houses, right? One person in each house. One plays music with a piano, and the other bangs on stuff like drums! One has a radio, and one has a phone.

The clue says the drummer is right next to the person with the radio, on the left side. So the drummer is in house number 1, and the radio is in house number 2.

That means the phone has to be in house number 1! 

So the answer is (A) 1. 

"
"Okay, let's see...

The convertible is in the middle house, right? And the yellow person lives next to the sedan person.  Hmmm...  If the yellow person is next to the sedan person, and the convertible is in the middle, then the yellow person must be in the first house!

So the answer is (A).

Okay, I think the person with horses lives in house **(C) 4**. 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one!  Let's see...

There are five houses, and everyone has different stuff.  We gotta figure out where the truck driver lives.

Hmm, lots of clues!

Okay, that's a start!

Let me think...  

* The person with the lilies lives somewhere before the cat lover.
* The loafers and the kiwi eater are next to each other.
* The rose bouquet is right before the lilies.

Oh, and the tulips are before the boots!

This is like a puzzle! I gotta keep looking at the clues and see if I can figure out where everything goes.

...

*Thinking really hard*

...

Okay, I think I got it! The truck driver lives in house number **(C) 5**. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the fried rice person lives in the middle house 'cause it says so! And the fantasy book person is also in the middle house.  That means the spaghetti person must be in the first house, and the science fiction person is in the first house too.

That leaves the last house for the mystery book person and the grilled cheese person. So the answer is (C)! 



"
"The person with the carnations lives in house number 1 because they live to the left of the person with the dog.  

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Okay, so we gotta figure out which house the person with high heels lives in.

We know the kiwi eater is in house number 2. And the water drinker is right next to the high heel wearer.  

Hmmm... that means the high heel wearer must be in house number 2 too!

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know some stuff about the people in the houses:

* One has a TV and one has a phone.
* One wears sandals and one wears high heels.
* One likes tea and one likes water.
* One eats kiwis and one eats grapes.

Hmm... the clues say:

1. High heels are somewhere to the left of sandals.
2. Grapes and sandals are right next to each other.
3. The tea drinker is to the left of the person with the TV.

Let me think... if high heels are before sandals, and grapes are with sandals, it must be high heels, then grapes, then sandals!

And the tea drinker has to be before the TV person...

So, I think the kiwi eater must be in **House 2**! 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the tea drinker lives in the first house.  The violinist can't be in the last house. And the water drinker lives to the right of the cellist.

Hmmm... if the violinist isn't last, and there has to be a house between the violinist and the guitarist, then the violinist must be in the first house and the guitarist in the last house!

So the answer is (C) 3. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

The person with sandals lives in the third house, and they also like milk!  The person who drinks water lives right next to them, so they must be in house number four.

So the answer is (B)!

*keeps scribbling and muttering to themself*

Aha! I think I got it! The person who eats the banana lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each house.

One person plays drums, and the other plays guitar. One ate pizza, and one ate grilled cheese. One has a dog, and one has a bird.

Hmm... the grilled cheese person lives to the right of the bird person. And the drummer doesn't live in the second house.

That means the drummer must live in the first house!  If the bird person isn't in the second house, they must be in the first house too.

So, the pizza person must be in the first house!

**Answer: (B) 1** 

"
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3!  üê¶üè†  That's what clue number 2 says. 



"

Hmm... if red is to the right of kiwi, and green and red are together, then kiwi must be in the first house! 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Okay, let's see...

The person with running shoes has to be on the right side of the person eating oranges.  And the mystery book reader lives right next to the person who likes cats.  The mystery book reader also lives next to the person who ate stew.

Hmm... that means the stew eater can't be in the house on the right! There wouldn't be room for the running shoes person.

So the stew eater must be in house number 1!


**Answer: (B)** 

"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and each person is different.  

We know the water drinker is in the middle house. And the root beer lover is in the first house.

The daffodils are next to the phone, so the daffodils must be in the middle house and the phone is in the last house.

The TV is on the right side of the tulips, so the tulips must be in the first house and the TV is in the last house.

That means the milk drinker must be in the first house!

So the answer is (A) 3. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

There are three houses, and everyone in them is different! One wears loafers, one wears running shoes, and one wears boots. One likes water, one likes tea, and one likes milk. One eats kiwis, one eats grapes, and one eats mangos. And one has a gameboy, one has a computer, and one has a phone.

We gotta figure out who has the computer!

Hmm... the person with loafers lives in the first house. And the phone person is somewhere to the left of the mango eater. The grape eater is right next to the water drinker. The boots person doesn't live in the last house, and the kiwi eater doesn't live in the first house.

So the answer is (A) 2. 



"
"Okay, let's see...

"
"Hmm, this is tricky! Let's see...

We know the cellist is somewhere before the mystery book reader, and the history book lover is before the cat lover.  And the root beer lover and the guitarist live right next to each other.

That's a lot to keep track of!  

I think we need more clues to know for sure which house has the horse owner.  Maybe there's a clue about who likes horses? 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know there are three houses, and each person has a different pet and flowers.

The clues tell us:

* The carnations are on the right side of the bird.
* The dog doesn't live in the middle house.
* The tulips are on the right side of the dog.

Hmmm... so the dog can't be in the middle house.  That means the dog must be in the first house!

If the tulips are on the right side of the dog, they must be in the second house!

So the answer is (B)! 



"
"Okay, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the person with loafers lives.  There are clues about what everyone is doing and wearing.

Hmmm... I think we need to look for clues that tell us about the loafers directly.

That means they must be in house 1 or house 4!

Let me think...

(C) 1 



"
"Okay, let's see...

We know the mango person lives in house number 1.  And the horse person can't live in house 1 or 2.  

The banana person is next to the dog person, and the banana person can't be in house 3. So the banana person must be in house 2 and the dog person in house 3!

The bird person and the kiwi person live next to each other, and the horse person is in house 4. That means the bird person must be in house 3!


So the answer is (D) 3.

* The high heels and television people live next to each other.
* The minivan person lives to the right of the truck person.
* The flutist lives to the left of the minivan person.
* The boots person lives to the right of the percussionist person.

Hmm... that's a lot to think about!

Let me see... the minivan person has to be on the right side because the phone person is on the left and the truck person is even further left.  And the cellist lives next to the minivan person.

So, the cellist must be in the last house!

That means the truck person must be in the first house, and the gameboy person is next to them.

The percussionist has to be somewhere before the boots person...

So, the percussionist must live in the first house!

We know the saxophonist lives in the first house. And the grape eater lives next to the tea drinker and the baseball player.  Hmmm... so maybe the first house has the saxophonist, the tea drinker, and the grapes?

Then the baseball player must be in the second house!

Oh! The golfer lives next to the saxophonist, so the golfer is also in the first house. And the romance book lover is next to the golfer, so they're in the first house too!

That means the mango eater must be in the second house!

So the answer is (A). 



"
"This puzzle is tricky!  Let's see... there are five houses and lots of clues about who lives where and what they like.  

Hmm, I think we need to look for clues that tell us exactly where something is. Like, we know the person with running shoes lives in the first house. And the person eating apples is in the fourth house.
