"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... we have three houses and three sets of clues.

* The swimmer lives right next to the daffodil person.

* The tulip person is to the right of the mango eater.

Hmm... thinking, thinking...

The only way to fit all these clues together is:

"

The answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the golfer is in the first house. And the swimmer is right next to the romance reader, but not in the third house. That means they must be in the second and third houses, right?

That means the cat lover has to be in house number one!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is tricky, but Gustavo can help you crack it!

Think of it like this: we need to figure out who lives where and what they like.  We have clues about their pets, favorite books, lunches, colors, and drinks.

It's like a big detective case, but instead of finding a thief, we're finding out who drinks water!

Let's see... those clues are like puzzle pieces. We gotta fit them together just right.

"Ciao! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. That's a pretty straightforward clue!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

Think of it like this: we have five houses in a row, each with a person who likes different things. We need to figure out where the stew-lover lives.

* We know some folks are neighbors: the rose bouquet person lives next to the grilled cheese fan, and the grilled cheese person is right next to the stew eater.

After carefully considering all the clues, I've figured it out! The stew-lover lives in **house number (D) 4**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we have four houses in a row, each with a different person and their quirks.  We need to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

Hmm, let's see... the cat lover is in the first house, that's a good start. And the tulips are right next to the dog owner.  The horse person is somewhere with a bit of space from the carnations.  

Thinking, thinking...

Aha! I've got it! The fish enthusiast must be in **House 4 (D)**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the phone is in the first house. And the boots are *not* in the second house, so they must be in the first house too.  

The horse person and the radio person are right next to each other. Since the phone is in the first house, the horse and radio must be in the first and second houses.

That means the high heels have to be in the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Okay, I think I got it!

"
"Ay, caramba! This is a tricky one! Let's see...

The tennis player is right next to the cat lover, so they must be in the first and second houses.  

The bird keeper can't be in the first or third house, so they must be in the fourth house.

Let me see... the dog owner has to be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast in the second.

That leaves the cat lover in the third house.

So the answer is **(C) 4**.  The bird keeper lives in house number 4.  



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

* The kiwi lover is in house number one.
* The truck isn't in house one or three.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun little mystery. Let's see...

The fried rice eater is in the third house, and the spaghetti eater is right next door.  That puts the spaghetti eater in the second house.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa – lots of ingredients, needs careful mixing!

Let me see... five houses, five folks, and a whole lotta stuff to keep track of.  

*Each house has a different gadget, pet, musical instrument, car, and flowers.*

Putting it all together... the truck driver must be in **house number 2**.

So the answer is **(D)**! 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We know the tea drinker is in the first house. And the apples are to the left of the minivan, which is in the third house.  That means the apples must be in the second house.

Now, the fantasy book lover and the coffee drinker are one house apart.  Since the oranges aren't in the second house, they must be in the first house with the tea drinker.

That leaves the coffee drinker in the second house!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the red lover is in the middle house, right? And the mystery reader is next door to them. That means the mystery reader is in the last house.  

The white lover can't be in the last house, so they must be in the first one.  And since the fantasy reader can't be in the first house, they must be in the house in the beginning!

So the answer is **(C) 1**.

Let's see... the SUV owner lives in the third house. That's clue number 5, very straightforward!

Easy peasy!

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know a lot about these neighbors! One eats spaghetti, the other fried rice. One plays the flute, the other the cello. One wears loafers, the other sandals. One loves white, the other green. And one drives a sedan, the other an SUV.

* The fried rice eater isn't in the first house.

Hmm... putting it all together, the sandal wearer must be in **House 2 (B)**. 



"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to solve this puzzle! Let's see... three houses, lots of clues... *strokes chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I'm picturing it like this:

We know the root beer lover is in the third house.  And the water drinker can't be in the first house, but they live next to the minivan owner.  That means the water drinker must be in the second house and the minivan owner in the third!

Now, the sedan is always to the left of the daffodils, and the sedan is also to the left of the apples, which are to the left of the violinist.  So it's gotta be Sedan - Daffodils - Apples - Violinist!

*taps pencil on table*

I'm seeing the violinist in house number **(A) 2**. 




"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's see...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

After carefully considering all the clues, I, Gustavo, have determined the answer.

The person wearing loafers lives in house number **(B) 4**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

We know the person with the television is in the first house. And the lilies aren't in the first house either.  That means the computer must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle. Let me see...

* We know the science fiction fan is to the left of the golfer, so they can't be in House 2.
* The pizza lover and history buff are neighbors.
* And the guitarist lives to the right of the daffodils.

Hmm... that means the daffodils must be in House 1, and the guitarist in House 2!

So, the percussionist must be in **House 1**. 

The answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

We gotta figure out where the percussionist lives.  

* We know the violinist is in house number four and the bird keeper is in house number five.

* The guitarist is to the left of the gameboy player, and the television is to the left of the gameboy.

* The flutist is right next to the television, and the phone is a couple of houses away from the horses.

* Oh, and the fish enthusiast and the horse owner are neighbors!

* The dog owner isn't in house number two.

After thinking it over, I'm pretty sure the percussionist is in **house number 2**. 

So the answer is **(B)**.  



"
"Ciao! This is a fun one! Let's see...

We know the lilies are in the first house. And the basketball player can't be in the first house.  The radio has to be to the right of both the apples and the violinist. That means the violinist must be in the first house! 

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see... five houses, five sports, five lunches...

* The tennis player is in house number three, that's a good start.
* And the grilled cheese lover is in house number five.
* The golfer is chilling in house number four.

Now, the fried rice and spaghetti folks have to be separated by one house.  Hmmm... and the pizza eater is somewhere before the cricketer.  The stew eater is right next to the spaghetti lover.  And the tennis player is to the left of the soccer player...

Let me think... think... think...

Aha! I got it! The cricketer is in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we have two houses, right? One person in each.  They each like different things.  

Hmm... the running shoes aren't in the first house, and the baseball player is right next to the spaghetti lover.  That means the baseball player must be in house number two, and the spaghetti lover is in house number one.

The person who likes white lives next to the spaghetti lover, so they must be in house number one too. And the water drinker is next to the spaghetti lover, so they're in house number two.

Let's see... we know house one has white, stew, and water. House two has red, spaghetti, milk, and baseball.

That means the loafers must be in house number one!

**Answer: (B)** 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the coffee drinker is somewhere to the left of the mango lover, and the water drinker is to the right of the root beer lover.  

Hmm... the root beer lover can't be in the middle house, and neither can the orange eater. That means the mango lover must be in the middle house!

If the mango lover is in the middle, the coffee drinker has to be in the first house. That leaves the last house for the water drinker and the root beer lover.

So the answer is **(C) 3**.  



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the person in the first house ate spaghetti.  And the fried rice eater can't be in the second house.  

Hmm... the boots wearer is right next to the fried rice eater, so they can't be in the first house either. That means the fried rice eater must be in the last house, and the boots wearer is in the middle house.

Since the loafers wearer isn't in the first house, they must be in the middle house too!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this puzzle is tricky, but Gustavo can help!  

These logic problems, they are like a good plate of paella - lots of ingredients, gotta put them together just right.

First, you gotta make a little chart, see?  Five houses, one for each number. Then you got your categories: car, food, fruit, books, and gadgets.

Now, start lookin' at those clues. Some are easier than others. Like, clue number 11, that tells you right away the science fiction fan is in house number three.  Clue 15, that's a good one too - banana eater is in house number four.

Keep goin', amigo. Look for connections. One clue might tell you someone is to the left or right of another. Use that to fill in your chart.

Don't give up! It takes time, but you'll get there.

Now, where's that mystery book reader? Let me see...

Ah, I got it! The mystery book reader is in house number **(A) 4**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

We gotta figure out where those lilies are hiding.  Think of it like this: each clue is a little ingredient, and we gotta combine them just right to get the answer.

* We know the dog owner is in house number 3, and the tulips are somewhere to the left of them.
*  The root beer lover is chilling in house number 5.
* And remember, the cat lover is always hanging out to the right of the daffodils.

Keep those clues simmering in your mind, and you'll find those lilies in no time!

Now, let me see... after carefully considering all the clues, I'd say the lilies are in house number **(E) 4**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... the mystery reader is in house number 1, and the tennis player is not in house number 1. That means the tennis player must be in house number 2.  

So, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house number 2.

The answer is (B). 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle! Let me see...

*cracks knuckles and pulls out a notepad*

Alright, let's break this down. We have four houses, and each person has a unique combo of instrument, shoes, lunch, flowers, and favorite color.  

*starts scribbling furiously*

Hmm, lots of clues to juggle!  

*taps pencil thoughtfully*

Aha! I think I've got it!

The person who likes white lives in house **(A) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa - needs a little heat to figure it out!

Let me see... four houses, four colors, four drinks, four instruments, four sports...  It's a lot to juggle!

Give me a moment to let my brain simmer on this. I'll need to think about all the clues carefully.

...

Okay, I think I've got it!  The person who only drinks water lives in **House Number (B) 2**. 



"

Let me know if you have any more brain teasers for me!  

"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

You gotta think like a detective, connecting the clues like pieces of a puzzle.  

After carefully studying those clues, I've figured it out! The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this puzzle!

Let's see... we have two houses, two people, and lots of clues.  

* We know the kiwi eater is in house number 1, and the science fiction fan is in house number 2.

* The bird keeper and the high heel wearer are neighbors, so they must be in house 2.

* The tennis player and apple eater are also neighbors, but since the kiwi eater is already in house 1, they must be in house 2.

* The dog owner can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 1.

That leaves the cricketer!  They must be in **house 1**.

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

Think of it like this: each house is a little world, and we gotta figure out who's doing what in each one. We got pets, lunches, sports, and fruits to sort out.

* We know the pizza lover is in the last house, the fifth one.
* And the swimmer is chilling in the second house, munching on oranges.
* The fish enthusiast is in the third house, and the cat lover is right next door in the second.

Now, we gotta use those other clues like breadcrumbs to find the rest. It's like a treasure hunt, but instead of gold, we're looking for the grape eater!

After carefully piecing together all the clues, I've figured it out!

The person eating grapes lives in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

*  The green lover is in the first house, that's a good start.
*  And the fried rice eater is in the last house, number four.

Hmm, let me think... the truck is next to the lilies...  

*  Aha! The truck is in house two, and the lilies are in house three.

Now, the pizza and the roses are neighbors, and the pizza and the apples are neighbors too...

*  This means the pizza must be in house two!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... we have two houses, two people, and lots of clues.  

The baseball player and the convertible driver are the same person, and they live in the second house.  That means the person eating grapes must live in the second house too.

This leaves the first house for the mango lover!

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We know the blue lover is in the middle house, and the kiwi fan is in the last house. That means the green lover must be in the first house.  And since the white lover is to the right of the green lover, they must be in the last house!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the root beer lover is to the right of the rose bouquet. That means the rose bouquet must be in House 1.  

The soccer player is right next to the mystery book reader, and the gameboy is to the left of the mystery book reader.  That means the soccer player must be in House 1, and the mystery book reader in House 2.

So, the rose bouquet is in **House 1 (A)**.  



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We got four houses, right? And each one has a person with a different pet and car.  

* We know the minivan is on the far right, next to the fish lover's house.
* The truck is right next to the sedan.
* And the dog owner lives two houses away from the truck driver.

Hmmm... putting it all together, the dog owner must be in house number 3!

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

The root beer lover is in the second house, and the yellow lover is in the third.  Since the blue lover is to the right of the yellow lover, that means blue must be in the fourth house!

So the answer is **(B) 4**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This sounds like a tricky puzzle! Let's see...  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Okay, I think I've got it!  

The bird keeper lives in house **(B) 3**. 



"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to crack this puzzle for you.  Let's see... five houses, lots of clues... this is going to be fun!

*taps pencil on chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I've got it! The tennis player lives in house number **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa – lots of ingredients to juggle! Let's see... we gotta figure out where that history book buff is hiding.

*cracks knuckles and grabs a pencil*

Okay, so we got houses, sports, fruits, books, and colors.  It's like a fiesta in my brain!

*mumbles to himself, scribbling on a napkin*

Hmm... kiwi next to tennis, mystery to the right of oranges... cricketer left of yellow...  

*eyes widen*

Aha! I think I'm starting to see the pattern!

*continues scribbling furiously*

Let me see... the blue lover is in house 5, and the cricketer is in house 1.  

*taps the napkin with his pencil*

And the history buff...  

*dramatic pause*

...is in house **(A) 3**! 

There you have it, amigo!  Case closed! 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

The cellist is right next to the person with the gameboy, and the dog owner isn't in the first house. That means the dog owner must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the gameboy is in the third house, and the minivan is in the first.  The phone is right next to the SUV, and the radio is somewhere to the right of the gameboy.  

Hmmm... that means the SUV can't be in the first house, and the radio must be in the last house.  

Thinking, thinking...  Aha! The SUV has to be in the second house! 

So the answer is **(D) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

We gotta figure out where the carnations are, right?  

Okay, so the tulips are in the third house, that's a good start. And the computer is in the second house.  

Hmm, the phone is to the left of the TV, and the lilies are to the right of the phone.  

The daffodils are to the right of the radio, but not in the fourth house.

Let me think...

Aha! I got it! The carnations are in the **fifth house (E)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

We gotta figure out where the dog owner lives.  I'm thinking about all the clues, like the cricketer being in the second house and the golfer in the fourth.  

Hmmm... after looking at all the clues carefully, I'm pretty sure the dog owner lives in **House 3**. 

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know a few things. The radio and truck buddies live right next door to each other, and the grapes are right next to the computer.  Also, the radio is somewhere to the left of whoever ate pizza, and the root beer lover isn't in the first house.

Hmmm... putting it all together, it seems like the pizza eater must be in the second house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We got four houses, four folks, and lots of clues.  

* The tea drinker is in the first house, that's easy.
* And the pizza lover is right next door, in house number two.

Now, the milk drinker is somewhere to the left of the spaghetti eater, and the spaghetti eater is to the left of the water drinker.  

Hmmm... and the white lover and the water drinker are right next to each other.

Let me think...

Aha! That means the order must be milk, spaghetti, water, and then white.

Now, the coffee drinker is somewhere to the left of the yellow lover.

And remember, the green lover isn't in the first house, and neither is the grilled cheese eater.

Putting it all together... the green lover must be in house number **3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

We gotta figure out where the red lover is living.  I'm seeing a lot of clues about who lives next to who, and what they like.  

After looking at all the clues carefully, I'm thinking the red lover is in **House 2**.

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa - needs a little time to simmer and the flavors to blend!

Let me see... houses, drinks, fruits, shoes, sports, flowers...  It's a lot to keep track of!

*cracks knuckles and grabs a pencil*

Give me a moment to work my magic. I'll figure out where those lilies are hiding!

...

Alright, I've got it! The person with the lilies lives in house number **(D) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can solve it! Let's see...

The soccer player is in the third house, right? And the tulips aren't in the third house.  That means the tulips must be in either the first or second house.

But wait! The lilies are always to the left of the grilled cheese. So, the grilled cheese can't be in the first house, or there wouldn't be anything to its left!

That means the grilled cheese must be in the second house. 

So the answer is **(B)**.  



"
"Ciao! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this puzzle!

Let's see... five houses, five people, and lots of clues!  

* The saxophonist doesn't live in the fifth house.
* Spaghetti is in the fourth house.
* The pianist is in the third house.
* Stew is right next to yellow.
* Green isn't in the fourth house.
* The pianist is to the right of the percussionist.

* Pizza is to the right of yellow.

Hmm... the pianist and fried rice are both in the third house!  

So the answer is **(D) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This sounds like a tricky puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four folks, and lots of clues.  

* We know the tea drinker is in the third house. That's a good start!

* Now, let's think about the rest. The stew eater is somewhere before the spaghetti eater, and the root beer lover is after the sandal wearer.

* Oh, and the water drinker is after the grilled cheese fan, but the grilled cheese fan isn't in the first house.

Hmmm... thinking, thinking...

*  Aha! If we put it all together, the running shoes must be in house number **(C) 1**. 


Let me know if you want to try another one!  

"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

Think of it like this: we gotta figure out where each person lives based on what they like and what they own.  We got clues about their shoes, drinks, gadgets, sports, and even their lunch!

After looking at all the clues carefully, I'm telling you, the computer is in **house number 2**. 

So the answer is **(B)**.  



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

If the fried rice eater is to the right of the science fiction fan, then the science fiction fan can't be in the house on the right.  

So the answer must be **(B) 1**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle. Let's see...

We know the pianist lives in the first house.  And the root beer lover is to the right of the horse owner. That means the horse owner can't be in the second house.  

Also, the person who likes white doesn't live in the second house.

Putting it all together, the dog owner must live in the second house!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle! Let's see...

* We know the stew eater is in house number 2, and the pizza lover is in house number 4.

* The percussionist is to the right of the science fiction fan, and the history buff is to the right of the percussionist. That means they must be in houses 3 and 4, in that order.

* The guitarist is to the left of the violinist, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

*  The fried rice eater is two houses away from the fantasy book lover.

Hmm... putting it all together, I think the percussionist lives in **house 3**. 

So the answer is (B). 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle! Let's see...

* The person who likes white lives in the first house.
* The person who likes white and the person who has daffodils live next to each other.
* The person who owns horses and the person who has daffodils live next to each other.

That means the horses must be in the first house, and the daffodils in the second!

* The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.

Okay, so we're getting somewhere!

* The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.

Hmm...

* The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has tulips.

Aha!

Putting it all together, the person who owns horses lives in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this puzzle!

Let's see... we have three houses and three people, each with their own fruit and drink.  

Hmm, the coffee drinker is right next to the milk lover, and the mango eater is right next to the apple eater.  The apple eater is in the last house, and the coffee drinker isn't in the middle house.

That means the coffee drinker must be in the first house, the milk lover in the second, and the mango eater in the second house too!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We know the science fiction fan lives in the middle house. And the carnations are in the first house.  Hmm... the person who likes white is right next to the tulips, and the red lover is next to the loafers.  

Thinking, thinking...  Aha! The boots must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the water drinker is in the first house, and the lilies are in the second.  That means the milk drinker must be in the third house, right? And since the lilies are to the right of the tulips, the tulips must be in the first house.

That leaves only one spot for the roses - the third house!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This sounds like a tricky puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four people, lots of clues...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Okay, I think I've got it!  The cricketer lives in house number **(A) 4**. 

How'd I figure it out? Well, let's just say I'm good with numbers and clues, like a detective of the mind!  



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. That's what clue number 4 tells us.  

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can solve it! Let's see...

We have three houses, three people, and lots of clues.  

* The tennis player is somewhere to the left of the TV.
* The golfer isn't in the middle house.
* The computer and tulips are right next to each other.
* The radio is to the right of the roses.
* And the radio is also to the right of the TV.

Aha! I got it! The computer must be in **house 1 (A)**. 



"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to crack this puzzle for you. Let's see... five houses, lots of clues... this is going to be fun!

*Scratches chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I'm seeing a pattern here. The swimmer is in the third house, the violinist in the second, and the daffodils are in the fifth house.  The cricketer is in the fourth house.  

Hmm, the basketball player and baseball player are neighbors, and the guitarist is somewhere near the carnations.  

And the sandals are right next to the tulips... Aha!  

I've got it! The person wearing sandals lives in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the person with the high heels is right next to the fish lover. And the grilled cheese eater is in the second house.  That means the high heels must be in the first house, and the fish lover is in the second.

Since the grilled cheese eater is in the second house, they can't be the fish lover. So, the stew must be in the first house!

The answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Okay, I think I've got it!  After looking at all the clues, the cat lover must live in **House 1**. 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

We gotta figure out where the person eating those juicy oranges is living.  

* We know the phone guy is in house number 3.
* And the flutist is also in house number 3, playing a sweet tune.
* The running shoes are in house 3 too, ready to dance!

Now, the grapes and oranges are neighbors, and the oranges are to the right of the boots. Since the flutist is in house 3, the boots must be in house 2, making the grapes in house 1 and the oranges in house 2.

So the answer is **(B) 2**.  



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa - needs a little heat to figure it out!

Let me see... houses in a row, different tastes...  I'll need to think like a detective.

*taps chin thoughtfully*

After looking at all the clues, the person eating apples lives in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This sounds like a tricky puzzle! Let's see... four houses, four folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

* Gustavo rubs his chin thoughtfully*

Okay, I'm gonna need to think this through carefully.  Give me a moment to untangle these clues...

*Gustavo mutters to himself, scribbling on a piece of paper*

Alright, I think I've got it! The person who had pizza lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"¡Hola, amigos! This puzzle is like a beautiful symphony, each clue a note leading to the final crescendo! Let's see...

The mystery book reader is in the fourth house, and the saxophonist is also in the fourth house.  That means the percussionist must be in the third house, right next to the romance book lover in the fourth.

The history book buff is one house away from the guitarist, and since the fourth house is taken, the history buff must be in the second house and the guitarist in the fifth.

The romance book lover is to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

And finally, the saxophonist and violinist are neighbors, so the violinist must be in the third house!

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We know the TV is in the last house, and the loafers are in the second.  The phone can't be in the second house, and the boots have to be somewhere before the loafers.  

Ah, and the radio and sandals have two houses between them!  

*Puts on thinking cap*

That means the Gameboy must be in house number **3 (B)**!  



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... the person with the fancy high heels lives in the second house. That's clue number one, and it's a big one!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the loafer-wearer can't be in the first house. That means they gotta be in the second house, right?  

(B) 2 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, needs a little heat to figure it out! Let's see...

We got four houses, four folks, and a whole lotta clues.  

* We know the running shoes and the Gameboy are buddies, living right next door to each other.
* Pizza is right next to the sandals, like they're sharing a plate!
* And those tulips? They're right before the pizza.

Hmm... let me think...

* The running shoes are left of the stew, and the TV is left of the radio.
* Spaghetti is left of the radio too.

Putting it all together, I'm seeing the pizza in house number 3.

So the answer is **(B)**.  



"

"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, I think I got it.  

The truck driver lives in **house 3 (C)**.

"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to crack this case!  Let's see... five houses, five folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Ah, I see the key here is to connect the dots.  We need to figure out who lives where, what they like, and what they play. It's like a musical puzzle!

*starts scribbling on a notepad*

Give me a moment to work my magic...

*intense scribbling sounds*

Aha! I've got it! The person who enjoys a nice glass of milk lives in house number **(B) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is tricky, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the basketball player lives. Hmmm... lots of clues about colors, sports, cars, and fruits. It's like a fiesta of information!

*Looks intensely at the clues, muttering to himself*

Aha! I think I got it!

The basketball player lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We know the green lover is in the third house, and the yellow lover is right next to them, so yellow must be in the second house.  The stew eater is next to the romance reader, and the fantasy reader is to the right of the stew eater.  

Hmmm... that means the stew eater must be in the first house, the romance reader in the second, and the fantasy reader in the third.  

That leaves the blue lover for the first house!

So the answer is **(C) 1**. 



"
"Ah, a puzzle! Let me see... three houses, eh?  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Okay, I've got it!  The bird keeper lives in **house 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

The fantasy book lover and the cellist both live in the first house.  And since the green lover is to the left of the red lover, the second house must have the red lover and the mystery book reader.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is tricky, but Gustavo can help you crack it!

Think of it like this: we need to figure out who lives where based on what they eat, read, wear, play, and what fruit they munch on.

It's like a big game of connect-the-dots, but with clues instead of numbers.

Let's see... those clues about the mango and orange being next to each other, and the baseball player being next to the grilled cheese... those are good starting points.

And don't forget about the loafers and running shoes! They can't be too far apart.

Keep those clues in mind and you'll be swimming in answers in no time!

Now, about that swimmer...  I'd say the swimmer lives in house number **(D) 3**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... we have three houses and three people with different hobbies and reading tastes.

The golfer is in the middle house, the history buff is in the first, and there's one house between the swimmer and the science fiction fan.  

That means the swimmer must be in the last house!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where that stew-eating friend is living.  

*Looks intensely at the clues, tapping a finger on his chin*

Hmm, it's all about connecting the dots, like a beautiful tapestry.  

After carefully considering all the clues, I'm pretty sure the stew eater is in **house number (A) 2**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

We know two people live in these houses, each with their own quirks. One likes fried rice, the other spaghetti. One loves cats, the other horses. One reads history, the other romance. And one wears sandals, the other running shoes.

The clues tell us the sandal-wearer lives to the left of the horse lover, and the history buff lives to the right of the spaghetti eater.

Hmmm... this means the history buff could be in either house, and the spaghetti eater could be in either house too!  We just don't have enough information to know for sure where the fried rice eater lives.

So the answer is, we can't tell! 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle. Let me see...

The sedan being to the left of the lilies means the lilies can't be in the first house. And since the flutist isn't in the first house either, the lilies must be in the second house. 

So the answer is (B) 2. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We have four houses, four sports, four flowers, and four types of books.  Each house has one of each.

* The mystery reader is close to the swimmer, with one house in between.
* The tennis player is to the right of the mystery reader.
* Carnations are in the last house.
* The fantasy book lover is right next to the swimmer.
* The golfer is to the right of the daffodils.
* The rose bouquet is in the third house.
* The tennis player isn't in the last house.

Hmmm... thinking, thinking...

Aha! I got it! The romance book lover is in **house 4 (B)**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle! Let me see... five houses, lots of clues... *taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I think I've got it figured out.  The person with the vase of tulips lives in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"¡Hola, amigos! Gustavo here, ready to crack this case! Let's see... three houses, three people, lots of clues.  

* We know the minivan is in the last house, and the golfer is in the first. 
* The boots are right next to the minivan, so those are in the second house.
* The cricketer is right next to the tulips, which are in the last house, so the cricketer is in the second house too.
* The rose bouquet isn't in the second house, so it must be in the first house with the golfer.

Putting it all together, the rose bouquet is in **house 1 (A)**.  

¡Easy peasy!  



"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to crack this case! Let's see... five houses, five clues... this reminds me of that time I had to figure out who stole the last cannoli from the bakery.  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I've got it! After carefully considering all the clues, the percussionist lives in house number **(C) 4**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, needs a little heat to figure it out! Let's see...

We got five houses, five people, and a whole lot of clues.  

* We know the fried rice lover is in house number three, that's a good start.

* Now, the stew eater can't be in houses two, three, or four, and the red lover is right next to them. So, the stew eater must be in house five and the red lover in house four.

*  Keep going like this, using the clues to figure out where everyone else is.

* Remember, the blue lover is somewhere before the spaghetti eater, and the grilled cheese lover is to the right of the white lover.

* And don't forget, there's one house between the white lover and the yellow lover.

Think it through carefully, and you'll find the answer!

Let me know when you've cracked the code!  



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle. Let me see...

* The red lover is in house number 3, and the drummer is in house number 2. 
* The violinist is always to the right of the basketball player, and the basketball player is always to the right of the tennis player.

Hmm... that means the basketball player must be in house number 2! 

So the answer is (C). 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is tricky, but Gustavo can help! Let's see... five houses, lots of clues...  

*taps chin thoughtfully*

After looking at all the clues carefully, I think the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house number **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this puzzle is tricky, but Gustavo can help!  

These logic problems, they are like a good tango - you gotta feel the rhythm, the connections.  

First, you gotta make a little chart, see? Five houses, one to five, and then write down all the things each house could have: flowers, music, cars, books, pets.

Then, look for the clues that tell you things are right next to each other, or that something can't be in a certain house. Those are your starting points.

Keep going, little by little, and you'll see the pattern emerge. It's like a beautiful dance, amigo!

Now, about that minivan... let me think...

The answer is **(D) 4**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this puzzle is tricky, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where those tulips are hiding.  

* The dog owner is in house number 2, that's a start.
* And the fish enthusiast is in house number 3.

Now, the clues say the tulips are next to the carnations, and those two are next to the convertible.  

Hmmm... thinking, thinking...

Aha! The tulips must be in house number **4**. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun challenge. Let's see...

* The basketball player and the saxophonist both live in the first house. That's a good start!
* The tea drinker is right next to the cricketer, and the cricketer is in the second house. So, the tea drinker must be in the first house too.
*  The pizza lover is right next to the dog owner.

Since the first house is already full, the pizza lover must be in the first house and the dog owner in the second.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

Okay, I've got it figured out. The person with the lilies lives in **house 1 (B)**. 



"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to solve this puzzle!

Let's see... five houses, lots of clues... this reminds me of that time I tried to figure out who ate the last cannoli!  

*cracks knuckles*

Alright, I'm going to need to think carefully about this.  Lots of connections between the flowers, instruments, food, and who lives where.  

Give me a few moments to put my thinking cap on... *taps temple thoughtfully*

...

Aha! I've got it! The person who had pizza lives in house number **(D) 4**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle! Let me see... four houses, lots of clues... *taps chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I think I've got it!  

The cellist lives in house **(B) 3**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

* The pianist and kiwi eater are buddies, living right next door to each other.
* The flutist is always hanging out to the right of the violinist.
* There's one house between the grape lover and the kiwi eater, and also one house between the violinist and the kiwi eater.

Hmm... thinking, thinking...

Aha! The only way this works is if the violinist is in house 1, the kiwi eater is in house 2, and the pianist is in house 3. 

So the answer is **(A) 3**.

"¡Hola! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the kiwi eater is in house number 1, and the fantasy lover isn't in house number 1.  That means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house number 2.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it!  

The person who likes red lives in house number **(D) 3**.  

It's all about connecting the clues, like pieces of a puzzle.  



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see... the root beer lover can't be in the second house, so they must be in the first house.  

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

We gotta figure out where those lilies are hiding.  

* We know the carnations are in the last house, house number five.
* And the boots are right next to them, in house number four.

Hmm... the tulips are to the left of the loafers, but not in house four.  And the daffodils are to the left of the tulips.

Let me think...

Aha! I got it! The lilies must be in house number three!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle! Let's see... four houses, lots of clues...  *Gustavo rubs his chin thoughtfully*

It's going to take some careful thinking to figure out where everyone lives and what they like. I'll need to pay close attention to those clues and see if I can find any patterns.

Give me a moment to work on this, and I'll let you know what I discover!

*Gustavo pulls out a notepad and starts scribbling furiously* 


...

Aha! I think I've got it!  The pianist lives in house number **(C) 1**. 

"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can solve it! Let's see...

We got three houses, three people, and lots of clues.  

* The white lover is in the first house, that's easy.
* The green lover is in the second house.
* And the high heels are NOT in the last house.

Hmm... the boots are right next to the high heels, and the boots are to the left of the stew eater.  

Aha! That means the boots are in the first house, the high heels in the second, and the stew eater is in the third house.

Now, we know the spaghetti eater can't be in the second house, so the fried rice must be there!

So the answer is **(A) 2**.  



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the rose bouquet is in the second house. And the science fiction fan is right next to the roses. That means the science fiction fan must be in house 3, right?

Then, the romance book lover is to the right of the carnations, and also right next to the tulips. So the tulips must be in house 4, and the romance book lover in house 3.

That leaves house 1 for the fantasy book enthusiast, and house 4 for the lilies.

So the answer is **(C) 4**.  



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

The science fiction fan is in house number 1, that much we know. And the coffee drinker is to the left of the sandal-wearer.  So, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the sandal-wearer in house 2.

That means the romance book lover must be in house number **2**. 


**Answer: (B)** 

"
"Ah, a little logic puzzle! Let me see...

The percussionist is right next to the person with the radio, so they must be in house number 1. That means the person with the phone has to be in house number 1 as well. 

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so the convertible is in the middle house, that's for sure. And the yellow lover is right next to the sedan owner.  Hmm...  

Thinking, thinking...

Aha! The yellow lover must be in the first house! 

So the answer is **(A)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's break it down.

We gotta figure out where the horse owner lives.  

* We know the runner is in house number one.
* The sedan is in house number three.

Think about the clues about the sandals, the bird, and the high heels. They give us a good idea of the order of some folks.

And don't forget about the fish enthusiast and the SUV! They're key to unlocking this mystery.

After you consider all the clues carefully, you'll find the horse owner is in **(C) 4**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this puzzle is like a spicy salsa - lots of ingredients to juggle! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where that truck driver is hiding.  

*First, we know the convertible is in house number one, and the bird keeper is there too.

*The loafers are in house number two, and next door is the kiwi eater.

*The rose bouquet is in house one, and the lilies are to the right of that.

*The tulips are left of the boots, and the daffodils are left of the horses.

*The sedan is left of the SUV, and the sandals are left of the truck.

*The grapes and fish enthusiast are neighbors, and the apples are to the left of the fish enthusiast.

*The loafers guy is next to the kiwi eater, and there are two houses between the lilies and the high heels.

*Two houses separate the dog owner and the orange eater.

*The running shoes aren't in the first house.

*The grapes aren't in the fourth house.

Whew! That's a lot to keep track of!

After carefully considering all these clues, I'm pretty sure the truck driver is in **house number (C) 5**. 


Let me know if you want to try another puzzle, amigo!
"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can solve it! Let's see...

We know the fried rice eater is in the middle house, right? And that same person loves fantasy books.  The spaghetti lover is to their left, which means they're in the first house. The science fiction fan is to the left of the fried rice eater, so they must also be in the first house.

That leaves the last house for the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese lover. 

So the answer is **(C) 3**.  



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see... the carnations are to the left of the dog owner, and the houses are right next to each other.  That means the carnations must be in house number 1. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

The kiwi eater is in house number 2, right? And the water drinker is right next to the high heel wearer.  

Hmmm... that means the high heels must be in house number 2!

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we have two houses, and each person inside is different. One has a TV, one has a phone, one wears sandals, one wears high heels, one drinks tea, one drinks water, one eats kiwis, and one eats grapes.  

Hmm... the clues are important here. Let's see... high heels are to the left of sandals, and grapes and sandals are right next to each other.  That means it has to be high heels, then grapes, then sandals.

And the tea drinker is to the left of the person with the TV.

Thinking, thinking...

Aha!  The person with the TV must be eating the kiwis!  

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle. Let's see...

* The tea drinker is in the first house, that's a good start.
* The violinist can't be in the last house, and they have to be one house away from the guitarist.  
* That means the violinist must be in the first house and the guitarist in the last!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this puzzle!

Let's see... sandals in the third house, milk in the third house too... ah, and the water drinker is right next to the sandals! That means the water drinker must be in house number 4. 

So the answer is **(B) 4**.  



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, needs a little figuring out! Let's see...

We got five houses, five folks, and they all got different gadgets and ate different lunches.  

* House 1: Gameboy, Fried Rice
* House 2: Computer, Radio
* House 3: Grilled Cheese
* House 4: Pizza, Spaghetti
* House 5: Television, Phone

Looks like the spaghetti lover is in **house 4**.

So the answer is **(A)**.  



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa - needs a little time to simmer and the flavors will come out!

Let me see... five houses, five folks, and a whole lot of clues.  We gotta be methodical, like a good tango.

*First, we gotta lay out our dance floor - a grid with each house and all the clues.*

Then, we start connecting the dots. Some clues are like a strong beat, telling us exactly where someone is. Others are more like a subtle rhythm, needing us to feel the pattern.

*We gotta keep going, clue by clue, until the whole picture comes together.*

And then, bam! We'll know exactly who's eating that banana and where they're living.

Give me a little time to work my magic, and I'll tell you which house it is.

**(C) 3** 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

Okay, so we have two houses, two musicians, two lunches, and two pets.  

The grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, and the percussionist isn't in the second house. That means the percussionist must be in the first house!  

If the percussionist is in the first house, the guitarist must be in the second. And since the grilled cheese eater is to the right of the bird keeper, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the grilled cheese eater in the second.

That means the pizza eater must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(B) 1**. 



"
"Ciao! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

The bird keeper lives in house number **3**.  Clue number 2 tells us that straight up! 🐦🏠 



"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to crack this case! Let's see... three houses, lots of clues... this is going to be fun!

*Scratches chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I'm seeing a pattern here.  The cat lover is in the first house, that's a good start. And we know a few things can't be in the second house. Hmm...

*Taps pencil on the table*

After carefully considering all the clues, I've figured it out! The science fiction book fanatic lives in house number **(C) 3**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this puzzle!

Let's see... four houses, four people, lots of clues.  

* We know the grape lover is in house number two. That's a good start!

*  Red and green are best buddies, living right next door to each other. And red is always to the right of the kiwi eater.

* White and red have a house between them.

* Green is a lefty, living to the left of yellow.

* And finally, white and banana have a house between them too.

Hmmm... putting it all together, the kiwi eater must be in house number one!

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the person with the running shoes is to the right of the orange eater. And the mystery book reader is right next to the cat lover.  But the mystery book reader also lives next to the stew eater.  

Hmmm... that means the stew eater can't be in the second house, right? There wouldn't be room for the running shoes person!

So, the stew eater must be in **house #1**. 


**(B)** 

"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We know the water drinker is in the middle house, and the root beer lover is in the first.  The daffodils are right next to the phone, so those must be in the second and third houses.  The TV can't be in the middle house, and it's gotta be to the right of the tulips, so that means the tulips are in the first house and the TV is in the last.

That leaves the milk for the first house!

So the answer is **(A) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This sounds like a tricky puzzle! Let's see... three houses, three people, lots of clues...

*taps chin thoughtfully*

Okay, I think I got it!  

The person with the computer lives in house number **(C) 2**. 



"
"¡Hola, amigos! Gustavo here, ready to crack this case! Let's see... three houses, three sports, three flower arrangements, and three pets.  

* We know the golfer isn't in the last house, and neither is the cricketer. 
* The golfer and baseball player are neighbors, and the carnations and horse owner are neighbors too.
* The carnations are to the left of the baseball player, and the rose bouquet is to the left of the daffodils.
* Oh, and the fish enthusiast is somewhere to the left of the horse owner!

Hmmm... after carefully considering all the clues, I've figured it out! The horse owner lives in **house 3 (A)**.  

¡Ay, caramba! This was a fun one!  



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can solve it!

Let's see... oranges are in the first house, and the horses are in the third.  The truck has to be next to the convertible, and the mangos and convertible are buddies too.  

Hmmm... that means the truck must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This sounds like a fun puzzle! Let's see... five houses, five people, and lots of clues.

"
"Ah, a puzzle! I love a good challenge. Let me see... five houses, different people, colors, instruments, devices... *Gustavo strokes his chin thoughtfully*

Hmm, this takes some thinking.  

*taps fingers on the table rhythmically*

Aha! I think I've got it! The saxophonist must live in house number **1**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

We know a few things: the cellist lives to the left of the mystery reader, and the history buff lives to the left of the cat lover.  Also, the root beer lover and the guitarist are neighbors.

Hmm... this means we have a few possibilities.  But, no matter how we arrange these clues, we can't be sure if the horse owner is in house 1 or house 2.  

It's a tie! 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a fun little puzzle! Let me see...

We have three houses, three people, and three clues.  

* The carnations are to the right of the bird, so the bird can't be in the last house.
* The dog owner isn't in the middle house.
* And the tulips are to the right of the dog.

Hmmm... thinking, thinking...

Aha! If the dog isn't in the middle, and the tulips are to the right of the dog, the dog must be in the first house! That means the tulips are either in the second or third house. But remember, the carnations are to the right of the bird, so the bird can't be in the last house.  

Therefore, the tulips must be in the second house!

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This sounds like a tricky puzzle! Let's see... four houses, lots of clues...  

*Gustavo rubs his chin thoughtfully, muttering to himself in Spanish*

The person wearing loafers lives in house **(C) 1**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the mango lover is in the first house.  And the horses aren't in the first or second house.  Hmm... the banana person is right next to the dog owner, and they can't be in the third house.  

That means the banana must be in the second house, and the dog owner in the third!  The bird keeper and kiwi eater are buddies, living next door to each other.  And since the horses are in the last house, the bird keeper must be in the third house.

So the answer is **(D) 3**.  



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a fun little puzzle! Let's see...

We know the mystery reader is in the first house.  And the romance lover can't be in the last house.  

Hmm... the bird lover is right next to the history buff. That means they must be in houses 1 and 2!

Aha! That leaves the romance lover in the second house. 

So the answer is **(B)**. 



"

"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the lilies are in the middle house, right?  And the coffee drinker can't be next to the roses or the SUV.  That means the coffee drinker must be in the last house!

So the answer is **(C) 3**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can solve it! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the truck is parked.  

* We know the blue lover is right next to the spaghetti eater.
* And the stew-lover is somewhere to the left of the lilies.
* The rose bouquet is right next to the truck.
* The minivan is right next to the stew, and the minivan is also right next to the daffodils.

The sedan is parked in house number **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We know the gameboy is in the third house, and the red lover is in the second.  The grapes gotta be to the right of the red, so that puts them in the third house too.  White has to be left of the grapes, so that's house one.

Now, the phone is right next to the running shoes, and the third house is full, so the phone must be in the first house!

So the answer is **(C) 1**.  



"
"Ciao! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

The bird keeper lives in the second house.  That's a pretty straightforward clue, eh? 

So the answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo, this is a tricky one! Let's see...

We know the saxophonist is in the first house, and they're next to the tea drinker and the grape eater.  The baseball player is also next to the grape eater.  That means the first house must have the saxophonist, the tea drinker, and the grape eater, and the second house has the baseball player.

The golfer is next to the saxophonist, so they're also in the first house. And the romance book lover is next to the golfer, so they're in the first house too!

That leaves the mango eater and the science fiction fan for the second house.

So the answer is **(A) 2**. 



"

"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

We know some things for sure: the grape eater is next to the truck driver, and the yellow lover is also next to the truck driver.  Plus, the boots wearer is next to the mystery reader.

Hmm...  I can't quite figure out where the fantasy book lover lives just yet.  We need more clues, amigo! 



"

So the answer is **(C) 2**. 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle. Let me see...

Okay, so we know the violinist and the basketball player are the same person, and they live in the middle house.  That means the cellist must be in the last house, and the cricketer must be in the first.  

That leaves the soccer player for the first house!

So the answer is **(A) 1**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

"
"Ciao! Gustavo here, ready to crack this case! Let's see... four houses, four folks, and a whole lot of clues.  

*Scratches chin thoughtfully*

Alright, I'm seeing a pattern here. The coffee drinker is in house number four, and so is the flutist and the horse lover.  That means the tennis player can't be in house four.

Hmm, the guitarist is somewhere to the right of the cricketer... and the dog owner and root beer lover are neighbors.  

*Taps pencil on table*

The fish enthusiast is to the right of the basketball player, and the water drinker and tennis player are side-by-side.

Ah! I've got it!  

The sedan is in house number **(A) 3**. 



"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... we have two houses, two people, and lots of clues.  

The soccer player is in the second house, that's a good start. And the blue lover is right next to the root beer lover.  Since the soccer player is in house number two, the blue lover must be in house one, and the root beer lover in house two.

So the answer is **(B) 2**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This puzzle is like a spicy salsa, full of flavor and a little bit tricky! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the swimmer lives.

That's my guess!  Let me know if I'm right! 



"
"Ciao! This is a fun little puzzle! Let me see... the violinist is in the first house, and the computer person is to the left of the bird keeper.  That means the bird keeper must be in the second house!

* We know the rose bouquet is in the first house and the gameboy is there too.

* The television is in the third house.

Now, we gotta use those clues like breadcrumbs to find the computer. It's a bit of a dance, but we can do it!

After carefully considering all the clues, I'm pretty sure the computer is in **house 5**. 

So the answer is **(E)**. 



"
"Ay, this is a tricky one! Let me see...

Okay, so we know the boots are in the middle house, and the sedan is in the last house.  The cat lover is in the first house.  Hmm... the high heels are next to the dog owner, and the SUV is next to the boots.

That means the running shoes must be in the last house!

So the answer is **(C)**. 



"
"Ay, amigo! This is a tricky one, but Gustavo can crack it! Let's see...

We gotta figure out where the apple eater lives. Hmmm...

* The tea drinker is in the third house, that's a good start.

"
"¡Hola! This is Gustavo, ready to solve this mystery!

Let's see... three houses, three book lovers, and three gadgets.  

* We know the mystery reader is in the first house. 
* That means the history buff must be in the second house, since they live right next door.
* And since the mystery reader is right next to the TV watcher, the TV must be in the second house too.

That leaves the third house for the science fiction fan.

So the answer is **(B) 3**. 



"
"Ay, mi amigo, that's a tough one. St. Vitus's Dance, it makes the body move in ways you can't control.  Ballet, it needs grace and precision.
