"Okay, so Janet starts with 16 eggs. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins, which is a total of 7 eggs. That leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell.  Since she sells each egg for $2, she makes 9 * $2 = $18 at the market. 


$18 

"
"Okay, so the robe needs twice as much blue fiber as white fiber.  That means it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.  

In total, that's 3 bolts.

"
"Okay, so Josh spent $80,000 on the house and then another $50,000 fixing it up. That's a total of $130,000.

The repairs made the house worth 150% more, which means it's now worth 2.5 times what it was originally. So, it's worth $80,000 * 2.5 = $200,000.

If he sells it for $200,000 and it cost him $130,000 to buy and fix up, he made a profit of $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.


$70,000
"
"Okay, so James runs 3 sprints three times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters.  To find the total distance, we need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint.

That's 3 sprints/day * 3 days/week = 9 sprints a week.

Then, 9 sprints/week * 60 meters/sprint = 540 meters a week.


540 

"
"Okay, so Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of food a day, and she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups.  Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs to give them a total of 60 cups.

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the last meal. 


20 

"
"Okay, so Kylar's buying 16 glasses, right?  Every other one is cheaper.  

Let's see... he's basically buying 8 pairs. Each pair has one glass for $5 and one for $3 (60% of $5). So each pair costs $8.

8 pairs times $8 per pair is $64. 


$64
"
"Okay, so Seattle has 20 sheep. Charleston has four times that amount, which is 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so they have 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

To find the total, we add up the sheep from all three places: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep. 



"
"Okay, so Carla's downloading a huge file, 200 GB! She usually gets 2 GB every minute, which is pretty fast. But then, ugh, Windows decides to update right in the middle, at 40% of the download. That's a bummer because it takes 20 minutes to update, and she has to start all over!

Let's see... 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB, so she downloaded that much before the update.  That took her 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

She's got 120 GB left to download, and that'll take another 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

So, in total, it took her 40 minutes + 20 minutes (for the update) + 60 minutes = 120 minutes to download the whole thing.



"
"Okay, so John drives 3 hours at 60 mph, which is 3 * 60 = 180 miles. Then he has to turn around and go back.

He's stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he doesn't go anywhere during that time.  After that, he drives slowly for half an hour at 30 mph, which is 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.

That leaves him with 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours to drive fast.  At 80 mph, he covers 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.

So in total, he drives 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles on the way back.

Since he drove 180 miles out and 135 miles back, he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home. 


45
"
"Okay, so Eliza makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours. That's $400 right there (40 * 10 = 400).  Then she gets paid extra for the extra 5 hours.  That extra pay is $12 an hour (10 * 1.2 = 12). So for those 5 hours, she makes $60 (5 * 12 = 60).

Adding it all up, she made $460 this week ($400 + $60 = $460).


$460 

"
"Okay, so the program got 60 downloads the first month.  The second month it got three times that, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads. But then the third month it went down by 30% of the second month's downloads.  That's 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads less. So the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

To find the total, we add up all three months: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.



"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

* Donuts: 3 dozen * $68 per dozen = $204
* Mini Cupcakes: 2 dozen * $80 per dozen = $160
* Mini Cheesecakes: 6 dozen * $55 per dozen = $330

Add those all up: $204 + $160 + $330 = $694



"
"Okay, so Carlos spends $90 to plant the tree.  Every year he makes $10.50 selling lemons (7 lemons x $1.50 each) but it costs him $3 to take care of it. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 each year ($10.50 - $3.00).  

To figure out when he starts making money, we divide the cost of the tree by his yearly profit: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.


12 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  

Before selling to the orange house, she must have had double that plus 2, because she sold half to the orange house. So that's 5 * 2 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.

Before selling to the red house, she had 12 + 2 = 14 vacuum cleaners.

And before selling to the green house, she had 14 * 3 = 42 vacuum cleaners.


So Melanie started with 42 vacuum cleaners. 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the class likes contemporary, which is 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students.  That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students. Then 25% of those like jazz, so that's 16 * 0.25 = 4 students.  That means 16 - 4 = 12 students like hip-hop.

So, 12 out of 20 students like hip-hop, which is (12/20) * 100% = 60%.


60 

"
"Okay, so the merchant wants to make more money, right?  Let's see...

The jewelry will be worth $5000 + (2.5% of $5000) = $5000 + $125 = $5125

The gadgets will be worth $8000 + (1.2% of $8000) = $8000 + $96 = $8096

So, the jewelry will make him a profit of $125 and the gadgets will make him a profit of $96.  

The jewelry will make him more money!

**Answer:** $125 



"
"Okay, so both trains travel 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. To find the total distance, we just add those together: 80 + 150 = 230 miles. 

230 

"
"Okay, so Jill makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that.  That's $20 * 35 = $700 a week just from teaching.

Then she makes $30 an hour coaching and does that for 15 hours a week, so that's $30 * 15 = $450 a week.

Altogether she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 every week.

If she works 50 weeks a year, her total salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.


57500 

"
"Okay, so she eats 3 eggs a day, and there are 7 days in a week, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 eggs a week.  Over four weeks, that's 21 * 4 = 84 eggs.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she eats 84 / 12 = 7 dozen eggs. 

7 

"
"Okay, so Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile hike.  She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left to go and only 1 hour to do it in.  To figure out her speed, we just divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

She needs to walk at 6 miles per hour for the rest of the hike. 



"
"Okay, so we've got 10 liters of orange drink, and two-thirds of that is water, which is 6.67 liters. Then we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of that is water, which is 9 liters.  

But wait, I spilled a liter of the orange drink! So now we only have 9 liters of it left.

Adding up all the water, we have 6.67 liters (from the orange) + 9 liters (from the pineapple) = 15.67 liters of water in total.



"
"Okay, so Samantha is 31 and her cousin Raymond is 6 years older, making him 37.  Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is 37 - 23 = 14 years old. That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago. 

14 

"
"Okay, so Billy sold DVDs to some of his customers. Let's see... the first three bought one each, so that's 3 DVDs. Then two more customers bought two each, so that's another 4 DVDs.  

He didn't sell any to the last three, so in total, he sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs. 


7 

"
"Okay, so the candle burns for four hours.  If it melts 2 centimeters every hour, you just multiply those together. 

4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters 



"
"Okay, so the book is 25% off, which means Kyle paid 75% of the original price.  If $19.50 is 75% of the original price, we can figure out what 1% is by dividing: $19.50 / 75 = $0.26.  Then, to find the original price (which is 100%), we multiply that by 100: $0.26 x 100 = $26.00.


$26.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how much Marie spent on everything except the pizza:

* The chicken meal was $12.
* The milk cost 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.
* The apples cost 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.

So, the chicken, milk, and apples cost a total of $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

That means the pizza cost $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each pizza box costs $8.50, Marie bought $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes of pizza. 


2 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Mishka bought 3 of each item, so we need to multiply the price of each item by 3.

* Shorts: 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50
* Pants: 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50
* Shoes: 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00

Now, let's add up the cost of everything: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00

Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothes. 



"
"Okay, so Cynthia eats ice cream every day, and each carton has enough for 15 days.  That means she'll go through 4 cartons in 60 days (60 / 15 = 4). Since each carton costs $4, she'll spend $16 in total (4 * $4 = $16).


16.00 

"
"Okay, so Henry biked 60 miles total. He stopped at 20 miles, and then again 15 miles before the finish line.  That means his second stop was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.  

He biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between his stops.


25 

"
"Okay, so the expensive heels cost twice as much as the cheaper ones, which are $33.  That means the expensive ones are $33 * 2 = $66.

Together, both pairs of heels cost $33 + $66 = $99.

Since the boots cost $5 more than the heels, they must be $99 + $5 = $104.


$104 

"
"Okay, so Darrell and Allen's ages are like a fraction, 7:11. That means if we add those together, we get 18 parts.  Their total age is 162, so each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.


109 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* Friend 1 guesses 80 jelly beans.
* Friend 2 says 20 more than half of Friend 1's guess, so that's (80 / 2) + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
* Friend 3 guesses 25% more than Friend 1, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses (3): 240 / 3 = 80.

So the average guess is 80 jelly beans. 



"
"Okay, so John has 10 dogs and each one takes half an hour to walk and do their business. That's 5 hours a day just for walking all of them!  Since there are 7 days in a week, he spends 5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. 


35 

"
"Let's break this problem down.  

We know Gretchen has 110 coins total, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

Think of it like this: if we take away those extra 30 gold coins, we'd have the same number of gold and silver coins. That means we'd have 110 coins / 2 = 55 of each type.

Since there are 30 more gold coins, Gretchen has 55 + 30 = 85 gold coins. 


Answer: 70
"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

Raymond has 40 jewels. Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels, so Aaron has 20 (half of 40) + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, meaning she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.


23 

"
"Okay, so Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.  Then he scores 25% more in the next 20 minutes. That means he scores an extra point (4 x 0.25 = 1). So in the second half, he gets 5 points (4 + 1 = 5).  In total, he scores 9 points (4 + 5 = 9).


9 

"
"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, and that's 60 yogurts in a month.  Since the yogurts come in packs of 4 for $5, he'll need 15 packs (60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per pack = 15 packs). That means he'll spend $75 on yogurt for the month (15 packs * $5 per pack = $75).


$75.00 

"
"Okay, so John makes $15 for each Lego set he sells, and he has 13 sets. That means he made 13 * $15 = $195 from selling them.

He spent $20 on each video game, and he bought 8, so that's 8 * $20 = $160 spent on games.

He had $5 left over, so before buying games he had $160 + $5 = $165.

That means he sold enough Lego sets to make $165, so he sold $165 / $15 per set = 11 Lego sets.

Since he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left. 


2 

"
"Okay, so John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days.  He runs for 3 hours the first day, and then half that time, which is 1.5 hours, on the other two days. That means he runs a total of 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours a week.

To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. 


10
"
"Okay, so Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed. That means she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, she walks at 1.5 miles per hour (6 miles per hour / 4).

She spends one-third of her time running, which is 2 hours out of the 6 hours total. That means she spends 4 hours walking.

So, while running she covers 12 miles (6 miles per hour * 2 hours). While walking, she covers 6 miles (1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours).

In total, she travels 18 miles. 


18
"
"Okay, so Suzy's phone is 1 year old. Ben's phone is twice as old as Suzy's, making it 2 years old.  Brandon's phone is four times as old as Ben's, so it's 2 years * 4 = 8 years old. 

8 

"
"Okay, so Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally. But with the gemstone, she can throw it three times that distance, which is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.  The dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet, so she can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and still hit it.


200 

"
"Okay, so Grandma made 5 pies and each pie had 8 slices, meaning there were 5 * 8 = 40 slices total. If there were 14 slices left over, then the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 slices. 


26
"
"Okay, so the bag has 5 servings and each serving is 250 calories. That means the whole bag is 5 * 250 = 1250 calories.  You can only have 200 more calories today, so that's less than one whole serving.  

Each serving is 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams. Since you can only have 0.8 servings, you can eat 0.8 * 60 grams = 48 grams of chips.


48 

"
"Okay, so Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles because he can make 10 candles per pound. That means his supplies will cost him $20.00.  He'll make $40.00 selling all the candles. If he takes the money he made and subtracts the cost of the supplies, his profit is $20.00.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so Meredith writes 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she writes 2/5 more than that, which is like 2 extra articles, so she writes 5 + 2 = 7 articles. Then on Wednesday, she doubles Tuesday's amount, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 articles.

In total, she writes 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours, she spends 26 * 4 = 104 hours writing.


104 

"
"Okay, so Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 at work, and had 23 left over.  To figure out how many were in the package, we gotta add the ones she started with and the ones she had left, then subtract the ones she used.

That's 80 + 23 = 103. Then 103 + 220 = 323.

So she must have bought a package with 323 - 80 = 243 Post-it notes. 


243 

"
"Okay, so John bought 5 blue ties because he spent $200 and each blue tie costs $40.  Since he buys twice as many red ties, he got 10 red ties. Red ties are 50% more than blue ties, so they cost $60 each. That means he spent $600 on red ties (10 ties * $60/tie).  In total, he spent $800 on ties ($200 + $600).


$800 

"
"Okay, so Tracy has 4 feet of wire, which is 48 inches.  If each piece is 6 inches long, she can make 48 / 6 = 8 pieces. 


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 15 floors with 8 apartments on each floor, meaning there are 15 * 8 = 120 apartments total. If 3/4 of the building is full, that means 120 * (3/4) = 90 apartments are taken.  That leaves 120 - 90 = 30 apartments empty.


30 

"
"Okay, so Lloyd gets 252 eggs every day. That's like, a lot of eggs!  If he sells them for $2 a dozen, let's see... there are 12 eggs in a dozen, so he makes 252 / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs each day.

That means he makes 21 * $2 = $42 each day.

Over a whole week, that's $42/day * 7 days/week = $294.

So Lloyd makes $294 a week from his eggs. 



"
"Okay, so Tom travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, which means he goes 30 miles (10 x 3 = 30).  

On the way back, he's going slower, only 6 miles per hour. To figure out how long that takes, we divide the distance by his speed: 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them, so that's 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.  That means he still needs to take out 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 more pounds. Since each toy weighs half a pound, he needs to remove 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 toys.


15 

"
"Okay, so the mechanic makes $60 per truck tire and $40 per car tire.

On Thursday, he fixed 6 truck tires, so that's 6 * $60 = $360. He also fixed 4 car tires, which is 4 * $40 = $160.  His total for Thursday is $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, he only fixed car tires, 12 of them. That's 12 * $40 = $480.

To find the difference, we do $520 - $480 = $40.


The mechanic made $40 more on Thursday. 

"
"Okay, so the Doubtfire sisters brought home 7 kittens. Then their mom tells them their cats had kittens too! Patchy had three times the number of adopted kittens, which is 7 * 3 = 21 kittens.  The other cat, Trixie, had 12 kittens.  

So in total, they have 21 + 12 = 33 kittens from their cats, plus the 7 they adopted, for a grand total of 33 + 7 = 40 kittens! 

40 

"
"Okay, so Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, leaving her with 28.  Since she puts 2 lollipops in each bag, she can make 14 bags. 


14 

"
"Okay, so Peter spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn each time, meaning each movie trip costs him $14.  If he has $42, he can go to the movies 3 times. 


3
"
"Okay, so the truck and driver weigh 3755 pounds, and the bridge can only hold 5000 pounds. That means there are 1245 pounds left for the boxes (5000 - 3755 = 1245).  Each box weighs 15 pounds, so you can fit 83 boxes on the truck (1245 / 15 = 83).


83 

"
"Okay, so Stephen's groceries were $40.00. Then they added a 25% fee, which is $10.00.  Then there's a $3.00 delivery fee, so that's $43.00 total.  He also tipped $4.00, so the final price is $47.00. 


$47.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 groups of raspberries with 20 in each group, that's 6 * 20 = 120 raspberries. Then there are 67 more raspberries just hanging out on the bush.  So in total, there are 120 + 67 = 187 raspberries. 

187 

"
"Okay, so there are 25 oranges total. One is bad, 20% are unripe (which is 5 oranges), and 2 are sour.  That means there are 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges that aren't good.  

So, 25 - 8 = 17 oranges must be good. 


17 

"
"Okay, so Janet spent $500 on stuff to make the brooch and then another $800 to have someone make it. That's $500 + $800 = $1300.

Then she had to pay 10% for insurance, which is $1300 * 0.10 = $130.

Adding it all up, she spent $1300 + $130 = $1430 on the brooch.


$1430 

"
"Okay, so Marcy gets $50,000 a year after working for 40 years. But she gets an extra 5% every year after 20 years.  Since she quits after 30 years, she gets the bonus for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10).

That bonus is 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500 each year.

So, her total pension is $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 a year.


$52,500 

"
"Okay, so Aleena pays $140 each month for the first six months, which is $140 * 6 = $840.

Then her price goes down by 10%, so she saves $140 * 0.10 = $14 each month.

That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the last six months, which is $126 * 6 = $756.

In total, she pays $840 + $756 = $1596 for the whole year.


1596 

"
"Okay, so Sophia drove 100 miles and needed 4 gallons to fill her tank back up. That means her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG).  Since her tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles).


300 

"
"Okay, so Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. That means he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading each day.

He does this 3 times a week, so that's 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours per week.

Over 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.


36 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  Each school has 2 teams with 5 players each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 players per school.  They also have 2 coaches, so each school has 10 + 2 = 12 people there. Since there are 4 schools, that means a total of 12 * 4 = 48 people went to the tournament. 


48 

"
"Okay, so there are 175 diamonds. There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.  There are twice as many emeralds as rubies, meaning there are 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

To find the total, we add up all the gems: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems. 


595 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, meaning there are 60 girls * 2 = 120 boys.  That's a total of 120 + 60 = 180 students.  If there are 5 students for every teacher, then there are 180 students / 5 students per teacher = 36 teachers.

"
"Okay, so Bailey got $5 every week for 8 weeks, which is a total of $5 * 8 = $40.  If she has $100 now, that means she started with $100 - $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Judy teaches a lot of dance classes! 

She teaches 5 classes each weekday, so that's 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes.

Then she teaches 8 more on Saturday, for a total of 25 + 8 = 33 classes in a week.

If each class has 15 students, she has 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students in total.

Finally, at $15 per student, she makes 495 students * $15.00/student = $7425.00 in a week. 


$7425.00
"
"Okay, so the first recipe has 20 instructions. The second one has twice that, so it has 20 * 2 = 40 instructions.  To find the total, we add them up: 20 + 40 = 60 instructions.


60 

"
"Okay, so Tommy sells brownies for $3 each and he sold 43 of them. That's 43 * $3 = $129.  He also sold cheesecake for $4 a slice and sold 23 slices, so that's 23 * $4 = $92.  To find out how much he raised total, we add those together: $129 + $92 = $221.


$221
"
"Okay, so Shiela bought 5 phones at $150 each, so that's 5 * $150 = $750.  

But there's also a 2% interest on each phone, so that's $150 * 0.02 = $3 interest per phone.

Since she bought 5 phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

That means she has to pay $750 + $15 = $765 in total.

She's paying over 3 months, so each month she'll pay $765 / 3 = $255.



"
"Okay, so Artie's rounding his prices to the nearest dollar.  That means marigolds are $3, petunias are $2, and begonias are $2.

* He sells 12 marigolds at $3 each, so that's 12 * $3 = $36.
* He sells 9 petunias at $2 each, so that's 9 * $2 = $18.
* He sells 17 begonias at $2 each, so that's 17 * $2 = $34.

If you add all that up, he makes $36 + $18 + $34 = $88.


88
"
"Okay, so the top level is 16 square feet, and each level below is double the size.  That means the level below the top is 16 * 2 = 32 square feet. The level below that is 32 * 2 = 64 square feet, and the bottom level is 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

To find the average, we add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet. Then we divide by the number of levels (4) to get 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.


60 

"
"Okay, so Cecilia needs to figure out how much dog food she'll need for her puppy's first year.  

First, she feeds the puppy 1 cup a day for 180 days, so that's 180 cups right there. Then, for the rest of the year (which is 185 days), she feeds it 2 cups a day, meaning she needs 370 cups (2 x 185 = 370).

In total, she needs 550 cups of food (180 + 370 = 550).  Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need to buy 5 bags (550 / 110 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Raymond does half of what Sarah does, which is 400 / 2 = 200 pounds. David does a quarter of what Sarah does, so he does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  That means Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 pounds more laundry than David.


100 

"
"Okay, so Vincent wants to get the best deal on flowers.  

If he buys the packs of 3, that's $2.50 per pack, and he needs 6 packs for 18 flowers, so that's 6 times $2.50 which is $15.

If he buys the packs of 2, that's $1 per pack, and he needs 9 packs for 18 flowers. So that's 9 times $1 which is $9.

He definitely saves money buying the packs of 2! He saves $15 - $9 = $6. 


$6.00
"
"Okay, so the groomer costs $100, but John gets 30% off because he's a new customer.  To find the discount, you multiply the original price by the discount percentage: $100 * 0.30 = $30.  Then you subtract the discount from the original price: $100 - $30 = $70.

So the grooming costs $70. 



"
"Okay, so they started with 24 liters.  Each girl got 1/6 of that, which is 4 liters (24 / 6 = 4).  Since there are two girls, they took a total of 8 liters (4 x 2 = 8).

That leaves 16 liters (24 - 8 = 16). Then the boy takes 6 liters, leaving 10 liters (16 - 6 = 10).


10 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Charlie starts with 10 stickers, then gets 21 more, so that's 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.  Then he gets 23 for his birthday, bringing his total to 31 + 23 = 54 stickers. He gives 9 to his sister, leaving him with 54 - 9 = 45 stickers. Finally, he uses 28 stickers, so he has 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left.


17 

"
"Okay, so Alex weighs 4 times Grace's weight minus 2 pounds. That means Alex weighs (4 * 125) - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.


623 

"
"Okay, so Dan has 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses. That means he has a total of 3 * 25 = 75 roses.  Since each rose has 8 thorns, there are 75 * 8 = 600 thorns in total. 


600 

"
"Okay, so they played 22 games total.  Let's see... they won 8 more games than they lost.  Hmm, to figure this out, I'd think about it like this:

If they won the same number of games as they lost, they'd have won 22 / 2 = 11 games.

Since they won 8 *more* than they lost, they must have won 11 + 8 = 15 games.


**Answer:** 15 

"
"Okay, so Gene's been on vacation four times each year since he was 23.  He's 34 now, so that's 34 - 23 = 11 years of vacations.

That means he's been on 11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations.

Since each vacation shirt is a quilt block, he has 44 quilt blocks. 


44
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

The alarm rings 4 times the first time. The second time it rings three times longer, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 times. The third time it rings half as long as the second time, which is 12 / 2 = 6 times.

In total, the alarm rings 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times. 


22
"
"Okay, so Sylvie gets a raise of 10% of her salary every year after five years.  That means her salary goes up by $60 each year ($600 x 0.10 = $60).

After one year, she'll make $660.

After two years, she'll make $726 ($660 + $66).

And after three years, she'll make $798.60 ($726 + $72.60).



"
"Okay, so Marilyn sold 10 times more records than Harald.  If they sold a total of 88,000, we need to figure out what Harald sold.  

Think of it like this: if we split the total sales into 11 parts (1 for Harald and 10 for Marilyn), each part would be 88,000 / 11 = 8,000 copies.

So Harald sold 8,000 copies. 


8000
"
"Okay, so Christina invited 16 friends, but only 3/4 of them will actually come. That's 16 * (3/4) = 12 friends.

She needs 0.75 gift bags for each friend who shows up, so that's 12 * 0.75 = 9 gift bags.

Each gift bag costs $2, so she'll spend 9 * $2 = $18 on gift bags.


$18 

"
"Okay, so adults eat 10 pounds of potato salad each, and kids eat half that, which is 5 pounds.  There are 20 adults, so they'll eat 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad. The 5 kids will eat 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.  

To feed everyone, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad. 


225 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, who has four. So Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, meaning Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.  

To find the total, we add up the number of pets each person has: 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.


28 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

We know James is 10 and Corey is one year older than him, so Corey is 11. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, making her 9.  Finally, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson must be 4. 


4
"
"Okay, so Lee is faster than Gerald by 2 seconds, meaning Gerald originally took 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds.

If Gerald got 10% faster, that's like taking 10% of 40 seconds, which is 4 seconds off his time.

So, Gerald's new time is 40 seconds - 4 seconds = 36 seconds.


36 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 dogs.  Since there are twice as many cats as dogs, there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That means there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

To find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.


348 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 fifth graders, and 2/5 of them are boys. That means there are 200 * (3/5) = 120 girls.  

Then, 2/3 of the girls are in Girl Scouts, so that's 120 * (2/3) = 80 girls.

That leaves 120 - 80 = 40 girls who aren't in Girl Scouts.


40 

"
"Okay, so James slept for two-thirds of the time Harry did. That means James slept for (2/3) * 9 hours = 6 hours.  Harry slept 3 more hours than James.


3 

"
"Okay, so Freda's tomato sauce shrinks to half the size when she cooks it.  That means each can of tomatoes, which starts with 16 ounces, makes 16 / 2 = 8 ounces of sauce.

She ended up with 32 ounces of sauce, and each can makes 8 ounces, so she used 32 / 8 = 4 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, she used a total of 4 cans * 3 tomatoes/can = 12 tomatoes.


12 

"
"Okay, so there were 30 cars at first, and 5 took an exit. That leaves 25 cars.  We know 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes, so the rest must have gone through in the first 15 minutes.

25 - 20 = 5 cars 

5 

"
"Okay, so Mary starts with 2 plants on each of her 40 window ledges, which is 2 * 40 = 80 plants. Then she gets 18 more, so she has 80 + 18 = 98 plants. But she gives one plant from each ledge away, which is 40 plants. That leaves her with 98 - 40 = 58 plants. 


58
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 more times than the first friend, who rang it 20 times. That means the second friend rang it 20 * (1/4) = 5 more times, for a total of 25 rings.

The third friend rang it 10 more times than the fourth friend, who rang it 60 times. So the third friend rang it 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Adding up all the rings: 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings. 


175 

"
"Okay, so Solo has to read a bunch of pages from different textbooks. Let's see... he needs to read 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages total.

He already read 15 pages, so he has 39 - 15 = 24 pages left.

He has 4 days to finish, so he needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day. 


6
"
"Okay, so John drinks water with every meal, which is four times a day. He does this for five weekdays, so that's 4 times 5, which is 20 glasses. On the weekend, he skips the water at dinner and has soda instead, so he only drinks 3 glasses a day on Saturday and Sunday. That's 3 times 2, which is 6 glasses.  In total, he drinks 20 plus 6 glasses, which is 26 glasses of water in a week.


26 

"
"Okay, so the fog covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.  The city is 42 miles wide, so that's 42 / 3 = 14 sections of 3 miles each.

If each section takes 10 minutes, then it'll take 14 * 10 = 140 minutes for the whole city to be covered in fog. 


140 

"
"Okay, so Poppy does a quarter of the puzzle, which is 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces. That leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces.  Then her mom does a third of what's left, which is 750 / 3 = 250 pieces.  

So in total, they've put down 250 + 250 = 500 pieces. That means there are 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces left.


500 

"
"Okay, so Cody eats three times the amount of cookies Amir eats, and Amir eats 5. That means Cody eats 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.  

To find the total, we add the number of cookies each person eats: 15 + 5 = 20 cookies.


20 

"
"Okay, so John has three boxes, and we need to find the total space inside all of them.  Each box is 5 by 6 by 4 inches on the outside, but the walls are 1 inch thick. That means we need to figure out the space inside where you could actually put stuff.

If the walls are 1 inch thick, the inside of each box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches.  To find the volume, we multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since he has three boxes, the total space inside is 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.


72 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Frankie watched 2 hours of TV on Monday and Tuesday combined. Then he watched 1.5 hours on Thursday. And on Friday, he watched 2 more hours. That's a total of 5.5 hours.

Since he watched 7 hours total, he must have watched 1.5 hours on Wednesday (7 - 5.5 = 1.5).

Each 30-minute show is half an hour, so he watched 3 episodes on Wednesday (1.5 / 0.5 = 3). 


3 

"
"Okay, so let's break this down. Henry has 110 cookies now, but he dropped 5, so he had 110 + 5 = 115 before that.  He also made 15 extra cookies, so he meant to bake 115 - 15 = 100 cookies. Since he wanted to double the amount from last year, he baked 100 / 2 = 50 cookies last year.


50 

"
"Okay, so the gas costs $3.00 per gallon, and they get $0.20 back for each gallon.  If they buy 10 gallons, that's 10 * $3.00 = $30.00 before the cashback. Then they get 10 * $0.20 = $2.00 back. So the gas will cost $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.


$28.00 

"
"Okay, so Beatrice ate 2 times 24 roll-ups, which is 48. Marcell ate 3 times 14 roll-ups, which is 42.  That means they ate a total of 48 + 42 = 90 roll-ups. Since there are two of them, they ate an average of 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups each.


45 

"
"Okay, so Julia's boat is leaking, which is bad! Let's see... it takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet she rows.  

First, we need to figure out how far she rows. She rows for 64 seconds and covers 20 feet every 16 seconds, so she rows a total of 64 / 16 * 20 = 80 feet.

Since it takes on 2 liters every 10 feet, over 80 feet it takes on 80 / 10 * 2 = 16 liters of water. 


16 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 teachers, and each one uses the whiteboard for 2 lessons a day. That means the whiteboard gets used 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 times a day.

And since it gets cleaned 3 times every lesson, it's cleaned 8 times * 3 cleanings/time = 24 times a day.


24 

"
"Okay, so Ryan plants 2 flowers each day for 15 days, that's 2 * 15 = 30 flowers. But 5 of them didn't grow, so he has 30 - 5 = 25 flowers. 


25 

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.

Jamal's phone holds way more pictures than Brittany's – like six times more!  We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures. So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 / 6 = 300 pictures.

The problem says Brittany's phone capacity is 50 times bigger than the number of ducks in Jamal's picture. That means there are 300 / 50 = 6 ducks in the photo. 


6
"
"Okay, so Sasha bought some lumber a while back, and now it's more expensive.  She wants to sell her leftovers and make some money.

Let's see... she has ten 2x4 boards that she bought for $10 each, so that's 10 * $10 = $100.  

She also has five 4x4 boards that cost $16 each, so that's 5 * $16 = $80.

That means she spent a total of $100 + $80 = $180 on the lumber.

Now, prices went up 50%, so she can sell the 2x4s for $10 * 1.50 = $15 each. That's $15 * 10 = $150 for all of them.

The 4x4s can be sold for $16 * 1.50 = $24 each. That's $24 * 5 = $120 for all of them.

So, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270 from selling everything.

If she subtracts her original cost, she makes a profit of $270 - $180 = $90.


$90
"
"Okay, so Katy uses sugar and water in a 7:13 ratio. That means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to figure out how much of that 120 is just sugar.

First, add the ratio parts: 7 + 13 = 20.

Then, divide the total amount (120) by the total ratio parts (20): 120 / 20 = 6. This means each ""part"" of the ratio is equal to 6.

Finally, multiply the sugar ratio (7) by the value of one ratio part (6): 7 * 6 = 42.


So Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar. 

"
"Okay, so John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 kids. That's 2 * 3 = 6 pairs of shoes total.

Since each pair costs $60, he spent 6 * $60 = $360. 


$360 

"
"Okay, so on the first day they had 2 containers with 5 cars each, that's 2 * 5 = 10 cars.

If they had 30 cars total on the second day, then they got 30 - 10 = 20 more cars.

Since each container has 5 cars, they must have gotten 20 / 5 = 4 more containers. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Adrien made 30% more than Lylah, which means if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  We know Adrien made $40,000 four years ago, so that must be his $130.  

To find out what Lylah made four years ago, we can set up a proportion: 130/100 = $40,000/x.  Solving for x, we get Lylah made about $30,769.23 four years ago.

Adrien's salary went up by 40%, so four years later he's making $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000.

Lylah's salary also went up, so four years later she's making $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.30) = $40,000.

Finally, to find their total salary, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries: $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.


$96,000
"
"Okay, so Miguel uses 2 pads a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. That means he uses 2 * 30 = 60 sheets every week.  

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he uses 60 * 4 = 240 sheets a month. 

240 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Morisette has 5 apples + 8 oranges = 13 fruits. Kael has twice Morisette's apples, so he has 5 * 2 = 10 apples. He has half her oranges, so he has 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. That means Kael has 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.

Together they have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits. 


27
"
"Okay, so Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. Then she slept 2 hours less each of the next two days, so that's 8 - 2 = 6 hours each night. That's a total of 6 + 6 = 12 hours for those two days.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those 6 hours, meaning she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night. Since there are 4 more days left in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Finally, to find her total sleep for the whole week, we add up all the hours: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, so Rosie runs super fast at first!  She can do 10 miles every hour for 3 hours, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 miles already.

After that, she slows down to 5 miles per hour. She runs for another 4 hours (7 total hours - 3 hours), so that's 5 * 4 = 20 more miles.

In total, she runs 30 + 20 = 50 miles. 


50
"
"Okay, so Jennie stamped a third of the 60 letters, which is 60 / 3 = 20 letters.  That means there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters in the stamped pile to begin with. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Julia ended up with 12 spoons. Her husband gave her 5, and she used 3 while cooking, so before that she had 12 - 5 + 3 = 10 spoons.  That means the package she bought had 10 spoons. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Dylan had 38 chicken sausages. He got 6 more fish sausages, so that's 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.  In total, he bought 38 + 44 = 82 sausages. 


82
"
"Okay, so Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more than that, so she made 70 friends.  To find the total, we add their friends together: 50 + 70 = 120.


120 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, and a pepper is $15, so a watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.
* An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so it costs $45 - $5 = $40.
* Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.
* He buys 20 peppers at $15 each, so that's 20 * $15 = $300.
* He buys 10 oranges at $40 each, so that's 10 * $40 = $400.

Adding it all up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

So Dillon spends $880 at the store. 



"
"Okay, so the hospital sees 500 people a day, and each person is there for 24 minutes. That's a total of 12,000 minutes (500 x 24).  

To figure out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 minutes per hour, so that's 200 hours.

The doctors get paid $150 an hour, so that's $30,000 for the day (200 x 150).

The hospital charges patients $200 an hour, so they make $40,000 (200 x 200).

To find the profit, we subtract the doctor's cost from what the hospital makes: $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.


$10,000
"
"Okay, so first, a third of the elves quit because of the vomit, which is 60 / 3 = 20 elves.  That leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves. Then 10 more quit because of the shin-kicking, so there are 40 - 10 = 30 elves left.


30 

"
"Okay, so Joseph spent $500 in May. In June, he spent $60 less, so that's $500 - $60 = $440.  To find the total, we add his spending for both months: $500 + $440 = $940.


$940 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Pam rode the roller coaster twice and Fred rode it four times, so that's 2 + 4 = 6 roller coaster rides total.  They each rode the luge twice, so that's another 2 + 2 = 4 luge rides.

That means they had a total of 6 + 4 = 10 rides.

Since each ride costs 6 tickets, they used 10 * 6 = 60 tickets.


60 

"
"Okay, so Walt walked 4 miles on Monday and then 6 times that amount on Tuesday, which is 4 * 6 = 24 miles.  That means he walked a total of 4 + 24 = 28 miles on Monday and Tuesday.  Since his total for Monday through Wednesday was 41 miles, he must have walked 41 - 28 = 13 miles on Wednesday.


13 

"
"Okay, so Tom gets 4 car washes a month and each one costs $15.  That means he spends 4 * $15 = $60 every month on car washes.

Over a whole year, that's $60/month * 12 months = $720. 


720 

"
"Okay, so Brian had 20 games but lost 5, leaving him with 15.  Bobby has 3 times that amount minus 5, so that's (3 * 15) - 5 = 40 games.

40 

"
"Okay, so there are 27 unicorns total, and a third of them are in Scotland. That's 27 / 3 = 9 unicorns.  

Then, two-thirds of those Scottish unicorns are female, so that's 9 * (2/3) = 6 female unicorns.


6 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

The subs cost 2 * $7.50 = $15.00.

The chips are 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.

The cookies are 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.

So, the food alone is $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

The delivery fee is 20% of $20.00, which is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.

That brings the total to $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, she adds a $5.00 tip, making the final cost $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00. 


$29.00
"
"Okay, so Mark took two tests. The first one had 75 questions, and he could do 5 questions every hour. He had 8 hours for that test, so he finished 5 * 8 = 40 questions. That means he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions unfinished on the first test.

The second test had 100 questions, and he again did 5 questions per hour, but this time he only had 6 hours. So he finished 5 * 6 = 30 questions on the second test, leaving 100 - 30 = 70 questions unfinished.

In total, he left 35 + 70 = 105 questions unfinished.


105 

"
"Okay, so there are four times as many pink gumballs as blue gumballs, plus 22 more.  That means we need to multiply the number of blue gumballs (12) by 4 and then add 22.

12 * 4 = 48
48 + 22 = 70

There are 70 pink gumballs. 



"
"Okay, so there are 20 cars in total.  12 are automatic and 4 are manual. That means 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars are semi-automatic.

To find the percentage, we do (4 semi-automatic cars / 20 total cars) * 100% = 20%

20 

"
"Okay, so there are 700 bees total.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queen bees.  

Let's think about it like this: if we had 1 queen bee, there would be 2 baby bees, and then 4 worker bees (twice the babies). That's a total of 7 bees.

Since we have 700 bees, we need to figure out how many groups of 7 that is. 700 divided by 7 is 100.

So there must be 100 queen bees. That means there are 200 baby bees (100 x 2) and 400 worker bees (200 x 2).


**Answer:** 400 

"
"Okay, so Jordan plays video games for 2 hours a day. If he worked those 2 hours instead, he'd make $10 an hour, so that's $20 a day.  If he did that for a whole week, he'd make $20 a day times 7 days, which is $140.


140 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.  

The milk and eggs are food, so they don't have extra tax. That's $2 + $3 = $5.

The other stuff - light bulbs, cups, and roach traps -  that's $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

There's a 10% tax on those, so that's $10 * 0.10 = $1 extra.

So the non-food stuff costs $10 + $1 = $11.

Adding it all up, everything costs $5 + $11 = $16. 


$16
"
"Okay, so Kim's got 8 clients total.  Each one needs 2 bottles of bleach at $2 each, so that's $4 per client on bleach.  That's $32 total for bleach (8 clients * $4).  Then he needs cloths, which are $5 a pack, so that's $40 for cloths (8 clients * $5).

His total expenses are $72 ($32 + $40). He makes $92 each week, so his profit is $20 ($92 - $72).


$20 

"
"Okay, so John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and each hectare gives him 100 pineapples. That means he gets 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples each time he harvests.

He harvests every 3 months, so in a year (which has 12 months), he harvests 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 times.

So, in a year, he gets 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples.


4000 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has three times that amount, so it has 500 * 3 = 1500 pieces. The third set has a quarter of the pieces in the first set, meaning it has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

To find the total, we add up the pieces from all three sets: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.


2125 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* First, 30 bees left the hive.
* Then, half that amount, or 15 bees, came back.
* Next, twice the original number, which is 30 bees * 2 = 60 bees, flew out.
* That means a total of 30 bees + 60 bees = 90 bees left the hive during the day.
* Since all the bees that left eventually came back, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours. 


90 

"
"Okay, so Brittany's mom paid for one adult ticket and one child ticket, which costs $12 and $10 respectively. That's a total of $22.  Since she got $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $30. 


$30
"
"Okay, so Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and that's three times more than Dorothy.  That means Dorothy has 12 / 3 = 4 friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so he has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

"
"Okay, so Steve has to go farther, but he's on a bike, which is faster.  Let's figure out how long each of them takes.

First, we need to know how many feet they each have to travel:

* Steve: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
* Tim: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's see how long it takes each of them:

* Steve: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
* Tim: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Looks like Tim takes longer. Steve will be waiting for 4 minutes. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire.  

* She inflated 5 bikes * 2 tires each = 10 tires
* She inflated 3 tricycles * 3 tires each = 9 tires
* And 1 unicycle * 1 tire = 1 tire

That's a total of 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires.

She made 20 tires * $0.25/tire = $5.00 


$5.00
"
"Okay, so Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies, so that's 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.  Each cookie costs a dime, so 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00. If he pays with a ten dollar bill, his change would be $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

* Dave ate 14 fries.
* The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.
* Then the pigeons ate 3 fries each, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* That leaves 21 - 9 = 12 fries.
* The raccoon was a real jerk and took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.
* So there were 12 - 8 = 4 fries left.
* Finally, the ants took 1 fry, leaving 4 - 1 = 3 fries.

Working backwards, there must have been 3 + 1 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries to start with. 


43 

"
"Okay, so Kimo has class three days a week with three one-hour classes each day. That's 3 times 3, which is 9 hours. Then he has two two-hour classes two days a week, so that's 2 times 2 times 2, which equals 8 hours.  

So in total, he has 9 plus 8, which is 17 hours of class each week.  

Over a 16 week semester, that's 17 times 16, which is 272 hours.


272 

"
"Okay, so Bill makes a lot of yummy stuff! Let's see...

* He makes 300 rolls at 4 inches each, so that's 300 * 4 = 1200 inches of rolls.
* The croissants are 6 inches each, and he makes 120, so that's 120 * 6 = 720 inches of croissants.
* The baguettes are tricky because they're in feet.  He makes 60 baguettes at 2 feet each, which is 60 * 2 = 120 feet.  But we need that in inches, so we multiply by 12: 120 * 12 = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add up all the inches: 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches.

Finally, we need to convert that to feet: 3360 / 12 = 280 feet.


280 

"
"Okay, so the monkeys eat 200 bananas a month, the gorillas eat 400, and the baboons eat 100. That's a total of 700 bananas each month.  Since he needs enough for two months, he'd need 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas. 


1400 

"
"Okay, so Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he runs 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.

Kelly runs back and forth once, which is 100 yards. Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. That's like running 80 yards each time (40 yards there and 40 yards back), so she runs 34 * 80 = 2720 yards doing that.  In total, she runs 100 + 2720 = 2820 yards.

Kelly runs 2820 - 1500 = 1320 yards farther than Blake.


1320 

"
"Okay, let's break down Raphael's spending:

* He bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, so that's 4 * $1.50 = $6.00
* He got 2 notebooks at $4.00 each, so that's 2 * $4.00 = $8.00
* And the bond paper cost a flat $20.00

Adding those up: $6.00 + $8.00 + $20.00 = $34.00

"Okay, so Finn starts by seeing 11 tadpoles. Then 6 more pop up, bringing the total to 17. But then 2 of them hide, so he can only see 15 now.

"
"Okay, so on Monday the tank has 17 feet of water. Then on Tuesday, they add 7 more feet, so that's 17 + 7 = 24 feet.  

On Wednesday, the water level is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.  Two-thirds of 24 is (2/3) * 24 = 16 feet.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 seahorses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.

Locsin caught 10 starfish - 5 = 5 starfish.

He also caught 6 seahorses - 3 = 3 seahorses.

And 3 clownfish + 2 = 5 clownfish.

That means Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.

Together they caught 19 + 13 = 32 fish.


32 

"
"Okay, so the price goes up 20% every two months. That means every two months, the bag gets $4 more expensive ($20 x 0.20 = $4).

Let's see... 36 months is 18 sets of two months (36 / 2 = 18).  So the price goes up $4 a total of 18 times.

That's $72 more expensive ($4 x 18 = $72).

So, the bag would cost $92 after 36 months ($20 + $72 = $92). 


$92
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Each action figure costs $5, so 3 of them cost 3 * $5 = $15.
* The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so it's also $15.
* The red cars cost $4 each, and there are 5, so they cost 5 * $4 = $20.

Adding up the cost of everything: $15 + $20 + $15 = $50.


 

"
"Okay, so if Jackie does her own taxes, she loses out on $35 for every hour she could have worked. Since she'd lose 3 hours, that's 3 * $35 = $105.  

The accountant costs $90, so she'd actually save money by doing her taxes herself. She'd have $105 - $90 = $15 more.


$15 

"
"Okay, let's see... Elvira's computer costs €1090.  Then she gets a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102.  

So, the accessories cost €157 + €74 + €102 = €333.

That means the total cost of everything is €1090 + €333 = €1423.

She had €1500, so she'll have €1500 - €1423 = €77 left for clothes. 


€77
"
"Okay, so Sandra needs 45 eggs in total (15 flans * 3 eggs per flan).  Since she gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, she'll need to babysit 5 times (45 eggs / 9 eggs per babysitting session = 5 sessions).


5 

"
"Okay, so Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  That means if Brooke is 'b' years old, Seth is '2b' years old.

In two years, Brooke will be 'b + 2' and Seth will be '2b + 2'.  We know that those two ages added together will equal 28.

So, (b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3b = 24

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old. 


16
"
"Okay, so Ethel has $8.  Twice that amount is $16, and Jimmy has $2 more than that, so he has $18.


$18
"
"Okay, so Pancho walks 20 miles a day during the week, which is 5 days. That's 20 * 5 = 100 miles.

On the weekend he walks less, only 10 miles each day for 2 days, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 miles.

In total, he walks 100 + 20 = 120 miles in a week. 


120 

"
"Okay, so the hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times that, so it's $25 * 3 = $75.  The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so that's ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.  

To find the total cost, we add up the price of the hat, jacket, and pants: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.


$150 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

* There are 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so that's 80 * 8 = 640 legs.
* Then there are 90 insects with 6 legs each, so that's 90 * 6 = 540 legs.
* And finally, 3 mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, which is 3 * 10 = 30 legs.

Adding all those up: 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 legs.


1210 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, meaning she's 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so she's 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all four birds: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

"
"Okay, so Jessica has to pay $300 for student loans, $200 for her credit card, and $500 for her mortgage. That's a total of $1000 every month.

She wants to pay 50% more, so that's like adding another $500 to her payments ($1000 x 0.50 = $500).

So, she's paying $1500 each month ($1000 + $500 = $1500).

Over a whole year, that's $18000 ($1500 x 12 = $18000).


$18000 

"
"Okay, so Billy's got a lot of potatoes to prep!  

Let's see... peeling each potato takes a minute and a half, and that's 60 potatoes, so that's 60 times 1.5, which is 90 minutes just for peeling.

Cutting is way faster, only 5 seconds per potato. So that's 5 times 60, which is 300 seconds.  

But we need that in minutes, so 300 seconds divided by 60 seconds per minute is 5 minutes.

Adding the peeling and cutting time, it takes him 90 minutes plus 5 minutes, which is 95 minutes total. 


95 

"
"Okay, so they make $10 for every gallon they sell because 20 glasses at $0.50 each is $10.  It costs them $5 to make each gallon. That means they make a $5 profit for every gallon.

They made $25 total, so they must have sold 5 gallons ($25 / $5 = 5).

Since lemons cost $3 per gallon, they spent $15 on lemons (5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15).


$15 

"
"Okay, so there are 240 runners total, and 80 of them are Japanese. That means there are 160 Chinese runners (240 - 80 = 160).  If 60 of the Chinese runners are boys, then there must be 100 girls on the Chinese team (160 - 60 = 100).


100 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Zaid makes $6000 a month.

* Rent takes up a quarter of that: $6000 / 4 = $1500
* Car fuel is another third: $6000 / 3 = $2000
* So far, that's $1500 + $2000 = $3500 spent.

* He has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.
* He gives half of that to charity: $2500 / 2 = $1250

* Now he's spent $3500 + $1250 = $4750
* Don't forget his daughter gets $200 and his wife gets $700: $4750 + $200 + $700 = $5650

* Finally, subtract that from his total earnings: $6000 - $5650 = $350


Zaid has $350 left over. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more than Monic, meaning Rani has 46 crabs.

To find the total, we add up the number of crabs each person has: 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.


122 

"
"Okay, so Lloyd makes $10 for every hour he tutors.  In the first week he tutored for 5 hours, so he made 10 * 5 = $50.  The second week he tutored for 8 hours, so he made 10 * 8 = $80.  To find out how much he made in total, we add those two amounts together: $50 + $80 = $130.


$130 

"
"Okay, so the winner got 3/4 of the votes, which means the loser got the rest.  If 80 students voted, the winner got 60 votes (3/4 * 80 = 60). That means the loser got 20 votes (80 - 60 = 20).


20 

"
"Okay, so Sandra ordered a bunch of flowers.  She got 200 pink calla lilies, and those were five times the number of white carnations she ordered. That means she got 200 / 5 = 40 white carnations.

She ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so she got 4 * 40 = 160 red roses.

Fred needs to deliver those 160 red roses by 5 pm! 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

If Jan is 30 now, two years ago she was 28.  Half of Jan's age two years ago was 14.  Mark was 5 years older than that, so he was 19 two years ago. That means Mark is 21 now. Since Jean is two years older than Mark, she's 23.


23 

"
"Okay, so Team 1 is super consistent, each runner does it in 55 seconds. That's 55 times 4, which is 220 seconds total.

Team 2 is trickier. The first runner is slow at 60 seconds. Then they get faster by 3 seconds each time. So the second runner is 57, the third is 54, and the last one is 51.  If you add those up (60 + 57 + 54 + 51) it's 222 seconds.

Team 1 is faster by 2 seconds! 


2 

"
"Okay, so Jerry has a 50/50 chance of rolling a number bigger than 3, right?  There are three numbers bigger than 3 (4, 5, and 6) and six sides total.

To get two even numbers in a row, he has to get an even number first, which is a 50% chance. Then he has to get *another* even number, which is also a 50% chance. So that's 50% times 50% which equals 25%.

That means it's 25% more likely he'll roll a number bigger than 3. 


25
"
"Okay, so Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half that amount. That means Jenna picked 20 / 2 = 10 apples.  

To find the total, we add the number of apples each of them picked: 20 + 10 = 30 apples.


30 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

First, we know the hamsters used 50 pieces of straw (10 hamsters * 5 pieces each). The rabbits used 20 pieces. That means the rats used 90 pieces of straw (160 total - 50 - 20 = 90).

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there are 15 rats total (90 pieces / 6 pieces per rat = 15 rats).

If the rats are in 3 cages, there must be 5 rats in each cage (15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage).


5 

"
"Okay, so Mandy owes Benedict $100, and there's a 2% interest added each month.  After one month, she'd owe $102. Then the next month it'd be $104.04, and after three months it would be $106.12.


$106.12 

"
"Okay, so the trader buys the wheat for $20 a bag and then has to pay another $2 to move each bag. That means each bag costs him $22 total before he sells it.  He sells them for $30 each, so he makes $8 profit on every bag.  If he made $400 profit total, he must have sold 50 bags. 


50
"
"Okay, so they spent $20.25 on tickets and $4.50 less on food, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.  The rides cost $33 each, and they went on two, so that's $33 x 2 = $66.

In total, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each person paid $102 / 3 = $34. 


$34
"
"Okay, so John collects peaches for 3 hours, and he gets 2 peaches every minute.  That means in one hour he gets 2 peaches/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 120 peaches.  

Over 3 hours, he'd collect 120 peaches/hour * 3 hours = 360 peaches.


360 

"
"Okay, so if each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects a week, and there are 10 ducks, that's 3.5 times 10, which is 35 pounds total.  

Then, since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total pounds by 7: 35 pounds / 7 days = 5 pounds per day. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Tom starts with 50 trees. Each year he adds 10 and takes away 2, so that's a net gain of 8 trees per year.

Over 10 years, that's 8 trees/year * 10 years = 80 more trees.

So he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

But then 30% of them die, which is 130 trees * 0.30 = 39 trees.

That leaves him with 130 - 39 = 91 trees. 


91 

"
"Okay, so here's how I'd figure this out:

They start with 18 pink flamingos. Then they take away a third, which is 18 / 3 = 6 flamingos. That leaves 18 - 6 = 12 pink ones.

They paint those 6 flamingos white and put them back, so now there are 12 pink and 6 white.

Finally, they add another 18 pink flamingos, making a total of 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.

So there are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white ones.


24 

"
"Okay, so Violetta wants 5 crayons at $2 each. That means they'll cost 5 * $2 = $10.  Since she has $20, she'll get $20 - $10 = $10 in change. 


$10
"
"Okay, so a pen costs the same as a pencil plus an eraser.  The pencil is $1.20 and the eraser is $0.30, so the pen costs $1.50.  If each pen costs $1.50, then 8 pens would cost $12.00.


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 200 pounds of carrots and need to give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants.  That means they'll use 40 * 2 = 80 pounds of carrots.  

That leaves 200 - 80 = 120 pounds of carrots leftover. 


120 

"
"Okay, so there are 23,786 people in Soda.  If 8417 are men and 9092 are women, that means there are 8417 + 9092 = 17,509 adults.  

To find out how many kids there are, we subtract the adults from the total population: 23,786 - 17,509 = 6277 kids.


6277 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Elaine starts with 20 cards. Then she gets three times that amount, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 more cards. That brings her total to 20 + 60 = 80 cards.

The next month she gets 20 fewer than the 60 she got before, so she gets 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Now she has 80 + 40 = 120 cards.

In the last month, she doubles the amount she got in the first two months combined, which is 60 + 40 = 100 cards. Doubling that is 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

Finally, we add up all the cards: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.


320 

"
"Okay, so Mark edits 1000 sentences a week, and half of those are for Publisher A. That's 500 sentences. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 500 * $0.05 = $25 from them.

Publisher B pays him double, so they pay him 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence. He also edits 500 sentences for them, so he makes 500 * $0.10 = $50 from Publisher B.

In total, he makes $25 + $50 = $75 a week.  That's 7500 cents.


7500 

"
"Okay, so Baldur gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 in the afternoon, that's 11 pails total.  Each pail has 5 liters, so he gets 11 * 5 = 55 liters of water every day. 

55 

"
"Okay, so John gets a $5000 bonus right off the bat, that's awesome!  Then his salary goes up by 5%, so his raise is $2000 times 0.05 which is $100 extra each week.  That means he makes $2100 a week now.  

There are 52 weeks in a year, so his new yearly salary is $2100 times 52, which is $109,200.  

Don't forget to add the bonus!  So in total, he made $109,200 + $5000 = $114,200 that year.


114200 

"
"Okay, so Josie has 10 acres of grapes, and each acre makes 5 tons of grapes. That's 10 * 5 = 50 tons of grapes total.

Then, each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, so she gets 50 * 2 = 100 barrels of wine. 


100 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Carl eats 2 slices of cheese on his sandwich each day, and he eats a sandwich every day for a week, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

He also eats omelets with cheese 3 days a week. Each omelet has one more slice than his sandwich, meaning each omelet has 2 + 1 = 3 slices.  So, the omelets use 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

Finally, the macaroni and cheese uses 8 slices.

Adding it all up: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese. 


31
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  Janet starts with 22 green + 10 yellow = 32 pens.

Then she gets 6 bags of blue pens * 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens.

She also gets 2 bags of red pens * 6 pens per bag = 12 red pens.

That means she has 54 blue + 12 red = 66 new pens.

In total, she has 32 original pens + 66 new pens = 98 pens. 


98 

"
"Okay, so Brinley wants a 93 average across six tests.  That means she needs a total of 93 x 6 = 558 points.

She's already got 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438 points.

To get to 558, she needs 558 - 438 = 120 points on her last test.


120 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time, so that's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers per week. He did that for four weeks, so that's 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then he switched to riding 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time, meaning he rode 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week. He did this for three weeks, so that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

In total, Micheal rode 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.


860 

"
"Okay, so Joe has a lot of candy!  Let's see... each chocolate bar is 40 grams, and there are 25 of those. That's 40 * 25 = 1000 grams just from the chocolate.

The candied apples are lighter, though. Each one is half the weight of a chocolate bar, so they're 40 / 2 = 20 grams each. With 80 candied apples, that's 20 * 80 = 1600 grams.

Finally, we add the weight of the chocolate and the apples: 1000 + 1600 = 2600 grams.

So Joe's bag weighs 2600 grams. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
* On Tuesday, she bought three times that amount, so 4 cakes * 3 = 12 cakes.
* On Wednesday, she bought five times the amount she bought on Tuesday, meaning 12 cakes * 5 = 60 cakes.

To find the total, we add up the cakes from each day: 4 cakes + 12 cakes + 60 cakes = 76 cakes.


76 

"
"Okay, so twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates.  Half a dozen plates would cost $6000 * 0.5 = $3000.  That means the cups cost $3000 - $1200 = $1800. Since there are 20 dozen cups, and a dozen has 12, that's 20 * 12 = 240 cups.  So each cup costs $1800 / 240 = $7.50. 


$7.50
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The jacket costs $30, and the shoes are $20 each, so that's $20 x 2 = $40 for the shoes.  In total, everything costs $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved and made $20 babysitting, for a total of $10 + $20 = $30.

She needs $70 - $30 = $40 more.

If she earns $4 per lawn mowing, she needs to mow $40 / $4 = 10 lawns.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens.

We know a few things:

* White chickens lay 5 eggs a day, red chickens lay 3.
* Jerry gets 42 eggs total each day.
* He has 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

So, we can write these as equations:

* w = r + 2  (two more white chickens)
* 3r + 5w = 42 (total eggs)

Now, let's substitute the first equation into the second one to get rid of 'w':

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify that:

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has **4** red chickens. 

"
"Okay, so the park is a rectangle, right?  To find out how far Gary walks, we need to find the distance all the way around it. That's called the perimeter.  

You find the perimeter of a rectangle by adding up all the sides: 1.5 miles + 6 miles + 1.5 miles + 6 miles = 15 miles.

Since he walks at 3 miles per hour, we divide the total distance by his speed: 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, so Sloane saw 100 people on the first day and 50 more on the second day, which is 150 people. That means in the first two days she saw 100 + 150 = 250 people.  If she saw 500 people total, then on the third day she must have seen 500 - 250 = 250 people.


250 

"
"Okay, so this is a bit of a tricky word problem. Let's break it down.

We know both pools are losing water at the same rate, 4 gallons every minute.  

Let's say the small pool has 'x' gallons of water right now. That means the big pool has 4x gallons right now.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, the big pool had 2x gallons, and the small pool also had 'x' gallons.

Since both pools lose 4 gallons per minute, the big pool lost 16 gallons in those four minutes (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = 16 gallons). The small pool also lost 16 gallons.

This means four minutes ago, the big pool had 2x + 16 gallons, and the small pool had x + 16 gallons.

We know that four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much as the small pool, so:

2x + 16 = 4x

Subtract 2x from both sides: 16 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2: x = 8

So, the small pool has 8 gallons of water now. 



"
"Okay, so Lori needs to make $352.00 to buy the shoes and belt. If she makes $8.00 an hour, she'll need to work 44 hours. 



"
"Okay, so Janeth borrowed $2000 and has to pay back 10% extra, which is $200.  That means she owes a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll pay a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

So, after a year, she'll still owe $2200 - $1980 = $220.


$220 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 roses, and there are 7 more dahlias than roses. That means there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  In total, there are 4 + 11 = 15 flowers in the vase. 

15 

"
"Okay, so Harriet is 21 now. Adrian is three times her age, which is 3 * 21 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  To find the average, we add those ages up (24 + 66 + 45 = 135) and then divide by 3, which gives us 45. 


45 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so he got (68 / 2) + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Since the four students scored a total of 251 points, Jojo must have scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.


54 

"
"Okay, so Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword and she did 3 of those, so that's 30 minutes (10 x 3 = 30).  Then she does sudoku puzzles in 5 minutes each and did 8 of those, for a total of 40 minutes (5 x 8 = 40).  Adding those together, she spent 70 minutes on puzzles (30 + 40 = 70).


70 

"
"Okay, so Celine started with 120 liters and used 90 liters, leaving her with 30 liters.  Then she collected double that amount in rainwater, which is 60 liters.  Adding that to the 30 liters she already had gives us a total of 90 liters in the tank.


90 

"
"Okay, so Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias, meaning he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  

To find the total, we add the geraniums and petunias: 90 + 50 = 140 flowers.


140 

"
"Okay, so they spent $15000 the first year.  The next year they spent a third of that, which is $15000 divided by 3, or $5000.  To find the total, we add the two years together: $15000 + $5000 = $20000.


$20000 

"
"Okay, so Carlos spends $30 per hour for 3 hours, which is $30 * 3 = $90. Benji spends $18 per hour for 5 hours, so that's $18 * 5 = $90.  

To find the total, we add their costs: $90 + $90 = $180.


180 

"
"Okay, so Andrew takes 6 days to get to Rochester by bus.  Driving is twice as fast, so that would take him 6 / 2 = 3 days.  

Since he's going by bus and coming back by car, the total trip is 6 + 3 = 9 days. 


9 

"
"Okay, so James starts with 40 water Pokemon cards, but loses 8, leaving him with 32. He also gets 14 more grass cards, bringing his total to 34.  

That means he has 30 fire + 34 grass + 32 water = 96 cards total.

To find the percentage chance of picking a water card, we do (number of water cards / total cards) * 100%.

So, (32 / 96) * 100% = 33.33%. Rounding that to the nearest whole number gives us 33%.


33 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The burrito itself costs $6.50. Then he adds $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, and $1.00 for avocado.  The sauces are $0.25 each, and he gets two, so that's $0.25 x 2 = $0.50.  

He also wants the meal upgrade for $3.00. So far, that's $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00.

But wait, he has a $5.00 gift card!  

That means he owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.


$9.00
"
"Okay, so Kalinda puts in 4 puzzle pieces every minute, and her mom does half of that, which is 2 pieces per minute.  Together they do 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so it will take them 360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes.

That's equal to 1 hour. 


1 

"
"Okay, so here's how I'd figure this out:

First, 30% of the watermelons were ready at first, so that's 120 * 0.30 = 36 watermelons.

That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Then, 3/4 of those were ready two weeks later, which is (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons.

So, there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left that weren't ready. 


21
"
"Okay, so Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each, so that's 12 times 20,000 which is $240,000.  Then he has to pay 10% tax on that, so that's $24,000 in tax.  Adding those together, the cars cost $264,000.  But wait, there's more! He also has to pay $1000 to register each car, and since he has 12 cars, that's another $12,000.  So in total, Mark pays $264,000 plus $12,000 which is $276,000.


$276,000
"
"Okay, so Kylie got 5 more shells than Robert on Monday, who found 20. That means Kylie found 20 + 5 = 25 shells.

Then on Tuesday, she doubled her Monday amount, so she found 25 * 2 = 50 shells.


50 

"
"Okay, so Dax found half as many bugs as ants, and there were 50 ants. That means there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.  

To find the total number of insects, we add the ants and bugs: 50 + 25 = 75 insects.


75 

"
"Okay, so a third of the penguins went swimming, and another third went into the cave. That means 2/3 of the penguins left the sunbathing spot.  

To find out how many are left, we need to figure out what 2/3 of 36 is.  

That's like saying (2/3) * 36 = 24 penguins.

So, 36 - 24 = 12 penguins are still sunbathing. 


12 

"
"Okay, so Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, which is 3.  That means they eat a total of 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day.

In a week, that's 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes.

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, so Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines. 


21 

"
"Okay, so John needs enough pizza for 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices. That's 20 * 4 = 80 slices in total.  Since each pizza has 8 slices, he'll need to order 80 / 8 = 10 pizzas. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Ram can make a new pen out of five empty ones.  If he has 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.  

That means he'll have his original 25 plus the 5 new ones, for a total of 30 pens. 


30 

"
"Okay, so Johnny starts with $20 and adds $10, giving him $30. If that triples, he'd have $30 * 3 = $90. 


$90
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, who is 20. That makes Joan 25. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so she's 23.

To find the total, we add their ages: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68


68 

"
"Okay, so 30% of the students left through exit A, which is 300 students (30/100 * 1000 = 300). That leaves 700 students (1000 - 300 = 700).

Then, 3/5 of those 700 students left through exit B, which is 420 students (3/5 * 700 = 420).

That means 280 students must have left through exit C (700 - 420 = 280).


280 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

John has 54 candies, and that's twice the amount Robert has. So Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

James has 6 more candies than Robert, meaning he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Finally, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract: 54 - 33 = 21 candies.


21 

"
"Okay, so Dolly has two books and Pandora has one. If they each read their own books and then swap, they'll each read a total of three books.  Since there are two of them, they'll read a total of 6 books. 


6 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but stopped talking to 2, so he has 3 left.  Each of those pen pals sends him 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back, so that's 6 letters he gets and 6 letters he sends, for a total of 12 letters.

Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages he writes and receives every week.

If he writes a page every 6 minutes, then he spends 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes writing each week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours writing each week. 


6
"
"Okay, so Jason gets 1000 minutes a month. He uses 15 minutes every day for his boss, so that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.  He also used another 300 minutes, for a total of 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.

That means he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left. 


250
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Griffin starts with 24 fries. Kyle takes 5, and Billy takes twice that amount, which is 10 fries. So together they take 15 fries (5 + 10 = 15).

That leaves Griffin with 9 fries (24 - 15 = 9). Then Colby takes 2 fries (3 less than Kyle's 5).  That means Griffin has 11 fries left (9 + 2 = 11).

Since Griffin ends up with 27 fries, Ginger must have given him 16 fries (27 - 11 = 16).


**Answer:** 16 

"
"Okay, so there's a difference of 28 snails between the two aquariums (32 - 4 = 28).  The problem says that difference is twice the number of fish in each tank.  That means there are 14 fish in each aquarium (28 / 2 = 14). 


14 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out. Her makeup costs $250 per hour, and it takes 6 hours each day, so that's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day.

She needs it done 4 days a week, so that's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.

The movie is 5 weeks long, so the total cost before any discount is $6000 * 5 = $30000.

But wait, there's a 10% discount! That means she saves $30000 * 0.10 = $3000.

So, the final price Jean pays is $30000 - $3000 = $27000. 



"
"Okay, so Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on the party.  Since she's splitting the cost with her two parents, that means there are three people paying.  So, each person pays $96 / 3 = $32. 


$32
"
"Okay, so the chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag has 50 pounds of onions. That's a total of 4 * 50 = 200 pounds of onions.

Since each pound costs $1.50, the chef spent 200 * $1.50 = $300.00 on onions. 


$300.00
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Sue's cookie consumption is based on how many her sister eats. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times the amount her sister did, who ate 5 cookies. So Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate double her sister's amount, who ate 13 cookies. That means Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

Now, each cookie has 200 calories.  Let's find out how many calories Sue ate each day:

* Monday: 20 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 4000 calories
* Tuesday: 26 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 5200 calories

Her sister ate:

* Monday: 5 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 1000 calories
* Tuesday: 13 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 2600 calories

To find the total calories for each, we add the daily amounts:

* Sue: 4000 calories + 5200 calories = 9200 calories
* Sister: 1000 calories + 2600 calories = 3600 calories

Finally, to see how many more calories Sue ate, we subtract her sister's total from Sue's total: 9200 calories - 3600 calories = 5600 calories.



5600
"
"Okay, so there are 60 students total (20 per class times 3 classes).  Since it's half boys and half girls, there are 30 of each.  The first two classes have 27 girls (15 + 12), which means the third class has 3 girls (30 total girls - 27). That leaves 17 spots for boys in the third class (20 total students - 3 girls).


17 

"
"Okay, so Travis starts with 61 apps. He gets rid of 9, so that leaves him with 61 - 9 = 52 apps. Then he adds 18 more, bringing his total to 52 + 18 = 70 apps. 

70 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Last night Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so he killed 3 * (number of cougars today) wolves. He also killed three fewer cougars today than yesterday, meaning he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today.

That means he killed 12 * 3 = 36 wolves today.

In total, he killed 10 + 36 = 46 wolves.

He killed a total of 15 + 12 = 27 cougars.

Adding those together, Rick killed 46 + 27 = 73 animals. 


73
"
"Okay, so Bill starts on the 3rd floor.  He goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6 more.  So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then adding 6 makes it 18. 

Bill is now on the 18th floor. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than that, so she went down 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times. That means Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down 4 times as many times as Anne, so he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times.


84 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, that's 10 * 20 = 200 cows total. Then Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows, so now there are 200 + 40 = 240 cows.  He puts the new cows in all 20 stalls evenly, so each stall has 240 / 20 = 12 cows.  

If we want to know how many cows are in 8 stalls, we multiply: 8 * 12 = 96 cows.


96 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

* He's got 100 pennies, which is just a dollar.
* The 40 nickels are worth $2.00 (40 x $0.05 = $2.00).
* His 20 dimes add another $2.00 (20 x $0.10 = $2.00).
* And those 40 dollar bills are obviously worth $40.00.

Adding it all up: $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

So Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank. 



"
"Okay, so the redwood is 200 feet tall and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. That means there are 20 sections (200 / 10 = 20).  

So the whole tree originally weighed 8000 pounds (20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds).

But termites ate 30% of it.  30% of 8000 is 2400 pounds (8000 * 0.30 = 2400).

That means the redwood now weighs 5600 pounds (8000 - 2400 = 5600).


5600 

"
"Okay, so Nancy has 8 books that are each 50 cents overdue. That's 8 times 50 cents, which is $4.00.  Then she has to pay an extra $2.00 because some of the books are more than a week late. So in total, she owes $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.


$6.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Andrea has 52 apples and 8 more than that is how many apples Jamal has, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half the number of bananas Jamal has, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

To find the total, we add up all the fruit: Andrea's apples (52) + Andrea's bananas (24) + Jamal's apples (44) + Jamal's bananas (48) = 168 fruits.


168 

"
"Okay, so Carla needs two cups of flour for every dozen cookies.  She's making 36 cookies today and 30 tomorrow, for a total of 66 cookies. That's 66 divided by 12, which is 5.5 dozen cookies.  Since she needs 2 cups per dozen, she'll need 5.5 times 2 cups of flour, which is 11 cups. 


11 

"
"Okay, so there are 9300 pennies total.  Two-thirds of them would be 9300 times 2 divided by 3, which is 6200 pennies.  Since there are 100 pennies in a dollar, that's 6200 divided by 100, which equals $62.00. 


$62.00
"
"Okay, so Maddison starts with 5 boxes of marbles, and each box has 50 marbles. That's 5 * 50 = 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more from her friend, so she has 250 + 20 = 270 marbles in total. 


270
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half that amount, which is 6 / 2 = 3 trees. Harry has 5 more than twice the number Ferdinand has. Twice the number Ferdinand has is 3 * 2 = 6 trees.  So Harry has 6 + 5 = 11 trees. That means Harry has 11 - 3 = 8 more trees than Ferdinand.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen's $100, so she has $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha's $125, meaning she has $175.  To find the total, we add up what each girl has: $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.


400 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Cruz has a budget of $400,000.  The house costs $350,000, but there's also a 5% brokerage fee and a 12% transfer fee.

Let's figure out those fees:

* Brokerage fee: 5% of $350,000 is $17,500 (5/100 * $350,000 = $17,500)
* Transfer fee: 12% of $350,000 is $42,000 (12/100 * $350,000 = $42,000)

Now, add those fees to the house price: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Uh oh, that's more than her budget!  

To see how much more, subtract her budget from the total cost: $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

The house is $9,500 over her budget. 


$9,500
"
"Okay, so Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000.  He had to pay 3% for transfer fees, which is $12,000 (because 3/100 * $400,000 = $12,000). Then he had to pay a brokerage fee of 5%, which is $20,000 (because 5/100 * $400,000 = $20,000).

So, in total, those fees are $32,000 ($12,000 + $20,000). He also had to pay off the rest of his loan, which was $250,000.

That means his total expenses were $282,000 ($32,000 + $250,000).

To find out how much money he actually made, we subtract his expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.


$118,000
"
"Okay, so first the oil heats up for 20 minutes to get to 300 degrees. Then it takes 40% longer to get to 400 degrees, so that's 20 times 0.40 which is 8 more minutes.  

So, it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up.

Cooking takes 5 minutes less than heating, so that's 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.

In total, that's 28 minutes heating + 23 minutes cooking = 51 minutes. 


51 

"
"Okay, so he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and got 50 of those, so that's 50 times 5 which is $250.  Then the TV ads were $75 each and he got 15, so that's 75 times 15 which is $1125.  To find the total, we add those together: $250 + $1125 = $1375.


$1375
"
"Okay, so half of the 16 balls are golf balls, which is 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls.  Then, half of those golf balls are blue, meaning there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls. 


4 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

The second bag has 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.

The third bag has 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.

Adding them all up: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms


762 

"
"Okay, so John has two houses, and each house has three bedrooms.  If each bedroom has two windows, that's 2 houses * 3 bedrooms/house * 2 windows/bedroom = 12 windows.

But wait, there are also 4 extra windows in each house that aren't in bedrooms, so that's 2 houses * 4 windows/house = 8 more windows.

Adding those together, John has a total of 12 windows + 8 windows = 20 windows in his houses.


20 

"
"Okay, so she spends $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00 in total.  If she pays with $20.00, her change is $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00.


$5.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice the stitches of the collar, meaning it takes 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

So far, we have 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches used.

That leaves 1800 total stitches - 1170 stitches = 630 stitches for both sleeves.

Each sleeve takes 630 stitches / 2 = 315 stitches.


315 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, which is 20 * $40 = $800.  She also got 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, so that's 80 * $30 = $2400.  To find the total, we add those together: $800 + $2400 = $3200.


$3200 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

His song has 54 lines. The first scene has twice that many lines, which is 54 * 2 = 108 lines. But he only has to memorize a third of those, so that's 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, meaning it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. He has to memorize four-fifths of those, which is 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

In total, he needs to memorize 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines. 


138
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

First, Carly has 80 cards and 2/5 of them have the letter A, so that's 32 cards (80 * 2/5 = 32).

That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48).  Half of those have the letter B, which is 24 cards (48 / 2 = 24).

Now we're down to 24 cards, and 5/8 of those have the letter C, meaning 15 cards have a C (24 * 5/8 = 15).

Finally, that leaves 9 cards with the letter D (24 - 15 = 9).


9 

"
"Okay, so Matthew takes 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of those, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes.  For the big holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, so that's 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.  

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.  To figure out how many hours that is, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour: 240 / 60 = 4 hours.


4 

"
"Okay, so they're ages add up to 20 now. In 10 years, each of them will be 10 years older.  That means their combined age will go up by 20 years (10 for each of them). So, 20 + 20 = 40.

40 

"
"Okay, so let's break this down.

Ruby is 6 times older than Sam right now.  That means if Sam is ""x"" years old, Ruby is 6x years old.

In 9 years, Ruby will be 6x + 9 years old, and Sam will be x + 9 years old.

The problem says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up an equation:

6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)

Let's solve for x:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27
3x = 18
x = 6

So Sam is currently 6 years old. 



"
"Okay, so Peter spent $5 on popsicles (20 x $0.25) and $2 on ice cream bars (4 x $0.50).  That means he spent a total of $7.


$7.00 

"
"Okay, so a cobra has 70 spots and that's twice the number a mamba has.  That means a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

There are 40 cobras with 70 spots each, so they have a total of 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

The 60 mambas have 35 spots each, for a total of 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

All together, that's 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.


2450
"
"Okay, so Maddy needs to feed 12 players + 3 coaches = 15 people.  Then there are 12 players * 2 guests/player = 24 guests. That's a total of 15 + 24 = 39 people.

Since each pizza feeds 3 people, she'll need 39 people / 3 people/pizza = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza is $15, then she'll spend 13 pizzas * $15/pizza = $195. 


$195
"
"Okay, so Katerina uses 8 topaz stones per necklace, and each one is 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  The whole necklace is 25 inches, so the silver beads take up 25 - 8 = 17 inches.  Each bead is 1/4 inch, so she uses 17 / 0.25 = 68 beads.


68 

"
"Okay, so they doubled the stories they wrote in the second week.  

* Alani wrote 20 stories the first week, so she wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories the second week.
* Braylen wrote 40 stories the first week, so he wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories the second week.
* Margot wrote 60 stories the first week, so she wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories the second week.

That means in the second week they wrote a total of 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories.

In the first week they wrote 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories.

 Altogether, they wrote 240 + 120 = 360 stories. 


360
"
"Okay, so Ann's brother is twice her age, which means he's 9 * 2 = 18 years old.  In three years, he'll be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. 

21 

"
"Okay, so Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, which is 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents.  That means she has a total of 125 + 20 = 145 cents.

If the pop costs 55 cents, she'll have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left. 


90 

"
"Okay, so there are 24 stars in the rows of 8 and 12 stars in the rows of 6. That's a total of 36 stars.  That means there are 40 stars left for the rows of 5 (76 total stars - 36 stars = 40 stars). Since each row of 5 has 5 stars, there must be 8 rows of 5 (40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows).


8 

"
"Okay, so they need to move 80 flagstones and each one weighs 75 pounds. That's a lot of weight!  

First, you gotta figure out how much all the flagstones weigh together: 80 flagstones * 75 pounds/flagstone = 6000 pounds.

Each truck can only carry 2000 pounds, so they'll need 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks. 


3 

"
"Okay, so the fast car is going 60 miles per hour and covers 480 miles.  That means the slow car is going 30 miles per hour (half the speed). To figure out how long it takes the slow car to go 480 miles, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours


16 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali, who has 22. So Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.

Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

The problem says they have 10 times *fewer* medals than the total given out.  That means the total number of medals is 39 x 10 = 390.


390 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 chocolate bars in total (8 packets x 5 bars per packet). The adults get 24 bars (4 adults x 6 bars each). That leaves 16 bars for the 8 children.  If they share equally, each child gets 2 bars (16 bars / 8 children). 


2 

"
"Okay, so Susan works for three hours, but she takes a 30-minute break. That means she actually works for 2.5 hours.  

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 2.5 * 60 = 150 minutes.

She makes $5 for every 10 minutes, so she earns 150 / 10 = 15 sets of $5.

That means she makes 15 * $5 = $75. 


$75 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Mike has 21 points. Jim has 3 less than Mike, so he has 18 points. Tony has twice as many points as Mike, meaning he has 42 points.

After the third round, they have a total of 21 + 18 + 42 = 81 points.

Now, Mike and Tony both get an extra point because they have over 20 points. So, they get 1 extra point each, for a total of 2 extra points.

That means they have a final total of 81 + 2 = 83 points. 


83
"
"Okay, so Will has 15 oranges. His oldest son washes 8 oranges because he's 8 years old. His youngest son is 4, so he washes 4 oranges.  That means they wash a total of 12 oranges.  

Will has 3 oranges left unwashed. 


3
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

On the first day, Darren does 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he does 100 + 20 = 120 pushups, 50 - 10 = 40 squats, and 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses. That's 120 + 40 + 40 = 200 exercises.

In total, over the two days, he does 170 + 200 = 370 exercises.


370 

"
"Okay, so they eat 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat twice a day, so that's 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 kg per person each day.

Since there are 5 people, they eat a total of 0.4 * 5 = 2 kg of rice every day.

A 42 kg bag will last them 42 / 2 = 21 days.

That's 21 / 7 = 3 weeks. 


3 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Sam wanted to sell 120 crates, but he was closed for two days.  He sold 20 crates on the weekend, then 15, 12, and 18 crates on the other days.  That's a total of 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

To see how far off he was, we subtract: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

So Sam was 55 crates short of his goal. 



"
"Okay, so Carmen starts at $200. Then three other people bid, and each time the price goes up by $50.  So that's $50 x 3 = $150 more.  

That means the desk ends up costing her $200 + $150 = $350.


$350 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

So John drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home, which is 60 miles a day. He does that 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week.  Over a year, that's 300 miles/week * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

His driving costs $2 per mile, so that's 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 for the year.

He also gives his driver a $150 bonus every month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's another $150/month * 12 months = $1,800.

Adding those together, his total cost for the year is $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.


$31,800
"
"Okay, so Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Sunday and Monday put together.  He did 23 minutes on Sunday and 16 on Monday, so that's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes total. To double that for Tuesday, he needs to exercise for 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"
"You only need one piece of paper to make a 32-page tabloid. You just fold it in half! 



"
"Okay, so Annika started with $50. She spent half of that on food, which is $25. Then she spent another $10 on rides.  That means she spent a total of $25 + $10 = $35.  If she started with $50 and spent $35, she has $15 left. 


$15
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Elise has 50 books left, and she sold 45 this year, so she sold 135 books in the first two years (135 = 50 + 45).  Since she sold twice as many in the first year compared to this year, she sold 90 books in the first year (45 * 2 = 90). That means she sold 45 books in the second year (90 - 45 = 45).

Since each book costs $20, she made $900 in the second year (45 * 20 = 900).


$900 

"
"Okay, so Watson works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is 50 hours a week. He makes $10 an hour, so that's 50 hours * $10/hour = $500 a week. Plus, he gets a $300 bonus every week, so that's $500 + $300 = $800 a week.

April has 4 weeks, so he made $800/week * 4 weeks = $3200 in April.


$3200 

"
"Okay, so John wins 80% of his matches, which means he loses 20%.  To find out how many people he lost to, we multiply the total number of people he arm wrestled by 20%: 20 people * 0.20 = 4 people.


4 

"
"Okay, so they make 60 loaves a day.  They sell 2/3 of them in the morning, which is 40 loaves (60 x 2/3 = 40). That leaves 20 loaves left (60 - 40 = 20).  Half of those are sold in the afternoon, so that's 10 loaves (20 / 2 = 10).


10 

"
"Okay, so Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds each week (8 / 4 = 2). Sandy wants to lose the same amount as Joey, but it takes her 4 weeks to lose what Joey loses in one.  So, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount. 


4 

"
"Okay, so the ice cream is $2 cheaper now, and you're buying two tubs, so that's $2 x 2 = $4 saved there.  Each packet of milk is 50 cents cheaper, and you're getting four, so that's $0.50 x 4 = $2 saved on milk.

In total, you'd save $4 + $2 = $6. 


$6
"
"Okay, so the serum gives an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days.  If someone drinks it, after 15 days they'd have 15 / 3 = 5 extra arms. And for legs, it would be 15 / 5 = 3 extra legs.  That means they'd have a total of 5 + 3 = 8 new limbs. 


8 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Theo spends $600 on suits (6 suits * $100/suit) and $150 on suitcases (3 suitcases * $50/suitcase). His flight ticket costs $1200 because it's $700 more than five times the price of a suit ($100 * 5 + $700).

That means he's already spent $1950 in total ($600 + $150 + $1200).

He wants to save $2000, and he started with $6000, so he has $4050 left ($6000 - $1950).

That leaves him with $2050 for gifts ($4050 - $2000). 



"
"Okay, so three people eat 3 eggs each, that's 3 * 3 = 9 eggs.  The other two people eat 2 eggs each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.

That means they eat a total of 9 + 4 = 13 eggs every day.

In a week, they'd eat 13 * 7 = 91 eggs. 


91 

"
"Okay, so Quinn is 30. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, making her 27. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so he's 32. 


32
"
"Okay, so Cera is 46 now, which means six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, so he was 20.

The problem says Chile's population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age, so that's 3000 * 20 = 60000 people.

But that was six years ago, and it says that was only half the population now. So, Chile's population now is 60000 * 2 = 120000 people. 


120000
"
"Okay, so there are 105 players total.  Let's say there are ""d"" players on defense.  That means there are 2d players on offense, and d/2 players on special teams.

If we add all those up, it should equal 105:  d + 2d + d/2 = 105

To make the math easier, let's multiply everything by 2: 2d + 4d + d = 210

Combining like terms, we get 7d = 210

Dividing both sides by 7, we find that d = 30.


So there are **30** players on defense. 

"
"Okay, so Martha invited a bunch of people. Let's see... 2 families with 6 people each is 12 people, and 3 families with 4 people each is 12 people too. That's 24 people in total. But then 8 people got sick and couldn't come, and 2 more had other plans.  So, 24 - 10 = 14 people showed up to the party.


14 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Solomon starts with 50 marbles and gets 20 more from Johanna, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.

His dad gives him 2/5 times the amount he got from Johanna, which is (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.

Now Solomon has 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.


156 

"
"Okay, so the pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find out how much water it holds, we need to multiply those numbers together: 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.

Since it costs $0.10 for every cubic foot of water, we multiply the total cubic feet by the price: 120 x $0.10 = $12.00


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so there are 30 boys.  There are three times as many girls, so there are 30 * 3 = 90 girls. There are 1/10 as many nongendered kids as boys, meaning there are 30 * (1/10) = 3 nongendered kids.

To find the total, we add them all up: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 children. 



"
"Okay, so they need 45 wires, and the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. That means for every 3 wires, there's 1 pole.  

If there are 45 wires, and each group of 3 wires needs 1 pole, then they need 45 / 3 = 15 poles.


15 

"
"Okay, so there were 25 guys and 15 girls at the party.  That's 40 people total. Then a quarter of them left, which is 10 people (40 / 4 = 10).

That means 30 people stayed (40 - 10 = 30). We know 22 guys stayed, so the rest must be girls: 30 - 22 = 8.


8 

"
"Okay, so the book costs $4, and the magazine is half that price, which is $2.  The pen is $1 cheaper than the magazine, so it costs $1. 


$1
"
"Okay, so Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 of them aren't in boxes. That means she has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in boxes.

Together, Jam and Meg have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

If each box holds, say, 8 pencils, they'd need 70 / 8 = 8.75 boxes.  Since you can't have part of a box, they'd need 9 boxes to fit all their pencils. 

9 

"
"Okay, so Shannon's coffee gets weaker in two ways: from the ice and from the cream.  

Each ice cube makes it 12 ml weaker, and she needs 65 degrees of cooling / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes. That's 5 cubes * 12 ml/cube = 60 ml weaker from the ice.

Then she adds 15 ml of cream, so in total, her coffee is 60 ml + 15 ml = 75 ml weaker.


75 

"
"Okay, so they got 7 new records, and you need 2 old records to get 1 new one.  That means they must have brought in 7 * 2 = 14 old records.


14 

"
"Okay, so there are 100 programmers in total.  We know 2/5 of them are junior programmers, which is 40 people (100 * 2/5 = 40). That means there are 60 senior programmers (100 - 40 = 60).

Junior programmers make $2000 each, so the company pays them $80,000 a month (40 * $2000 = $80,000).

Senior programmers make $400 more than juniors, so they make $2400 each ($2000 + $400 = $2400).  That means the company pays them $144,000 a month (60 * $2400 = $144,000).

To find the total, we add the junior and senior salaries: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.


So the company pays $224,000 to all the programmers each month. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

So, 20 people are on the bus before the third stop.  But 7 people got off at the second stop, meaning there were 20 + 7 = 27 people on the bus before then.

Then 8 people got on at the second stop, so there were 27 - 8 = 19 people on the bus after the first stop.

Finally, 5 people got on at the first stop, so there must have been 19 - 5 = 14 people on the bus at the beginning.


14 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2, leaving him with 22. Then he gives 14 to his friends, so he has 8 left. On his way home, he buys twice the amount he gave away, which is 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.  Now he has 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. He eats 3 that night (36 - 3 = 33) and 2 in the morning (33 - 2 = 31).

So the answer is 31. 

"
"Okay, so the phone is at 60% and needs to get to 100%. That means it needs another 40%.

It charges 1% every 3 minutes, so to get to 40% it'll take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 120 minutes is equal to 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

"
"Okay, so Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mom gives her 10 more, so she has 17 total. Then she gives 3 to Ella, leaving her with 14. 


14
"
"Okay, so they got $4 in rewards from spending $80 last time. Then the coupon saved them double that, which is $8.  So they saved a total of $4 + $8 = $12.  Since their stuff cost $43, they paid $43 - $12 = $31.


$31 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $15 * 2000 = $30,000 before taxes.  But then they take out 20% for taxes, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. So Job A leaves him with $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B is a bit trickier. It's a flat $42,000, but then there's that $6,000 property tax right off the bat. That leaves him with $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Then they take 10% for taxes on that, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. So Job B ends up being $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

That means Job B pays him $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more.


$8,400
"
"Okay, so 40% of the castles are ruins, which is 220 castles * 0.40 = 88 castles.  Half of those are unmanned, so that's 88 castles / 2 = 44 castles.


44 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Furniture United wants $1350 upfront and then $350 a month for 6 months. So that's $350 * 6 = $2100 for the monthly payments.  In total, that's $2100 + $1350 = $3450.

Cozy Homes wants $1100 upfront and then $250 a month for 9 months. So the monthly payments are $250 * 9 = $2250.  That makes the total cost $2250 + $1100 = $3350.

The difference between the two is $3450 - $3350 = $100.

So Furniture United is $100 more expensive. 



"
"Okay, so they have a total of 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 paintball guns.  If they split them evenly, each person would get 24 / 4 = 6 guns. 

6 

"
"Okay, so Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers, and he's making 8 batches, so that's 30 * 8 = 240 ounces of sugar for the suckers.  Then he needs 70 ounces for the fudge.  

In total, he needs 240 + 70 = 310 ounces of sugar. 


310 

"
"Okay, so Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, that's 8 * $8 = $64.

The first year the price goes up 50%, so that's half of $8, which is $4.  So now each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12.

The second year the price drops 25%, which is a quarter of $12, or $3. So each share is now worth $12 - $3 = $9.

Since she has 8 shares, they're worth a total of 8 * $9 = $72.


$72 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Thomas ate three times more than Luke's 2 hot dogs, so he ate 2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs.  John ate half of what Thomas ate, meaning he had 6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs.  That means John ate 3 - 2 = 1 more hot dog than Luke.


1 

"
"Okay, so there are 200 students total, and two of the groups are the same size.  Let's call that size ""x"". The third group is 10 smaller than the other two, so it has ""x - 10"" students.

To find out how many are in each group, we can add up the sizes of all three groups and set it equal to 200:

x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Combining the 'x's, we get:

3x - 10 = 200

Adding 10 to both sides:

3x = 210

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 70

So the two bigger groups each have 70 students. The smallest group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.


60 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 60 animals, and we know they're all chickens or cows.  He has twice as many chickens as cows.  To figure out the total number of legs, we need to figure out how many of each animal he has.

Let's say he has 'x' number of cows. Since he has twice as many chickens, he has '2x' chickens.

If we add the cows and chickens, we get the total number of animals: x + 2x = 60

Combining like terms, we have 3x = 60.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 20. So he has 20 cows.

Since he has twice as many chickens, he has 2 * 20 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so the cows have 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so the chickens have 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Adding those together, all the animals have a total of 80 + 80 = 160 legs. 



"
"Okay, so Josh starts with 3 balls. Each week he adds one more, so after four weeks he's juggling 6 balls. But then he drops 3! Two get caught, but one is lost.  That means he's left with 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls. 


5 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.  The beetle and toad weigh the same as the frog, so they're also 50 pounds each. The snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it's 30 pounds.

Adding up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.


210 

"
"Okay, so Laurel got 24 outfits at first. Then she got double that at her shower, which is 24 * 2 = 48 outfits.  Her mom gave her 15 more, so in total she has 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits. 

87 

"
"Okay, so Tyson runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 more, which is 1000 meters more (5000 / 5 = 1000).  So now he runs 6000 meters a day.

If June has 30 days, he runs 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180000 meters in June.


180000 

"
"Okay, so Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A, which is $4. That means Juice Box B is $9. Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A, making it $11.  If Juice Box C is $11 and Juice Box B is $9, then Juice Box C is $2 more expensive.


$2 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 tables with 4 legs each, that's 40 * 4 = 160 legs. Then there are 50 tables with 3 legs each, so that's 50 * 3 = 150 legs.  

To find the total, we add those together: 160 + 150 = 310 legs.


310 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Together, they eat 20 + 7 = 27 cookies.

Since there are 36 cookies in a bag, Jenny eats 36 - 27 = 9 cookies. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Davos got a 40% discount on each shirt, which means he saved $12 on each one ($30 x 0.40 = $12).  That means each shirt cost him $18 ($30 - $12 = $18). Since he bought two shirts, he paid $36 in total ($18 x 2 = $36).


$36 

"
"Okay, so they used to make $1000 a day selling tractors (10 tractors * $100 each). Now they make $1100 a day selling silos (5 silos * $220 each).  That's $100 more than before.

To figure out the percentage increase, I'd do  ($100 increase / $1000 original amount) * 100% = 10%.


10 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

So Madeline spends $25 a week on food, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 * 4 = $100 a month on food.

Then she spends $20 on treats and $100 on medicine each month.

To find the total monthly cost, we add those up: $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

Finally, to get the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost by 12: $220 * 12 = $2640.


2640 

"
"Okay, let's see... Peyton has a busy week! 

* Yoga is an hour.
* Cooking class is three times that, so 1 hour * 3 = 3 hours.
* Cheese tasting is a quick half hour.
* The museum is half the cooking class, so that's 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours.
* And errands take 2 hours.

Adding it all up: 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 hours


8 

"
"Okay, so April needs 30 pots for the daisies and double that for the roses, which is 30 * 2 = 60 pots.  That means she needs a total of 30 + 60 = 90 pots. Since she already has 100, she'll have 100 - 90 = 10 pots leftover. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Andrea started with $36. She spent $11 on a sweater and then gave her brother $4.  To figure out how much she saved, we need to add up what she spent and then subtract that from her starting amount.

$11 + $4 = $15

$36 - $15 = $21

Andrea saved $21. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

John boated for 6 hours and swam for half that time, so he swam for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

He watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, meaning he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

That's a total of 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours spent boating, swimming, and watching shows.

We know this 15 hours is 30% of his whole vacation.  To find the total vacation time, we can set up a proportion: 15 hours / 0.30 = x hours / 1.  Solving for x, we get x = 50 hours.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.


20
"
"Okay, so Annabelle needs $400 and already has $80.  That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

Let's see how much she earns.  At her first job, she makes $10 an hour for 20 hours, so that's $10 * 20 = $200. At her second job, she makes $5 an hour for 15 hours, so that's $5 * 15 = $75.

In total, she earns $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she has $275 + $80 = $355.

Finally, to find out how much more she needs, we subtract: $400 - $355 = $45.


$45 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest one, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.  

Together, the shortest and second tree are 6 + 11 = 17 feet tall.

The tallest tree is twice that height, meaning it's 17 * 2 = 34 feet tall.


34 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Dean starts with $28. The cars cost 6 * $2 = $12, and the bears cost 5 * $1 = $5.  So he spends a total of $12 + $5 = $17.

That leaves him with $28 - $17 = $11. Then his mom gives him another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21 left.


$21 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  Morgan needs to pay for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts for herself, plus all her friends.

* Mini-golf is $5 per person.
* Arcade tokens are $5 per person.
* Go-karts are $10 per ride, and she wants to ride twice, so that's $10 * 2 = $20 per person.

That means each friend will cost Morgan $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Morgan has $90 and it costs her $30 to do all the activities, leaving her with $90 - $30 = $60 for her friends.

She can invite $60 / $30 per friend = 2 friends. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Marisa gets $5 a day and spends $1 on lollipops. That means she saves $4 each day.  Over 5 days, she'd save $4 x 5 = $20. 


$20.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  

Billy spent $2.00 on gumballs because 40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00. That means he had $8.00 left after buying the candy because he started with $10.00.

Since he spent half his change on gumballs, he spent $4.00 on candy.

To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we divide the amount he spent on candy by the price per pound: $4.00 / $1.50/pound = 2.67 pounds.


2.67 

"
"Okay, so Carver is 45.  That's 5 years less than double his son's age.  To figure out the son's age, we can set up an equation:

Double the son's age minus 5 equals Carver's age.

Let's say the son's age is ""x"".  So:

2x - 5 = 45

Add 5 to both sides:

2x = 50

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 25

The son is 25 years old. 



"
"Okay, so the train goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 50 miles less than the total of those two distances.  That means the last leg is 175 miles (75 + 100) minus 50 miles, so it's 125 miles long.

That makes the whole trip 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.

Since it does that three times a day, it travels 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles every day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so it can go 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before needing service. 


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. A collie bed needs the average stuffing of a Rottweiler bed (8 pounds) and a chihuahua bed (2 pounds), so that's (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing.

He needs 8 pounds for the chihuahua beds (4 beds * 2 pounds/bed) and 15 pounds for the collie beds (3 beds * 5 pounds/bed).

In total, he needs 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing. 


23 

"
"Okay, so John drives 200 miles to his friend's house, but a detour adds 10 more miles, making it a 210-mile trip.  He drives that at 70 mph, so that takes him 210 / 70 = 3 hours.

Then he drives back home, which is 240 miles, going 80 mph. That part takes 240 / 80 = 3 hours.

So the whole trip took 3 + 3 = 6 hours. 


6
"
"Okay, so there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. That means there are 96 - 43 = 53 boys.  Since 4 boys were absent, there were 53 - 4 = 49 boys at school on Friday. 


49 

"
"Okay, so there are twice as many boys as girls, meaning there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys.  

To find the total, we add the number of boys and girls: 12 + 6 = 18 kids.


18 

"
"Okay, so Jane needs at least 42 points to pass. She already has 15 + 18 = 33 points.  That means she needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points on her last test. 


9
"
"Okay, so 3 people got kicked out for not wearing masks. Then, 4 times that many minus 5 got kicked out for shoplifting, so that's 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.  Three times the number of shoplifters got kicked out for fighting, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons. Since 50 people were kicked out in total,  50 - 31 = 19 people must have been kicked out for other reasons.


19 

"
"Okay, so Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara's 8 points.  That means Erin had 3 * 8 = 24 points before scoring more.  

So, she had 24 - 14 = 10 points before. 

10 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.

First, the picture frames cost $20 each, and there are 44 seniors, so that's 44 * $20 = $880.

Etching adds 20% to the cost of each frame, so that's $20 * 0.20 = $4 extra per frame.  That means etching all the frames will cost 44 * $4 = $176.

Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's 2 * $5 = $10.

A quarter of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.  Each cord costs $12, so the cords will cost 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, to get the total cost, we add everything up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198. 



"
"Okay, so the wallpaper costs $400, but if you make it yourself you save 20%.  That means you save $400 * 0.20 = $80.  So, making it yourself would cost $400 - $80 = $320.


$320 

"
"Okay, so they sold 14 pairs on Friday. Then on Saturday, they sold double that, which is 14 * 2 = 28 pairs.  On Sunday, they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 28 / 2 = 14 pairs. But then 6 people returned their shoes, so they actually sold 14 - 6 = 8 pairs on Sunday.

To find the total, we add up all the days: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs.


50 

"
"Okay, so Hallie dances for an hour on Tuesdays and two hours on Thursdays.  On Saturdays, she dances twice as long as Tuesday, which is another 2 hours.  Adding those all up, she dances for a total of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours a week. 


5 

"
"Okay, so they bought $400,000 worth of stuff, but 40% was bad.  That means 60% was good.  To find out how much the good stuff cost, you multiply the total by 60%:

$400,000 * 0.60 = $240,000 



"
"Okay, so Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them give 1 kg of milk each day, and the other half give 2 kg each day.  

That means 15 sheep give 1 kg each, for a total of 15 kg of milk. The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, for a total of 30 kg of milk.

Adding those together, Mary gets 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day. 


45 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Sherman starts with 12 rolls and gives 6 to her kids. That leaves her with 6 rolls.  She cuts each of those rolls into 8 pieces, so she has 6 * 8 = 48 pieces for the chickens. 


48 

"
"Okay, so half the class likes blue, which is 40 / 2 = 20 students.  That leaves 20 students who like other colors.  If a fourth of those like green, that's 20 / 4 = 5 students.  The rest must like yellow, so that's 20 - 5 = 15 students.


15 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Lucy made $56 on Monday selling apples for $4 each, so she sold $56 / $4 = 14 apples.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples, and on Wednesday, she picked double that amount, which is 12 * 2 = 24 apples.

In total, Lucy picked 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples over the three days. 


50
"
"Okay, so Lindsay washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 20 socks (10 * 2 = 20).  She also washed 15 individual socks. That's a total of 35 socks washed (20 + 15 = 35).

If she started with 50 socks and washed 35, she's missing 15 socks (50 - 35 = 15).


15 

"
"Okay, so Rachel starts with 23 cookies and gets 42 more, that's 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.  Then her brother eats 44, so she has 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left. 

21 

"
"Okay, so Karan borrowed money and has to pay it back with interest.  

First, we need to figure out how much interest she owes. It's 10% of the original amount for five months. That's like 10/12 of a year, so we do:

* Interest = $3650 * 0.10 * (5/12) = $152.08 (approximately)

Now, add that to the original amount:

* Total to pay back = $3650 + $152.08 = $3802.08

Finally, divide that by the number of months to see how much she pays each month:

* Monthly payment = $3802.08 / 5 = $760.42 (approximately)



So the answer is $760.42
"
"Okay, so Cho hiked for a longer time and at a faster speed.  Let's figure out how far each person hiked:

* Cho: 14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers
* Chloe: 9 kilometers/hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance: 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers.


67 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so she has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos. She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, meaning she has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

To find the total, we add up all the silver pesos: 50 + 100 = 150. Then we add up all the gold pesos: 80 + 120 = 200. Finally, we add the silver and gold totals: 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.


350 

"
"Okay, so Millie spends $18 on supplies, and that makes 36 cups of lemonade (3 pitchers x 12 cups). She sells each cup for a dollar, so she'll make $36 if she sells it all.  

But she has to take out the $18 she spent first. That means she makes a profit of $18.

Since she sells 4 cups an hour, and she has 36 cups, that's 9 hours of selling (36 cups / 4 cups/hour = 9 hours).

So, her profit per hour is $18 divided by 9 hours, which is $2 per hour. 


$2 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Ruther has 12.8 hectares left, which is 2/5 of his original land.  To figure out how much he started with, we can think of it like this: if 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares divided by 2, which is 6.4 hectares.  Since the whole land is 5/5, we multiply 6.4 hectares by 5 to get 32 hectares.


32 

"
"Okay, so there are 52 people in the choir, and half are girls, so that's 52 / 2 = 26 girls.  

Half of the girls can't make it, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 girls who can't perform.

That means 26 - 13 = 13 girls can sing.

Then the 3 teachers join in, so there are 13 + 3 = 16 people singing. 


16
"
"Okay, so to find Wilson's average math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests.  

That means 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Then we divide that by 5 because he took 5 tests: 400 / 5 = 80

His math grade is an 80. 



"
"Okay, so 6 erasers at $2 each would cost $12.  And 8 pencils at $3 each would be $24.  Adding those together, 6 erasers and 8 pencils would cost $36. 


36
"
"Okay, so James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. He delivers a third of that amount to Mr. Yu, which is 66 / 3 = 22 messages.  

To find the total, we add the messages for both teachers: 66 + 22 = 88 messages.


88 

"
"Okay, so David gets the bracelet for $30 and can ride all the rides. Dasha needs to buy 18 tickets (9 rides x 2 tickets per ride) which would cost her $36 (18 tickets x $2 per ticket).  That means David saves $6 ($36 - $30).


6 

"
"Okay, so Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap (6 + 4 + 2).  If she has 144 inches of ribbon, she can use 144 inches / 12 gifts = 12 inches of ribbon per bow. 


12 

"
"Okay, so Betty and Sam's popsicles are in a 5:6 ratio, meaning for every 5 Betty has, Sam has 6.  If they have 165 popsicles total, we need to figure out how many more Sam has than Betty.

First, let's find out how many popsicles each ""part"" of the ratio represents.  We add the ratio parts (5 + 6 = 11) and divide the total popsicles by that (165 popsicles / 11 = 15 popsicles per part).

Now we can see Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts * 15 popsicles/part = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.


15
"
"Okay, so Tim's cable is $60 a month.  Netflix is $10. Hulu and Disney+ are each $10, but he gets a deal for bundling them. That's 20% off, so the discount is $20 * 0.20 = $4.

So the bundle costs $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding Netflix, his total streaming cost is $16 + $10 = $26.

He saves $60 - $26 = $34 by switching!


$34 

"
"Okay, so Carol spends 4 hours writing, then half of that recording, which is 2 hours.  Editing takes her 90 minutes, which is the same as 1.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, I need to know what percentage 1.5 hours is out of her total time.  

Her total time is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours.

So, (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = 20%

"Okay, so Wendy wants to put a bunch of books on shelves.  She's got 6 rows of shelves and each row has 6 spots, so that's 6 times 6 which is 36 spots for books.  She wants to double that number and then add 20 more. So double 36 is 72, and then 72 plus 20 is 92.

She needs 92 books. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Erica starts with 20 cards and gets 2 boxes of 15 cards from her dad, so that's 20 + (2 * 15) = 50 cards. She gives away 24 to classmates and 5 to family, for a total of 24 + 5 = 29 cards.  That leaves her with 50 - 29 = 21 cards. Then she gets 17 more, bringing her total to 21 + 17 = 38 cards.


38 

"
"Okay, so Jenny starts with 12 slices. Bill gets a third, which is 4 slices (12 / 3 = 4). Mark gets a quarter, which is 3 slices (12 / 4 = 3).  That's 7 slices gone already (4 + 3 = 7).  If Jenny eats 2, that's 9 total gone (7 + 2 = 9).  That leaves 3 slices left over (12 - 9 = 3).


3 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs $300 for the bike and already has $50. That means he needs to save another $250.  If he makes $10 a day, it'll take him 25 days to save up enough. 


25
"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

First, she saw 1/3 the number of millipedes as spiders, so there were 90 spiders / 3 = 30 millipedes.

Then, she saw twice the number of stink bugs as millipedes minus 12, meaning there were (30 millipedes * 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

Finally, to find the total, we add up all the bugs: 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs.


168 

"
"Okay, so Erica is 30. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, making her 35. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so she's 42.  That means Alice is 12 years older than Erica. 


12
"
"Okay, so John drinks two glasses of milk, and each glass has 8 ounces. That's 2 * 8 = 16 ounces of milk total.  Since each ounce has 3 calories, he drinks 16 * 3 = 48 calories.


48 

"
"Okay, so he works 4 weeks a month, and that's 4 weeks * 6 days a week = 24 days a month.

There are 12 months in a year, so he works 24 days/month * 12 months = 288 days a year.

If he makes $50 a day, then he earns 288 days * $50/day = $14,400 a year.


$14,400 

"
"Okay, so Mark needs four times the normal amount of ingredients. That means he needs 3 cups * 4 = 12 cups of flour. Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he'll need 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

For milk, he needs 1 cup * 4 = 4 cups.  Milk comes in 2-cup bottles, so he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles.

He needs 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Mel's AC uses 900 watts every hour. If he runs it 8 hours a day, that's 900 * 8 = 7200 watts used per day.  

If he cuts back by 5 hours, he'll only use it for 3 hours a day. That's 900 * 3 = 2700 watts per day.

He saves 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts each day.  

To figure out how many kilowatt-hours that is, we divide by 1000: 4500 / 1000 = 4.5 kilowatt-hours saved each day.

Over 30 days, he'll save 4.5 * 30 = 135 kilowatt-hours.


135 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then there's a zebra with 36 stripes and another with half that, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

In total, all the zebras have 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.

Since there are 4 zebras, the average number of stripes per zebra is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes. 


22 

"
"Okay, so Tyson needs to feed 20 people and each sandwich feeds 4. That means he needs 5 sandwiches (20 / 4 = 5).

Each sandwich uses a pound of meat and a pound of cheese, so he'll need 5 pounds of each.

Meat costs $7 a pound, so that's $35 (5 * 7 = 35). Cheese is $3 a pound, so that's $15 (5 * 3 = 15).

In total, he'll spend $50 on meat and cheese ($35 + $15 = $50). 


$50.00
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Allan starts with 40 cannolis and twice that amount in corn, so he has 40 * 2 = 80 corns.

Then he buys 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

He buys 40 fewer corns than his new cannoli total, meaning he gets 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding that to his original corn, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, to find the total number of corns and cannolis, we add them up: 140 + 100 = 240.


240 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Elliott wants to get 10,000 steps. He does half on his way to and from school, so that's 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then he does another 1,000 with his friend.  That's a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

If he only has 2,000 left to go, he must have done 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps jogging.


2,000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The book has 45 pages and each page has 200 words, so that's 45 * 200 = 9000 words total.

Toby reads 300 words a minute, so it'll take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to finish the book.

He needs to be at the airport in an hour (60 minutes) and it takes 10 minutes to get there, so he needs to leave in 60 - 10 = 50 minutes.

Since reading takes him 30 minutes, he'll be ready to leave with 50 - 30 = 20 minutes to spare.


20 

"
"Okay, so they hired 40 people in May and paid them $15 an hour for a 40-hour week. That's $600 a week per person, and $2400 a month. So in May, they paid out $2400 times 40 people, which is $96,000.

In June, a quarter of the people left, so that's 40 divided by 4, which is 10 people. That leaves 30 people. They're still making $2400 a month, so the company paid $2400 times 30, which is $72,000.

To find the total, we add the May and June amounts: $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.


$168,000
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The taffy deal is a little tricky.  Two pounds would normally cost $6, but since the second pound is half off, it's $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

The magnets cost $0.25 each, and she got 4, so that's $1.00.

In total, she spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00

If she started with $10.00 and spent $7.00, she has $3.00 left. 


$3.00
"
"Okay, so Tim buys one pack of fireworks for $400 and another for double that, which is $800.  That's a total of $400 + $800 = $1200 before the discount.

He gets 20% off, so the discount is $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

That means the fireworks cost $1200 - $240 = $960 after the discount.

Don't forget the finale firework, which is $150.

So in total, he spent $960 + $150 = $1110. 


$1110
"
"Okay, so Shannon eats 2 cookies a night and wants enough for a whole month, which is 30 days. That means she needs 2 * 30 = 60 cookies.

Since each batch of her recipe makes a dozen, which is 12 cookies, she'll need to make 60 / 12 = 5 batches. 


5 

"
"Okay, so 1% of the candles will explode because they're 99% guaranteed not to. That's 500 candles (50000 * 0.01 = 500).  

Out of those 500, 5% will smell like wet dog, so that's 25 candles (500 * 0.05 = 25).


25 

"
"Okay, so each blouse is normally $20, but they're 30% off.  That means each one is $6 cheaper ($20 x 0.30 = $6).  So each blouse costs $14 on sale ($20 - $6 = $14).  Since she's buying 4, the total cost is $56 ($14 x 4 = $56).


$56 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Joanne gets 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gets double the tall tree apples, so she gets 30 * 2 = 60 apples.  She also gets three times the short tree apples, meaning she gets 15 * 3 = 45 apples.

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees.  That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.


350 

"
"Okay, so we've got camels and dromedaries hanging out.  We know they have a total of 180 heads, which means there are 180 animals in total.  

We also know there are 304 humps. Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one.  

Let's think about it this way: if all the animals were dromedaries, there would be 304 dromedaries. But since some are camels, there have to be fewer dromedaries.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I'm going to have to try a few things out.  Let me see... 

Aha! I think I got it! There are **56** dromedaries. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* Tom travels 200 kilometers a day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.
* Over the next two days, he travels 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
* He takes a break for one day, so no kilometers there.
* In the second week, he travels 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding all that up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.


3140 

"
"Okay, so Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and that's a quarter the size of Zack's.  That means Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.  Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, Timothy's locker must be 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches. 

40 

"
"Okay, so Stanley's comb fell from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet. That means Oliver needs to climb 3,000 feet to reach the comb. 


3000
"
"Okay, so Mr. Josue got $4000 from the first bank. The second bank gave him double that, which is $4000 * 2 = $8000.  

That means he got a total of $4000 + $8000 = $12000 from the banks.

Adding that to the money he already had, he has $5000 + $12000 = $17000 now.


$17000 

"
"Okay, so first, the boats took away 20 cats (4 boats * 5 cats each). That leaves 30 cats on the rock. Then, 3/5 of those cats ran off, which is 18 cats (30 cats * 3/5).  So, there are 12 cats left on the rock (30 cats - 18 cats).


12 

"
"Okay, so Bill gets a deal for the first 6 months, then the price goes up. Let's see...

* The first 6 months cost him 6 * $8 = $48.
* Then it's $12 a month for 8 months, so that's 8 * $12 = $96.
* Finally, it goes up to $14 a month for another 8 months, which is 8 * $14 = $112.

Adding those all up, it's $48 + $96 + $112 = $256 for two years. 



"
"Okay, so Cole got both jeans on sale. The tattered ones were $28, and the jogger jeans were $6 cheaper, so they were $22.  

He saved a total of $6, and we know he saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans. That means he saved $6 / 3 = $2 on the jogger jeans.

Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, they must have originally cost $22 + $2 = $24.

That means the jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $28 = -$4 less than the tattered jeans. 


 -4 

"
"Okay, so they have 4 big buses that each hold 60 people, that's 4 times 60, which is 240 people. Then there are 6 minibuses that hold 30 each, so that's 6 times 30, which is 180 people. And finally, there are 10 minivans that hold 15 people each, so that's 10 times 15, which is 150 people.

If you add all those up, 240 plus 180 plus 150, you get 570. 


570
"
"Okay, so Lillian has 3 homemade feeders that each attract 30 birds (20 + 10 extra). That's 3 * 30 = 90 birds.  Then she has 3 store-bought feeders that each attract 20 birds, for a total of 3 * 20 = 60 birds.  

Adding those together, she can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day. 


150 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. The bagel cost $4. The soup was 25% more than that, so it cost $4 + ($4 * 0.25) = $5. The cake was half the price of the bagel, meaning it cost $4 / 2 = $2.  

To find the total, we add up the prices: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

So Aleksandra's dinner cost $11. 

"
"Okay, so Kenny wants to buy a $100 amusement park ticket and has $50 left over after buying it. That means he made $50 from selling his cards.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards.  You can't sell parts of cards, so he sold 33 cards.

He kept 1/3 of his cards, and sold 2/3. If 33 cards represent 2/3 of his collection, then 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards is his total collection.  He can't have half a card, so he must have started with 50 cards. 


50 

"
"Okay, so the caterer planned for half the guests to have two hot dogs, which is 36 / 2 = 18 people. That means he made enough for 18 * 2 + 18 = 54 hot dogs.

But then 40 people showed up, and they all wanted seconds!  Since he only had enough for 54 / 2 = 27 people to have two hot dogs, that means 40 - 27 = 13 people didn't get a second hot dog. 


13
"
"Okay, so Indras' name has 6 letters.  Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half the number of letters in Indras' name.  Half of Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.  So her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.  Together, their names have 6 + 7 = 13 letters.


13 

"
"Okay, so Charlotte's pots and pans are $120, the bowls are $20, and the utensils are 5 times $5, which is $25.  That means everything costs $120 + $20 + $25 = $165 before the discount.

But wait, there's a 20% discount!  So we gotta do 20% of $165, which is $33.  

Finally, we subtract the discount from the original price: $165 - $33 = $132.


$132.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Dora wants to buy things that cost $6 + $11 + $2 = $19 in total. She has $2 + $16 = $18.  She needs $19 - $18 = $1 more.


$1 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Prince Thaddeus slayed 100 dragons. Prince Arthur got three-quarters of that, so he slayed 100 * (3/4) = 75 dragons.

Prince Walter used a rusty axe and slayed twice as many as Arthur, meaning he slayed 75 * 2 = 150 dragons.

Finally, Prince Bruce only slayed one-fifth as many as Walter, so he slayed 150 * (1/5) = 30 dragons.


30 

"
"Okay, so first you gotta figure out how much gas is in each container.  If you have 15 gallons and 5 containers, that means each container has 3 gallons (15 / 5 = 3).

Josey needs a quarter of a container, so that's 0.75 gallons (3 x 0.25 = 0.75).

Finally, there are 8 pints in a gallon, so Josey needs 6 pints of gas (0.75 x 8 = 6).


6 

"
"Okay, so George spent $5 and had 1% left over, which is 5 cents. That means he actually spent $4.95.  He bought 3 bags of chips, and those cost $1.20 (3 x $0.40).  That leaves $3.75 for candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought 5 candy bars ($3.75 / $0.75 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Ray starts with 25 lollipops and keeps 5 for himself. That means he has 20 left to share.  Since he has 4 friends, each friend gets 20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Rory starts with a 20-ounce cake and cuts it into 8 pieces.  She and her mom each eat one, leaving 6 pieces.  If the cake was cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces.  That means the remaining cake weighs 6 pieces * 2.5 ounces/piece = 15 ounces.


15 

"
"Okay, so Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.  They're sharing with 6 friends, so that's 8 people in total. If they split the oranges evenly, each person gets 56 oranges / 8 people = 7 oranges. 


7 

"
"Okay, so Antoine needs double the onions, which is 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds. Those onions will cost him 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.  The beef stock is $4.00.  That means all the ingredients cost $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.  Since the soup serves 6 people, each serving costs $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00. 


$2
"
"Okay, so Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's, and his takes 4 minutes. That means her drive is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes long.  She also wants to get there 5 minutes before him, so she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before Wayne.


21 

"
"Okay, so Billie's room is 360 square feet.  We know that's the length times the width.  He also said the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet.  

To find the width, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.


98 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (1 * 20 = 20 beads) and 2 packs of clear beads (2 * 20 = 40 beads), for a total of 60 beads.

Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (3 * 20 = 60 beads) and 4 packs of red beads (4 * 20 = 80 beads), giving her 140 beads.

Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.


80 

"
"Okay, so Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees. Baking for 3 hours with the oven raising the temp 5 degrees each hour means it gets 15 degrees hotter (3 x 5 = 15). So now it's 55 degrees.

Then the window is open for 30 minutes, which is like half an hour. It cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes, so in 30 minutes it cools down 6 degrees (2 x 3 = 6).

That means the final temperature is 49 degrees (55 - 6 = 49). 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes.

James is 10% faster swimming, so he takes 40 * 0.10 = 4 minutes less, meaning his swim is 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer biking than Jon, so his bike time is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 170 - 10 = 160 minutes total.

To find James's run time, we subtract his swim and bike times from his total time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.


So the answer is 39. 

"
"Okay, so Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is the same as 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes long.  Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning it's 80 minutes divided by 4. That gives us 20 minutes. 


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, we gotta see how far the horse runs. It goes 32 miles per hour for half an hour, so that's 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles.

For every mile, the horse eats half a bale of hay, so it eats 16 * 0.5 = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, so the hay will cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, which is 6 * $5 = $30.

If the hay costs $24 and he has $30, his change is $30 - $24 = $6. 



"
"Okay, so Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs, which is 4 times 12, or 48 eggs.  She also has 2 more eggs, so that's a total of 50 eggs.  Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50 divided by 5, which is 10 glasses. If each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 divided by 5, or 2 trays. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Joey starts with 214 points and gets 26 more, putting him at 240 points. Marcy starts with 225 and gets 10 more, for a total of 235 points.  To see how much Joey is winning by, we subtract Marcy's score from Joey's: 240 - 235 = 5.

Joey is winning by 5 points. 



"
"Okay, so the salesman spent $576 on the sneakers. He made $340 from the flash sale and then another $775 from the department store.  That means he made a total of $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find his profit, we subtract what he spent from what he made: $1115 - $576 = $539.


$539 

"
"Okay, so Beatrice has two types of crayon packs.  Six packs have 8 crayons each, so that's 6 * 8 = 48 crayons. The other four packs have 16 crayons each, so that's 4 * 16 = 64 crayons.  In total, she has 48 + 64 = 112 crayons.


112 

"
"Okay, so if the super ticket saves you $2, that means you would have spent $21 without it.  You know the movie ticket is $12 and the soda is $3, so subtract those from the $19 to see how much the popcorn costs.  That means the popcorn costs $4. 


$4
"
"Okay, so the price of helium balloons went up.  First, we need to figure out how much each balloon cost at the beginning. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each one cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by 170: $65 * 170 = $11050.


$11050
"
"Okay, so the car goes 60 miles per hour for two hours, that's 60 * 2 = 120 miles. Then it goes 30 miles per hour for one hour, so that's another 30 miles.  In total, it traveled 120 + 30 = 150 miles.

The whole trip took 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

To find the average speed, we do total distance divided by total time, which is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so Jenna starts with 8 sapphires and trades 3, leaving her with 5. Those are worth 5 * $800 = $4000.  She got 2 rubies in the trade, which are worth 2 * $1200 = $2400.  Adding those together, all her jewels are worth $4000 + $2400 = $6400.


$6400 

"
"Okay, so Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day, which means together they eat 8 apples a day.  If they keep that up for 30 days, they'll eat a total of 8 times 30, which is 240 apples. 

240 

"
"Okay, so Bob's got 10 raised beds, and each one is 2 feet by 8 feet by 2 feet.  That means each bed holds 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet of soil.

Since he has 10 beds, he needs 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet of soil total.

Each bag has 2 cubic feet of soil, so he'll need 320 / 2 = 160 bags.

If each bag costs $12, then the total cost will be 160 * $12 = $1920. 


$1920
"
"Okay, so there are 15 red cards.  There are 60% more green cards than red cards, so that's 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.  That means there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Yellow cards are the same number as red and green combined, so there are 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

In total, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards. 


78 

"
"Okay, so Katelyn saw 50 fairies. Then 25 more came, because that's half the number she saw.  That makes 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. But then 30 flew away, so there are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies left. 

45 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.  Out of those, 3 + 4 = 7 have spots.  

To find the percentage, we do (7 / 20) * 100% = 35%.


35% 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

The farmer has a lot of feed!  

* Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
* Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
* Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Adding it all up: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds of feed.

His truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he'll need 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips. 



"
"Okay, so Grayson gets 2 cents for each can and she drinks 3 a week, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 cents from cans.  She gets 3 cents for each bottle and drinks 5, so that's 5 * 3 = 15 cents from bottles.  That means she makes 6 + 15 = 21 cents each week. Over a month, which is 4 weeks, she makes 21 * 4 = 84 cents.


84 

"
"Okay, so Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, who has 10. That means Toni has 60/100 * 10 = 6 more plants than Frederick.  So Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 plants. 


9
"
"Okay, so Leila gave Ali half of her money, which is $100 / 2 = $50.  

Ali started with $21 and got $50 more, so now he has $21 + $50 = $71.


$71 

"
"Okay, so Ashley's pizza was $15.  To figure out a tip that's 1/5 of the cost, you divide the total by 5: $15 / 5 = $3.  

So her tip would be $3.  Then you add that to the original price: $15 + $3 = $18.

Ashley should give the delivery guy $18. 



"
"Okay, so Finley starts in first place. Then she falls back a bunch of spots, then moves up a little, then falls back again, and finally moves up one spot at the end.  

Let's see... she starts in first, then goes back 5 places, so she's in 6th. Then she moves up 2, putting her in 4th.  She falls back 3, so she's in 7th. Finally, she moves up one spot to finish in 6th place.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Miss Maria has a lot of cards! 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 in each, so that's 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

Then she has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each, so that's 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students.


30 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Becky spent 20 * $0.45 = $9.00 on apples, but then got a $1.00 discount, so she paid $8.00.

Kelly spent 20 * $0.50 = $10.00 on apples. She got a 10% discount, which is $10.00 * 0.10 = $1.00 off.  So she paid $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00.

That means Kelly paid $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00 more than Becky.


$1.00
"
"Okay, so each room has 2 sheets, plus a comforter, that's 3 things already. Then there are twice as many pillowcases as sheets, so that's 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillowcases.  And there are twice as many towels as pillowcases, so that's 4 pillowcases * 2 = 8 towels.

So in total, each room has 3 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.

If there are 80 rooms, that's 15 pieces/room * 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry in total. 


1200 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* He starts with 200 shoes.
* On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 5 * 2 = 10 more shoes.
* On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs, or 15 * 2 = 30 more shoes.
* On Friday, he gets 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 more shoes.
* So far, he has 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 200 shoes.
* But then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.
* That leaves him with 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.


120
"
"Okay, so Mary has enough sprinkles for 6 jars * 8 cupcakes/jar = 48 cupcakes.  Since each pan holds 12 cupcakes, she'll need 48 cupcakes / 12 cupcakes/pan = 4 pans. 

4 

"
"Okay, so Theo's pen cost $2. The paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen, so it cost (3 * $2) - $1 = $5.  

That means her total was $2 + $5 = $7. Since she paid with a $10 bill, her change is $10 - $7 = $3. 


$3
"
"Okay, so there were 30 students with 10 pencils each, that's 300 pencils to start. After two months, they used up 1/5 of them, which is 60 pencils.  That leaves 240 pencils. Then, at the end of the year, only 1/3 of those were left. So, 240 divided by 3 is 80 pencils.


80 

"
"Okay, so Matt wants 5 cookies. His dad's rule is kinda tricky: half the number of carrot sticks plus 2 extra cookies.  

To figure out how many carrot sticks he needs, we can think like this:

* If he eats 'x' carrot sticks, he gets x/2 cookies from that.
* He also gets 2 extra cookies, so that's x/2 + 2 cookies total.
* We know he wants 5 cookies, so x/2 + 2 = 5

Let's solve for x:

* Subtract 2 from both sides: x/2 = 3
* Multiply both sides by 2: x = 6


6 

"
"Okay, so the shark is 10 feet long, which is 120 inches. The two remoras together are 12 inches long.  To find the percentage, you divide the remoras' length by the shark's length and multiply by 100. So, (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%.


10 

"
"Okay, so if three-fourths of the students have a computer, that means one-fourth don't.  We know that one-fourth of the class is 20 students.  To find the total number of students, we can multiply 20 by 4. 

80 

"
"Okay, so Jason has 3 weeks to break in his shoes, which is 3 * 7 = 21 days.  He's walking 4 days a week, so that's 21 * 4 = 84 days total for walking. He needs to walk for 240 minutes, so he should walk 240 / 84 = 2.86 minutes each day. 


2.86 

"
"Okay, so Sarah spent $300 and each book cost $15. That means she bought $300 / $15 = 20 books.  Since she has 4 kids, each kid gets 20 books / 4 kids = 5 books. 


5 

"
"Okay, so there are 32 kids total.  9 are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both.  

To figure out how many aren't allergic to anything, we need to find the total number of kids with allergies and subtract that from the total number of kids.

So, 9 dairy allergies + 6 peanut allergies - 3 (since those are counted twice) = 12 kids with allergies.

Then, 32 total kids - 12 kids with allergies = 20 kids with no allergies.


20 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 groups of employees, and each group has 200 people. That's 3 * 200 = 600 employees total.  Then there are 7 tour guides for each group, so that's 3 * 7 = 21 tour guides.  

To find the total, we add the employees and tour guides: 600 + 21 = 621 people.


621 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The hotel is normally $1500 a night, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend.  So that's $1500 times 0.20 which is $300 extra per night.

That means the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per night.

For three nights, the hotel will cost $1800 x 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets are $5000 each, and there are two of them, so that's $5000 x 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane tickets, the whole trip costs $5400 + $10000 = $15400. 


$15400
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Jasper has half the blue paint Ben has, so he has 4 / 2 = 2 tubes of blue. He has three times the yellow paint Ben has, meaning he has 3 * 3 = 9 tubes of yellow.  In total, Jasper has 2 + 9 = 11 tubes of paint. 


11
"
"Okay, so the 2010 penny is 3/4 the weight of the 1959 penny, which weighs 48 grains.  That means the 2010 penny weighs (3/4) * 48 grains = 36 grains.

To find the total weight, we add the weight of both pennies: 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains.


84 

"
"Okay, so they need $200 total. Keegan made $83 and Tashay made $91, so together they have $83 + $91 = $174.  They need $200 - $174 = $26 more.


$26
"
"Okay, so Luri has three times as many songs as Gabriel, who has 20. That means Luri has 20 * 3 = 60 songs.

Gabriel's player can hold 100 songs, and he has 20, so he can add 100 - 20 = 80 more songs.

Luri can add 100 - 60 = 40 more songs.

That means Gabriel can add 80 - 40 = 40 more songs than Luri.


40 

"
"Okay, so Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges they picked, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 oranges.

Since he pays $10 for each orange he eats, he gave up 24 * $10 = $240.


$240 

"
"Okay, so Jillian's bag cost 3 times the price of her shoes minus $20.  Her shoes were $80, so 3 times that is $240. Then you take away $20, which gives you $220. 


$220 

"
"Okay, so James runs 12 miles a day, and he does that 5 days a week. That means he runs 12 * 5 = 60 miles every week.

Since he runs at 10 miles per hour, he runs for a total of 60 / 10 = 6 hours each week.


6 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and Uncle Ben feeds them twice a day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds per horse each day.

Since he has four horses, he needs 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

Over five days, that's 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Each bag has 50 pounds, so he'll need 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jana has 27 puppies and two-thirds of them are Pomeranians. That means she has 27 * (2/3) = 18 Pomeranians.  

Now, one-third of those Pomeranians are girls, so she has 18 * (1/3) = 6 girl Pomeranians. 


6
"
"Okay, so we need to find the average highest temperature.  That means adding up the highest temperatures from each place and then dividing by 3.

Southlandia: -48 degrees
Northlandia: 21 degrees
Midlandia: -3 degrees

Adding those together: -48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Then dividing by 3: -30 / 3 = -10


-10 

"
"Okay, so the toy car costs $12 and he already has $4. That means he needs $8 more. If he saves $2 each day, it will take him 4 days to save up enough money. 



"
"Okay, so Jaime can fit 24 eggs on each tray, and he has two trays, meaning he has a total of 24 * 2 = 48 egg spots.  Since he only has 64 eggs, he'll have 64 - 48 = 16 eggs leftover. 


16
"
"Okay, so the family-size pizza costs three times more than the small pizza, which is $8.  That means the family-size pizza is $8 * 3 = $24.  

In total, Sally spends $8 + $24 = $32 on both pizzas. 


$32
"
"Okay, so Heather's getting a pretty good deal on razors! 

Let's see... she's buying two packs, and each pack has four razors, so that's 2 packs * 4 razors/pack = 8 razors total.

The razors are normally $4 a pack, but with the buy one get one free deal, she's only paying for one pack, which is $4.00. Then she gets to take off another $2.00 with her coupon, so the razors end up costing her $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

That means each razor costs $2.00 / 8 razors = $0.25.  

To get the answer in cents, we multiply by 100, so each razor costs 25 cents. 


25
"
"Okay, so there are nine cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall, and one who is 60 inches.  That means the total height of all the cheerleaders is (9 * 64) + 60 = 636 inches.

To figure out how tall the pyramid is in feet, we need to divide the total height in inches by 12 (because there are 12 inches in a foot): 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.


53 

"
"Okay, so Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. Since she works 8 hours a day, that's 8 walks a day.  Over 5 days, that's 8 walks/day * 5 days = 40 walks.  

Each walk is 5 minutes long, so she walks a total of 40 walks * 5 minutes/walk = 200 minutes.


200 

"
"Okay, so Brett is 14 now, and in four years he'll be 18.  If Angela is three times Brett's age in four years, she'll be 18 * 3 = 54.  But that's in four years, so right now she's 54 - 4 = 50 years old.

50 

"
"Okay, so Paul drives twice a day for 14 days. That's 28 trips total.  Each morning trip costs $6 and each afternoon trip costs $2, so one round trip costs $6 + $2 = $8.

If he spends $8 per day on driving and does that for 14 days, he spends $8 * 14 = $112.


112 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Ashley brought 5 boxes of oranges with 10 in each, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more than that, so she had 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.  Together they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges. Since each pie needs 3 oranges, they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.


40 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out when the two party places cost the same.

The first place is $200 no matter what, plus $5 per person for food.  The second place is $25 per person, and that includes food.

Let's say 'x' is the number of people coming.  

For the first place, the cost would be $200 + $5x.

For the second place, it's just $25x.

We want to know when those two amounts are equal, so we can set them up like an equation:

$200 + $5x = $25x

Then we solve for x.  Subtract $5x from both sides:

$200 = $20x

Divide both sides by $20:

x = 10


So, if 10 people are coming, both places will cost the same. 

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.

We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi found a total of 43 insects. We also know some things about how many each person found:

* Lily found 7 more insects than David.
* David found half the number of insects that Bodhi found.

To figure out how many insects Lily found, we can use a little algebra. Let's say Bodhi found ""B"" insects, David found ""D"" insects, and Lily found ""L"" insects.

We can set up some equations based on the information given:

* L = D + 7 (Lily found 7 more than David)
* D = B / 2 (David found half of what Bodhi found)
* L + D + B = 43 (Together they found 43 insects)

Now we can use these equations to solve for L.  Since we want to find out how many insects Lily found, let's focus on the first equation. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get rid of ""D"":

L = (B/2) + 7

Now we can substitute both the first and second equations into the third equation to get rid of ""D"" and ""L"":

(B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Let's simplify and solve for ""B"":

2B + 7 = 43
2B = 36
B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can use the second equation to find out how many David found:

D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can use the first equation to find out how many Lily found:

L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



So, Lily found 16 insects. 

"
"Okay, so Mariah used a quarter of the yarn, which is 364 yards / 4 = 91 yards. Her grandma used half, so that's 364 yards / 2 = 182 yards.  

To find the total, we add those together: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards.


273 

"
"Okay, so Cherrie has 5 friends. Two of them want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts. The other three friends each want 2 gifts, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts.  

In total, that's 10 + 6 = 16 gifts. But then she buys 10 more random gifts, so she ends up with 16 + 10 = 26 gifts.


26 

"
"Okay, so the chair is 3 feet wide, and the rug is 5 feet wider than that, so the rug is 8 feet wide.  The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Twice the width of the rug is 16 feet, and 2 feet longer than that is 18 feet. 


18 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, and we know the grape and green apple gum cost a total of $3.  That means the strawberry gum cost $7 - $3 = $4. Since she bought two packs of strawberry, each pack cost $4 / 2 = $2. 


$2 

"
"Okay, so Frederick wants the most popsicle sticks for his money.  He can get more sticks per dollar from the 2x8 wood, since it gives him 400 sticks for $6, which is better than the 200 sticks for $4 with the 2x4.

He has $24, and each 2x8 costs $6, so he can buy 4 of them. That means he can make 4 * 400 = 1600 popsicle sticks.



"
"Okay, so Mario has 6 dogs and each dog needs 4 snowshoes. That means he needs a total of 6 * 4 = 24 snowshoes.  If each pair costs $12.00, then 24 snowshoes would cost 24 * $12.00 = $288.00. 


$288.00
"
"Okay, so Janet takes two bus rides a day, five days a week. That's 2 * 5 = 10 bus rides a week.

Each ride costs $2.20, so without a pass she'd spend 10 * $2.20 = $22.00 a week.

The bus pass is $20.00, so she'd save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00.


$2.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, which has 30. So the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows.

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, which has 20. That means the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.

The farm has a total of 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals.

The zoo has a total of 60 cows + 20 sheep = 80 animals.

Together, they have 40 + 80 = 120 animals.


120 

"
"Okay, so Rose bought 12 onions and that's four times more than Sophia.  That means Sophia bought 12 onions / 4 = 3 onions.  Rose also bought 4 potatoes, which is four times what Sophia bought, so Sophia bought 4 potatoes / 4 = 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 items. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by July. That's a lot!  He needs to burn 3500 calories for every pound, so that's 30 times 3500 which is 105,000 calories total.

Now, there are about 200 days until July.  To lose that much weight, he needs to burn 105,000 calories divided by 200 days, which equals 525 calories less than he eats every day.


525 

"
"Okay, so Gerald makes $30 each day at his job.  If he works a whole week, that's 7 days times $30, which is $210.  Then, if he spends $100, he has $210 - $100 left. That means he has $110 left.


$110 

"
"Okay, so Hannah runs 8 laps and each lap is 0.25 km, so she runs a total of 8 * 0.25 = 2 kilometers.  She needs 60 ml of water for every kilometer, so she'll need 2 * 60 = 120 ml of water.


120 

"
"Okay, so Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, which is like $100 (because 20% of 500 is the same as 0.20 times 500).  That leaves her with $400. Then she spends 25% of that $400 on CDs, which is another $100 (0.25 times 400).  So, she has $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the house and lot together cost $120,000, and the house is three times more expensive than the lot.  

To figure out the house price, think of it like this: if we split the total cost into four parts (one part for the lot and three parts for the house), each part would be worth $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.

Since the house is three parts, it cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.


$90,000 

"
"Okay, so Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags total.  She spent $4 on each pack, so the bags cost her 8 * $4 = $32.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.

To find her profit, we subtract the cost from the earnings: $320 - $32 = $288.


$288 

"
"Okay, so Joe throws a lot of punches!  He does 25 a minute, and each round is 3 minutes long.  There are 5 rounds, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 minutes of fighting.  If he throws 25 punches every minute, he throws 25 times 15 punches, which is 375 punches in total.


375 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made a quarter of that amount, so he made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies. Kelsie made twice as many cookies as Josh, meaning she made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies. 


18
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Ali has four $10 bills, so that's 4 * $10 = $40. He also has six $20 bills, which is 6 * $20 = $120.  

That means he has a total of $40 + $120 = $160.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives away $160 / 2 = $80.

That leaves him with $160 - $80 = $80.

He spends 3/5 of that on dinner, which is (3/5) * $80 = $48.

Finally, he has $80 - $48 = $32 left.


$32
"
"Okay, so Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, which is 120 minutes. Royce takes twice that long, so that's 120 * 2 = 240 minutes. But Royce takes an extra 40 minutes on top of that, so he takes 240 + 40 = 280 minutes. 


280
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  Each grandchild needs yarn for a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks.  

* A hat takes 2 skeins.
* A scarf takes 4 skeins.
* A sweater takes 12 skeins.
* Mittens take 1 skein.
* Socks take 2 skeins.

So, each grandchild needs 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins of yarn.

Since she has three grandchildren, she'll need 21 * 3 = 63 skeins in total.


63 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Chris did 12 problems on Monday and then 3 times that on Tuesday, so that's 12 * 3 = 36 problems.  

That means he did a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems in two days.

He started with 100 problems, so he had 100 - 48 = 52 left.

On Wednesday, he did a quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems to do on Thursday. 


39
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Tony picks 6 quarts an hour. Bobby picks one less, so he gets 5 quarts an hour. Kathy picks twice what Bobby does, which is 10 quarts an hour. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so he picks 8 quarts an hour.  

To find the total, we add up everyone's picking rate: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts per hour.


29 

"
"Okay, so they started with 200 loaves, sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon, for a total of 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold.  That means they had 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left. Then they got 6 loaves back from the store, so they ended up with 68 - 6 = 62 loaves.


62 

"
"Okay, so Jackson has 36 red tulips and can fit 6 in a row, so that's 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.  He has 24 blue tulips and can fit 8 in a row, meaning he'll have 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.  In total, he'll have 6 + 3 = 9 rows of flowers. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Heather has 27 cups of raisins and wants to split them evenly between cookies, granola, and snack mix. That means each recipe gets 27 / 3 = 9 cups of raisins.

Each batch of cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins.  To see how many batches she can make, we divide the raisins per recipe by the raisins per batch: 9 cups / (3/4 cup/batch) = 12 batches.


12 

"
"Okay, so Ada uses 12 kilowatts every hour, and that costs $1.50 per kilowatt.  So her daily bill is 12 times $1.50, which is $18.00.

If she adds the new thing, her usage goes up to 14 kilowatts a day. That's 14 times $1.50, which is $21.00.

The difference is $21.00 - $18.00 = $3.00 more each day.

Over a week, that's $3.00 times 7 days, so her bill will go up by $21.00.


$21.00 

"
"Okay, so if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  If you have five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so they'd paint 1/2 the house each day.  That means it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house. Since there are 24 hours in a day, it would take them 2 * 24 = 48 hours.


48 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 20 + 2 = 22 chairs.

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, meaning she has 22 * 3 = 66 chairs.

Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Together they have 20 + 64 = 84 sofas.

And they have a total of 22 + 66 = 88 chairs.

That means they have 84 + 88 = 172 sofas and chairs altogether. 



"
"Okay, so Tom spent $48 total and the CD cost $4. That means the headphones cost $48 - $4 = $44.  If he didn't buy the headphones, he could have bought $44 / $4 = 11 more CDs. 

11 

"
"Okay, so Josh worked out for 4 hours a week for most of the 8 weeks.  That's 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Then he did 5 hours for two weeks straight, so that's 5 hours/week * 2 weeks = 10 hours.

And one week he did 6 hours.

Adding it all up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours


40 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

So, they start with 48 people on the bus. Then 8 get off, and 5 times that amount, which is 40, get on. That means there are 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

At the next stop, 21 people get off, and 3 times fewer than the first stop get on, so that's 8 / 3 = 2.67. We can't have parts of people, so let's say 2 people get on.

That leaves us with 80 - 21 + 2 = 61 people on the bus.



"
"Okay, so Jame is gonna be 27 in 5 years, which means he's 22 now.  In 8 years, he'll be 30.  His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age then, so the cousin will be 55.  That means the cousin is 47 now.  

The difference between their ages is 47 - 22 = 25 years. 


25
"
"Okay, so Errol spent $1100 on the computer and $400 less on the printer, which means the printer cost $700.  Together, the computer and printer cost $1800.  That leaves $600 for the two monitors.  If we split that evenly, each monitor cost $300.


$300 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 kids, split evenly into 10 boys and 10 girls. The boys each found 60 seashells, for a total of 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

The girls found the same amount as the boys (600 shells) plus four times the amount the boys found (4 * 600 shells = 2400 shells).  That means the girls found a total of 600 + 2400 = 3000 shells.

Since there are 10 girls, each girl found 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells.


300 

"
"Okay, so George has 3 candies now, and he ate 5, meaning he started with 3 + 5 = 8 candies.  Nick had twice that amount, so Nick had 8 * 2 = 16 candies. 

16 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, who is 10. That means Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6 years old.  Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 6 + 2 = 8 years old. 


8 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The third book is 5 mm thinner than the second book, so it's 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.

The fourth book is double the thickness of the first book, making it 31 mm * 2 = 62 mm thick.

To find the total thickness, we add up the thickness of all four books: 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm.


188 

"
"Okay, so Emma wants to make 72 vlogs this month.  She's already made 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

That means she needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 more vlogs. 


18
"
"Okay, so the bill is $50, and they want to split it in half, so that's $25 each. But then she wants you to pay an extra 20% as a tip.  20% of $50 is $10. So you'd pay your $25 plus the $10 tip, which is $35.


$35 

"
"Okay, so this is how I'd figure it out:

First, each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.

The oldest guy then gets an extra $5, so he has $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day he gets another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.

Then he spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he triples that amount, so he ends up with $13 * 3 = $39.


$39
"
"Okay, so Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first half.  That means he needs to figure out how much to save in the first half, then double it for the second half.

Since April has 30 days, each half has 15 days.  He needs to save half his total goal in the first 15 days, which is $1125 / 2 = $562.50.

To hit his goal for the whole month, he needs to save $562.50 in the second half too.  So, he needs to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day in the second half of April.


$37.50 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

So Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, that's 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.

Then she got 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so that's 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

And lastly, 6 peaches at $0.75 each, which is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

To find the total cost, we add those up: $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

If she paid with $20, her change would be $20 - $13 = $7.00.


$7.00
"
"Okay, so Jairus makes $0.80 for each task and Jenny makes $0.50. They both do 20 tasks.  

Let's see... Jairus makes $0.80 x 20 = $16.00

Jenny makes $0.50 x 20 = $10.00

That means Jairus makes $16.00 - $10.00 = $6.00 more than Jenny.


$6.00 

"
"Okay, so Jeff gets four times as much as Brad.  That means if we think of Brad's money as 1 part, Jeff gets 4 parts. That's a total of 5 parts.

Since they split $100, each ""part"" is worth $100 / 5 = $20.

Jeff gets 4 parts, so he gets 4 * $20 = $80.


Answer: 80 

"
"Okay, so Jeff walks 3 miles to work and then 3 miles back home, which is a total of 6 miles each day. If he works 5 days a week, he walks 6 miles/day * 5 days/week = 30 miles. 


30 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Elise writes the alphabet twice, which is 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters. Then she writes half the alphabet, so that's 26 / 2 = 13 letters.  

So far, she's written 52 + 13 = 65 letters. But then she writes everything she's already written again, so that's another 65 letters.

In total, she wrote 65 + 65 = 130 letters. 


130 

"
"Okay, so Ali starts by calling 3 families. Then each of those families calls 3 more, and that keeps happening.  

So it's like:

* Round 1: 3 families
* Round 2: 3 * 3 = 9 families
* Round 3: 9 * 3 = 27 families
* Round 4: 27 * 3 = 81 families


81 

"
"Okay, so Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months, that's a total of 30 pounds lost.  If he weighed 70 pounds at the end, he must have started at 100 pounds. 


100 

"
"Okay, so James has 80 toys. Jonathan wants a playset five times bigger than that, which is 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  But he needs 2 more toys to get to that number, so he must have 400 - 2 = 398 toys right now. 

398 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* Notebooks cost $1.50 each, and he wants 5, so that's 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.
* Pens are $0.25 each, and he needs 2, so that's 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.
* The calculator is $12.
* The geometry set is $10.

So, before the discount, everything costs $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30.

The shop gives a 10% discount, which is $30 * 0.10 = $3 off.

That means Daniel pays $30 - $3 = $27 in total. 


$27
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Carly buys 5 hamburgers at $4 each, so that's 5 * $4 = $20.

She also gets 10 packs of fries at $0.30 each, which is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

And lastly, she gets 5 drinks at $2 each, totaling 5 * $2 = $10.

Adding it all up, her total is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

If she pays with a $50 bill, her change is $50 - $33 = $17.


$17
"
"Okay, so Antonella sold $2500 worth of stuff.  The first $1000 she sold earns her 30%, which is $300.  Then she has $1500 left over, and she gets 10% commission on that, which is $150.  So in total, she made $300 + $150 = $450.



"
"Okay, so Bill starts with 2 cases of water and each case has 24 bottles, that's 2 * 24 = 48 bottles.  He needs 2 bottles per guest and has 70 guests coming, so he needs 70 * 2 = 140 bottles total.  

He needs to buy 140 - 48 = 92 more bottles. 


92 

"
"Okay, so Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when it's cold.  When it's warm, it takes him twice that time plus 2 minutes, so that's (16 * 2) + 2 = 34 minutes per mile.

To swim 3 miles in cold water, it would take him 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

In warm water, it would take him 34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes.

That means he takes 102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles in warm water.


54 

"
"Okay, so John makes $2 an hour and works 5 hours a day, which is $10 a day.  He works 4 days a week, so that's $40 a week. To save $80, it will take him 2 weeks. 


2 

"
"Okay, so the fish sub costs $40. The cold-cut combo is three times that price, so it's $40 * 3 = $120.  

To find the total cost, we add the price of both subs: $40 + $120 = $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so there are 21 buttons total.  Some have two holes, and the rest have four.  Let's see... 21 minus 7 buttons with two holes leaves 14 buttons with four holes.  Those four-hole buttons have 14 times 4, which is 56 holes. The two-hole buttons have 7 times 2, which is 14 holes.  Adding those together, we get 56 plus 14, which equals 70 holes.


70 

"
"Okay, so Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's 24 cubic inch locker, meaning it's 24 / 2 = 12 cubic inches.  Peter's locker is a quarter the size of Zack's, so it's 12 / 4 = 3 cubic inches. 

3 

"
"Okay, so Octavia drinks half the recommended amount of coffee, and Juan drinks 10 times what she does.  If the recommended amount is 4 cups, Juan must be drinking 20 cups (10 * 2 = 20).  To get down to the recommended 4 cups, he needs to cut back by 16 cups (20 - 4 = 16).


16 

"
"Okay, so they have 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, that's 3 * 10 = 30 hamsters.  Then they have 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 guinea pigs.  In total, they have 30 + 15 = 45 rodents. 


45 

"
"Okay, so Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than him, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, meaning he weighs 260 pounds.

To find the average, we add up their weights: 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds. Then we divide that by 3 because there are three friends: 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.


180 

"
"Okay, so the sun starts at a 32-degree angle and goes up 5 degrees every hour for 10 hours.  That means it moves up a total of 50 degrees (5 x 10 = 50).

So, to find the final angle, you add the sun's movement to the starting angle: 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.


82 

"
"Okay, so James needs candles for his sons who are 12 and 8 years old. That's a total of 20 candles (12 + 8).  Since each pack has 5 candles, he'll need 4 packs (20 / 5).  If each pack costs $3, then he'll spend $12 in total (4 * $3).


$12 

"
"Okay, so Judy read for 15 minutes a night for a whole week, that's 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.

She reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes, so in the first week she read 105 / 1.5 = 70 pages.

That means in two weeks she read 70 + 100 = 170 pages.


170 

"
"Okay, so Cody and Trevor started with 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third, which is 12 / 3 = 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter, which is 12 / 4 = 3 sandwiches.  

Together they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. That means there are 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches left. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Shiloh is 44 now and in 7 years he'll be 51.  The problem says in 7 years he'll be three times as old as his nephew.  So, if we let the nephew's age now be ""x"", in 7 years the nephew will be x + 7.  

We know 51 is three times the nephew's age in 7 years, so:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Let's solve for x:

51 = 3x + 21
30 = 3x
x = 10

The nephew is 10 years old. 

"
"Okay, so the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5 for her first tooth. Then she got $1 for each of the next three teeth, so that's 3 * $1 = $3.  For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half of $1, which is $0.50 per tooth. So those two teeth were worth 2 * $0.50 = $1.

Adding it all up: $5 + $3 + $1 = $9.00 


$9.00
"
"Okay, so Richie scored 80 goals. We know he scored 20 more than Mark, meaning Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. Richie also scored 45 more than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.

To find the total, we add up all their goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 goals. 


175 

"
"Okay, so Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, meaning he made 21 * $4 = $84.  Liam only made $63.  That means Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more than Liam.


$21 

"
"Okay, so Peter has $70 and wants to spend it evenly over a week.  That's $70 / 7 days = $10 per day.

He spends the first four days buying wooden figures at $5 each, so he buys 4 days * $5/day = $20 worth of wooden figures.

That leaves him with $70 - $20 = $50 for the rest of the week.

He buys plastic figures for $2 each, so he can get $50 / $2/figure = 25 plastic figures.

He bought 4 wooden figures, so in total he has 25 + 4 = 29 action figures. 


29
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

The spaying cost $200.  The shots were $20 each, and she got 3, so that's $20 * 3 = $60.  The vases were $12 each, and 4 broke, so that's $12 * 4 = $48.

Adding it all up: $200 + $60 + $48 = $308.

So the kitten has cost Leah $308 so far. 



"
"Okay, so Ford grows 40 roses a week, but the shops want 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week.  That means he's short 65 - 40 = 25 roses each week.

Over a month, that adds up to 25 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 100 roses.

So the answer is 100. 



"
"Okay, so Katina starts with $3000. She takes out $100 each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so that's $100 * 12 = $1200 taken out each year.

Over two years, she takes out $1200 * 2 = $2400.

If she started with $3000 and takes out $2400, she'll have $3000 - $2400 = $600 left.


$600 

"
"Okay, so they spend $3 on bread that makes 10 sandwiches, so each sandwich costs $0.30 for bread. They also spend $30 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches, so that's another $3 per sandwich.  That means each sandwich costs them $3.30 to make.

They sell each sandwich for $7, so they make a profit of $3.70 per sandwich. If they sell 10 sandwiches, their total profit is $3.70 x 10 = $37.00.


$37.00 

"
"Okay, so Kate has a lot of crayons! Let's see... she has 3 boxes with 64 crayons each, so that's 3 * 64 = 192 crayons.

She makes crayon muffins with 8 crayons each, so she can make 192 / 8 = 24 muffins.

If she sells each muffin for $1.50, she'll make 24 * $1.50 = $36.00. 


$36.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, we need to find the size of the room: 18 feet times 12 feet equals 216 square feet.

Now, let's calculate the cost of each part:

* **Carpet:** 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592
* **Padding:** 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432
* **Removal:** 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864
* **Installation:** 216 square feet * $34/square foot = $7344

Finally, add up all the costs: $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 = $11232


$11232
"
"Okay, so Mack counted birds for a week. Let's see... he saw 50 on the first two days, then none on the third.  Days four and five he saw a bunch, 120 birds! Then 20 on day six and 90 on day seven.

To find the average, we add up all the birds and divide by the number of days: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.  

280 birds divided by 7 days is 40 birds per day.


40 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

So Diane starts with 20. Then she adds half of that number, which is 10, so now she has 30.  She divides that by 5, which gives her 6.  Then she takes the starting number, 20, and subtracts 12, leaving her with 8. Finally, she multiplies 6 by 8, which equals 48.


48 

"
"Okay, so the boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 3 less than that, which is 2 cards.  To find the total, we just add the number of cards each of them has: 5 + 2 = 7.


7 

"
"Okay, so Maggie's oven is running hot.  It's off by 18 degrees when she sets it to 450. That means it's 4% hotter than it should be.

To figure out what to set it to for 520 degrees, we gotta think about that 4%.  

If 4% of 520 is 20.8 degrees, she should set it 20.8 degrees lower.

So, she should set it to 499.2 degrees. 


499.2
"
"Okay, so Max has two movies to watch.  The first one is an hour and a half, which is 90 minutes. The second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes, so that's 120 minutes plus 5, which is 125 minutes.  

To find the total time, we add those together: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.


215 

"
"Okay, so Herb's house cost $76,000. Juan's house is 30% cheaper, so we need to figure out what 30% of $76,000 is.  That's $76,000 * 0.30 = $22,800.

Subtract that from Herb's house price to find out how much Juan's house cost: $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Finally, add the two prices together: $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

So the combined value of both houses is $129,200. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down. Judy brought 12 cups and twice that many dishes, so she brought 12 * 2 = 24 dishes. That's a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils for Judy.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, meaning she brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  That's 40 + 44 = 84 utensils for her friend.

Together, they brought 36 + 84 = 120 utensils.


120 

"
"Okay, so Pete gets 90 contacts in a box, and that lasts him 45 days. That means each box has enough for two contacts a day.  If he buys two boxes, that's 180 contacts total.  Each box is $100, but it's 10% off, so each box costs $90. Two boxes would cost him $180.  

So, 180 contacts for $180 means each pair costs $1.00. 


$1.00
"
"Okay, so Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 4 hours. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, meaning he worked 3 hours. That's a total of 7 hours for John.

Since they both get paid $10 an hour, Jill made $30 (3 hours * $10/hour) and John made $70 (7 hours * $10/hour).  

John earned $40 more than Jill. 


$40
"
"Okay, so Hannah burns 500 calories every hour doing aerobics, and she does that for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  Then she burns 600 calories running for an hour.  

That means she burns a total of 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, so she needs to drink 1600 / 200 = 800 ml of water.


800 

"
"Okay, so this problem is a bit tricky, but we can figure it out.  

Let's say there are 'x' blue jelly beans.  

* Red jelly beans are 1% less than blue, so there are 0.99x red jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, so there are 1.01x green jelly beans.

All together, that's x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500 jelly beans.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 3x = 4500.

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 1500 blue jelly beans.

That means there are 0.99 * 1500 = 1485 red jelly beans and 1.01 * 1500 = 1515 green jelly beans.

Finally, to find the difference between green and red jelly beans, we do 1515 - 1485 = 30.



There are **30** more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. 

"
"Okay, so Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM. If he goes up by another 5, he'll be at 57 WPM.  To find the average, you add those three speeds together (47 + 52 + 57 = 156) and then divide by 3 because there are three speeds. 156 divided by 3 is 52. 


52 

"
"Okay, so if Martin eats Cheerios he loses 1.25 pounds each week, and that's for 5 weeks, so he'd lose a total of 6.25 pounds (1.25 x 5 = 6.25).

But if he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds each week for 5 weeks, so he'd gain 8.75 pounds (1.75 x 5 = 8.75).

To find the difference, we subtract the weight he loses from the weight he gains: 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.


2.5 

"
"Okay, so Alex invited 100 people, and each of them brings 2 friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 friends.  That's a total of 300 people already. Then she invites 10 more friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, so that's 8 more people.  

In total, Alex needs 300 + 10 + 8 = 318 seats. 


318 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the 10-pound Affenpinscher, so it weighs 20 pounds. The Papillon weighs a quarter of the Dachshund's weight, meaning it weighs 5 pounds. Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times the Papillon's weight, so it weighs 220 pounds. 


220
"
"Okay, so the boots on Amazon cost $16 plus $4 shipping, which is $20 total. On eBay, they're $13 plus double the shipping, so that's $13 + ($4 x 2) = $21.  That means they're $21 - $20 = $1 more expensive on eBay.

"Okay, so the beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles in height each day.  Mark's window is 20 feet up.  

Let's see...

* Day 1: It's 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet tall.
* Day 2: It's 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet tall.
* Day 3: It's 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet tall.

So it takes **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than the window. 



"
"Okay, so John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day, and every 100 grams has 3 grams of protein.  That means he's getting 6 grams of protein each day (200 / 100 * 3 = 6).  

Over a whole week, that's 42 grams of protein (6 * 7 = 42).


42 

"
"Okay, so Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. That means if we subtract 5 from his current age, and then double it, we get his current age.  

To figure out how old he'll be in 3 years, we just need to add 3 to his current age. Since he's twice as old as he was 5 years ago, he must be 10 now (because 5 x 2 = 10).

So in 3 years, he'll be 13. 


13 

"
"Okay, so George needs two implants at $2000 each, so that's $4000 right there. Then he wants a fancy porcelain crown for one of them, which adds another $500.  That brings the total to $4500.  He already paid $600, so he still owes $3900. If he makes $15 an hour, he'll need to work $3900 / $15 = 260 hours. 


260 

"
"Okay, so we know all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's call the smallest angle ""x"".  

The problem says one angle is twice the smallest, so that's 2x. The other angle is three times the smallest, which is 3x.

To find out what x is, we add them all together: x + 2x + 3x = 180

That means 6x = 180.  If we divide both sides by 6, we get x = 30.

The biggest angle is 3x, so it's 3 * 30 = 90 degrees. 


90
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how much money Colby has.  

* He has 8 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents, so that's 8 * $0.25 = $2.00
* He has 6 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents, so that's 6 * $0.10 = $0.60
* He has 14 nickels, and each nickel is worth 5 cents, so that's 14 * $0.05 = $0.70
* He has 15 pennies, and each penny is worth 1 cent, so that's 15 * $0.01 = $0.15

Now, let's add up all his money: $2.00 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

Since each gumball costs a nickel (5 cents), we can see how many he can buy by dividing his total money by the cost of each gumball: $3.45 / $0.05 = 69 gumballs.


69 

"
"Okay, let's see... dogs have 4 legs, cats have 4 legs, and birds have 2.  

So, the dogs have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.

The cats have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.

And the birds have 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Adding those up, there are 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs in total. 


48
"
"Okay, so Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases it by 50%, which is like adding half of 8, so that's 4 more pounds. That makes it 12 pounds. But then he finds that's too heavy, so he goes down 2 pounds.  12 minus 2 is 10. 

10 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* **Year 1:** He starts with 5 games, buys 1 a month for 12 months (12 games), and gets 5 more for Christmas. That's 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.
* **Year 2:** He starts with 22 games, buys 2 a month for 12 months (24 games), and gets 5 more for Christmas. That's 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.
* **Year 3:** He starts with 51 games, buys 4 a month for 12 months (48 games), and gets 5 more for Christmas. That's 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.


So Steve has 104 games after 3 years. 

"
"Okay, so the plane goes 1200 miles in 3 hours, which means it's flying at 400 miles per hour (1200 / 3 = 400).  To go another 2000 miles at that speed, it would take 5 hours (2000 / 400 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours. That means he makes 120 / 2 = 60 pounds per hour. Marissa makes 3/4 of what Ruiz makes in an hour, so she makes (3/4) * 60 = 45 pounds per hour.

Together they make 60 + 45 = 105 pounds per hour.  If they work for 12 hours, they'll make 105 * 12 = 1260 pounds of chocolate.


1260 

"
"Okay, so Howard starts with $100. On Monday he spends $8, then on Tuesday he spends double that, which is $16. On Wednesday he spends four times what he spent on Tuesday, so that's $16 * 4 = $64.  

In total, he spends $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

If he started with $100 and spent $88, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.


$12
"
"Okay, so Patrick sold lemonade for a total of 6 hours.  For the first 4 hours, he sold 15 cups each hour at 50 cents a cup. That's 15 * 0.50 * 4 = $30.00.

Then for the last 2 hours, he sold 10 cups each hour at 60 cents a cup. So that's 10 * 0.60 * 2 = $12.00.

Adding those together, he made $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00 selling lemonade.


$42.00
"
"Okay, so the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles.  If Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that means his tires rotate 145,000 times each month (400 miles * 725 rotations / 2 miles).

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing to be replaced. So, we divide the total rotations the tire can handle by the rotations per month: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

That's 6 years (72 months / 12 months/year). 

6 

"
"Okay, so the big shampoo bottle costs $24 and lasts for 120 washes if you use 2 pumps each time.  If Jackie only uses 1 pump, the bottle will last twice as long, meaning she gets 120 washes * 2 = 240 washes.

That means each wash costs $24 / 240 washes = $0.10.  Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 10 cents. 


10
"
"Okay, so Joe has $50 and wants to buy a shirt for $25 and shorts for $35.  There's a 30% off sale, which is pretty sweet!

First, we gotta figure out how much the discount is for each item.  

* Shirt discount: $25 * 0.30 = $7.50
* Shorts discount: $35 * 0.30 = $10.50

Now, let's see how much each item costs after the discount:

* Shirt price: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50
* Shorts price: $35 - $10.50 = $24.50

Alright, time to add those up to see the total cost:

* Total cost: $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00

Finally, we subtract the total cost from Joe's starting money to see how much he has left:

* Money left: $50 - $42.00 = $8.00


Joe will have $8.00 left. 

"
"Okay, so Juan needs 1/4 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He's making 4 dozen a day, so that's 4 * (1/4) = 1 pound of butter per day.  

Since there are 7 days in a week, he'll need 1 * 7 = 7 pounds of butter for the whole week. 


7 

"
"Okay, so repaving Monica's street costs $194 per meter and it's 150 meters long. That means it costs $194 * 150 = $29100 to repave her street.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so repaving it would cost $194 * 490 = $95060.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street: $95060 - $29100 = $65960.


$65960 

"
"Okay, so John starts with $100,000 for 5 months, which is $500,000 total.  Then it takes him 10 times longer, so that's 50 months total.  He needs 50% more money each month after the first 5 months, so that's an extra $50,000 per month.  That means each month after the first 5 costs $150,000.

So, the extra part costs $150,000 per month times 45 months, which is $6,750,000.

Adding that to the first $500,000, the whole thing costs $7,250,000. 


$7,250,000
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The first player ate 6 ounces of steak.
* The second player ate 8 ounces of beef tips (8 tips x 1 ounce per tip).
* The third player ate a whole pound of steak, which is 16 ounces.

Adding those up, the team ate a total of 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat. 


30
"
"Okay, so there are 1000 people in the group and they each post 3 times a day. That means there are 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts every day.  March has 31 days, so in total there would be 3000 * 31 = 93000 posts. 


93000 

"
"Okay, so Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons of water. That's 2 * 20 = 40 gallons of water per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he uses 40 * 52 = 2080 gallons of water a year.

Water costs $0.15 per gallon, so he spends 2080 * 0.15 = $312 on water for laundry each year. 


$312
"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Scarlett spent. 

The aquarium was $10.00. The rocks cost $2.50 per bag, and she bought two, so that's $2.50 x 2 = $5.00. The coral was $2.00 each, and she got three, so that's $2.00 x 3 = $6.00. The fish were $0.50 each, and she bought 20, so that's $0.50 x 20 = $10.00. And the fish food was $2.00.

Adding it all up: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00


$33.00
"
"Okay, so the beanstalk starts at 3 inches. Then it doubles in size, so after week two it's 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.  Finally, it grows another 4 inches, bringing the total height to 6 + 4 = 10 inches. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour, and he works for 10 hours a day. That means he sells 15 * 10 = 150 kg of meat each day.

The bull weighs 750 kg, so it will take him 750 / 150 = 5 days to sell all the meat. 


5 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 rows of seats with 18 seats in each row, meaning there are a total of 4 * 18 = 72 seats.

The administrators took up 1/4 of the seats, which is 72 * (1/4) = 18 seats.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Parents filled 1/3 of the remaining seats, so they took up 54 * (1/3) = 18 seats.

Finally, the students took up the rest, which is 54 - 18 = 36 seats.


So there were **36** students in the auditorium. 

"
"Okay, so there are 6 poles at each intersection, and each pole has 4 street lights. That means there are 6 * 4 = 24 street lights at each intersection.

Since there are 4 intersections, there are a total of 24 * 4 = 96 street lights.

But, 20 of them aren't working, so there are 96 - 20 = 76 street lights working. 


76 

"
"Okay, so each DVD can be played 1000 times.  One DVD has already been played a bunch, 356 times. That means it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times. The other DVD has only been played 135 times, so it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times.

To find the total, we add those together: 644 + 865 = 1509.


1509 

"
"Okay, so John went to physical therapy twice a week for 6 weeks. Each session was 2 hours long, so that's 2 sessions * 2 hours/session = 4 hours of therapy each week.

Over 6 weeks, that's 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours total.

Since each hour costs $125, the total cost is 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000. 


$3000
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Jim chews gum for every two hours he's at school, and school is 8 hours long, so he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces at school.  

Then he chews one more on the way home and one after dinner, for a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces chewed.

He started with 20, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 left.

Finally, he gives half to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

That means Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left at the end of the day. 


7
"
"Okay, so Charmaine will be 16 in 12 years. That means she's currently 16 - 12 = 4 years old.  

In 4 years, she'll be 4 + 4 = 8 years old. 

8 

"
"Okay, so the baseball coach spent 9 * $3 = $27 on baseballs. The basketball coach spent 8 * $14 = $112 on basketballs.  That means the basketball coach spent $112 - $27 = $85 more than the baseball coach.


$85 

"
"Okay, so Arianna has 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row, that's 10 * 20 = 200 flowers total.  But only 4 out of every 5 flowers bloomed, so that's 200 * (4/5) = 160 flowers.


160 

"
"Okay, so Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb per second.  To figure out how many Mb per hour that is, we gotta do some conversions.

First, there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb, so her speed is 20/1000 = 0.02 Mb per second.

Then, there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

So, her speed in Mb per hour is 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour. 


72 

"
"Okay, so the tow truck towed 10 cars each day for the first three days, which is 10 * 3 = 30 cars.

Then for the rest of the week, it towed 4 fewer cars each day, so that's 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already towed for 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 days.

So for those last 4 days, it towed 6 * 4 = 24 cars.

In total, it towed 30 + 24 = 54 cars that week. 


54
"
"Okay, so Adam needs to be 4 feet tall.  He's currently 40 inches tall, which is 3 feet and 4 inches.  That means he needs to grow another 12 inches to reach 4 feet. Since he grows 2 inches every year, it will take him 6 years to grow tall enough. 


6 

"
"Okay, so James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each, so that's 10 * $25,000 = $250,000 total.

The company paid 30% of that to get the cars, which is $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

That means they made a profit of $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets 10% of that profit, so he made $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.


$17,500
"
"Okay, so 25% of the 100 surfers can stay up on the wave, which is 25 surfers.  Then 60% of those 25 are women, so that's 15 women.  That means 10 surfers who stayed up are men. 


10 

"
"Okay, so the gold jewelry costs 4/5 of what the diamond jewelry costs, which is $2000.  That means the gold one is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

The silver jewelry is $400 cheaper than the gold one, so it's $1600 - $400 = $1200.

To find the total price, we add up the cost of all three: $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.



"
"Okay, let's break this down. Max got 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that's 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.  He got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, meaning he got 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.

To find the total, we add up all the stamps: 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.


45 

"
"Okay, so Tom needs to close a 75-mile gap. He's driving 15 miles per hour faster than Bob.  

To figure out how long it takes, we can do 75 miles divided by 15 miles per hour, which equals 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.  Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than that, so Darren caught 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more than Darren, meaning he caught 14 fish. 


14 

"
"Okay, so Manny's parents will only pay if each class costs $10 or less.  Since the classes cost $60 total, they have $40 extra they're willing to spend. That means Manny can miss 4 classes before it goes over their limit. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jewel does 50 customers a day. Julie is twice as fast, so she does 50 * 2 = 100 customers a day.  Together they do 50 + 100 = 150 customers each day.  In a week, that's 150 * 7 = 1050 customers.


1050 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Paisley ran 4 miles, and Reggie ran 5 times that amount, which is 20 miles.  The problem says Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.  So, Lynn must have run 20 miles - 3 miles = 17 miles.


17 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how much Clyde spends on apples and oranges. 

First, let's see how much one apple costs. If four apples are $5.20, then one apple is $5.20 divided by 4, which is $1.30.

One orange costs $3.30 divided by 3, which is $1.10.

Five apples would cost $1.30 times 5, which is $6.50.

Five oranges would cost $1.10 times 5, which is $5.50.

Finally, add the cost of the apples and oranges: $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00


$12.00
"
"Okay, so the hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  That means it's 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet of dirt.

If he digs one cubic foot every 3 seconds, it'll take him 72 * 3 = 216 seconds to dig the whole hole. 


216 

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Bill's truck is going to cost.

The truck itself is $30,000.  The king cab is an extra $7500. The leather seats are $7500 divided by 3, which is $2500. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they're $2000. The light package is $1500.

So, all the extras together cost $7500 + $2500 + $2000 + $1500 = $13500.

Adding that to the price of the truck, Bill's total cost is $30000 + $13500 = $43500.


$43500 

"
"Okay, so Tim's getting a sweet deal!  

First, his raise is 5% of his old salary, which is $20,000.  That means his raise is $1000 (because 5% is like 0.05, and 0.05 times $20,000 is $1000).

So now he makes $21,000 a month. Plus, he gets a bonus equal to half his old salary, which is $10,000.

That means each month he's making $31,000! Over a whole year, that's $31,000 times 12 months, which is $372,000.

$372000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* The dress pants cost $750 divided by 5, which is $150 each.
* The suits cost a total of 10 suits times $750 per suit, so that's $7500.
* The dress pants cost 10 pants times $150 per pant, which is $1500.
* He bought 10 suits times 3 shirts per suit, meaning he got 30 dress shirts.
* Those shirts cost 30 shirts times $60 per shirt, totaling $1800.
* To find the total cost, we add up the cost of everything: $7500 + $1500 + $1800 = $10800.


$10800
"
"Okay, so they publish 20 articles a day together, and February has 28 days.  That means they publish 20 * 28 = 560 articles in February.


560 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Steve's wife is 64 because she's 4 years older than him. Their son is 32 because he's half his mom's age.  His wife is 3 years younger than him, so she's 29. 


29 

"
"Okay, so each bag has 8 portions of flour, and each portion is 2 kilograms. That means one bag has 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms of flour.  If we have three bags, that's 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms in total. 


48 

"
"Okay, so Alisa biked for 4.5 hours at 12 miles per hour, so she biked 4.5 * 12 = 54 miles. Stanley biked for 2.5 hours at 10 miles per hour, meaning he biked 2.5 * 10 = 25 miles.  

To find the total distance, we add Alisa's distance and Stanley's distance: 54 + 25 = 79 miles.


79 

"
"Okay, so Bill digs through soil way faster than clay.  Let's see... he digs 4 feet of soil every hour.  That means the 24 feet of soil will take him 24 / 4 = 6 hours.

Now for the clay. He only digs half as fast in clay, so he'll dig 4 / 2 = 2 feet of clay per hour.  That means the 8 feet of clay will take him 8 / 2 = 4 hours.

In total, it'll take him 6 + 4 = 10 hours to dig the whole well. 


10
"
"Okay, so Howie needs to get two cupcakes for each person in his class, plus himself and his teacher.  That's 25 classmates + 1 (Howie) + 1 (teacher) = 27 people.

Since everyone gets two cupcakes, he needs 27 * 2 = 54 cupcakes. 


54
"
"Okay, so Fishio started with 2000 likes. After three weeks, that number went up 70 times, which is 2000 * 70 = 140000 likes. Then she got 20000 more new likes, so in total she has 140000 + 20000 = 160000 likes. 

160000 

"
"Okay, so Clara got a deal on Tuesday! She saved $2 on 20 pomegranates, which normally cost $20 each. That means she paid $398 in total.

The next day, the price went up to $30 per pomegranate, but there was a 10% discount. So, 20 pomegranates would have cost $600, but with the discount, Sheila paid $540.

The difference between the two prices is $540 - $398 = $142.


Answer: 142 

"
"Okay, so Ariadne made $400 from red hats, and that was only half of what she made from green hats.  That means she made $400 * 2 = $800 from green hats.

So in the first month, she made a total of $400 + $800 = $1200.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of what she made in the first month, which is $1200 * (3/4) = $900.

Over both months, she made $1200 + $900 = $2100.


2100 

"
"Okay, so James gets a free hour, which means he actually pays for 3 hours. The first hour is $15, and then each hour after that doubles in price.  So the second hour is $30 and the third hour is also $30.  

Let me add that up: $15 + $30 + $30 = $75


$75
"
"Okay, so Sally started with $200 and now has $420. That means she got $420 - $200 = $220 this week.  But she should have gotten $300.  So they took out $300 - $220 = $80 from her paycheck.


$80 

"
"Okay, so Lori needs enough deviled eggs for 16 guests, and each guest wants 3 halves. That's 16 * 3 = 48 deviled egg halves.

Since each whole egg makes 2 halves, she'll need 48 / 2 = 24 eggs.

A dozen has 12 eggs, so she needs 24 / 12 = 2 dozen eggs. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Shiela needs to write 15 pages total. She's already done a third of it, which is 5 pages (15 / 3 = 5).  That means she has 10 pages left to write (15 - 5 = 10).


10 

"
"Okay, so Mike has to read 200 pages in 30 days, and he wants to read 10 pages each day.  That means it will take him 20 days to finish the book (200 pages / 10 pages/day = 20 days).  

If he finishes in 20 days, he'll be done 10 days before the deadline (30 days - 20 days = 10 days).


10

"Okay, so the plane cost $150,000 to buy. Then he spends $5000 a month on the hanger and double that on fuel, which is $10,000. That's $15,000 a month total. Over a year, that's $15,000 times 12 months, which is $180,000.  

So, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 (buying the plane) + $180,000 (hanger and fuel) = $330,000.


$330000 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Rice took 30 minutes. Pork took 20 minutes longer than that, so pork took 50 minutes.  

Together, rice and pork took 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Beans took half that time, so beans took 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

To find the total cooking time, we add up the time for each food: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.


120 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how much more the first mix costs compared to the second.

The first mix has half a pound of almonds, which would cost $5 (since almonds are $10 a pound). It also has a third of a pound of walnuts, costing $5 (because walnuts are $15 a pound). So the first mix is $10 total.

The second mix has a fifth of a pound of almonds, which is $2, and the same amount of walnuts as the first mix, costing $5. That makes the second mix $7.

The difference in price is $10 - $7 = $3.

"
"Okay, so Lee has sheep and geese, and we know they have a total of 70 legs and 20 heads.  Sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2, right?

Let's think about it... if all 20 animals were sheep, they'd have 80 legs (20 x 4 = 80). That's too many legs!  So, some of them must be geese.

Hmm, this is tricky.  Maybe we can try guessing and checking?  Let's say there are 10 sheep. That's 40 legs (10 x 4 = 40). That leaves 30 legs for the geese (70 - 40 = 30).  

But wait, 30 legs means there would be 15 geese (30 / 2 = 15).  That's a total of 25 animals (10 + 15 = 25), not 20!

Let's try fewer sheep. How about 15 sheep? That's 60 legs (15 x 4 = 60). That leaves 10 legs for the geese (70 - 60 = 10).  

That means there would be 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).  

Yep, that adds up to 20 animals (15 + 5 = 20)!


So the answer is 15. 

"
"Okay, so Roger's usual coffee is $5 a pound, but he has to get the more expensive stuff which is 20% more.  That means the fancy coffee is $5 + ($5 x 0.20) = $6 a pound.

He drinks a pound a day, so for a week (7 days) that's 7 pounds of coffee, which costs 7 * $6 = $42.

Don't forget the donut! That's another $2.

So in total, everything costs $42 + $2 = $44. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Gus spent $20 total.  The chips were $2 each, so that's $4. The chicken was $8 and the soda was $1.  That means the chips, chicken, and soda cost $4 + $8 + $1 = $13.  So the apple pie must have cost $20 - $13 = $7. 


$7.00
"
"Okay, so James delivers 600 newspapers total.  He does 198 for District A and 209 for District C.  That's 198 + 209 = 407 newspapers.  

If he delivers 407 to those two districts, he must deliver 600 - 407 = 193 to District B.


193 

"
"Okay, so John's class is 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 hours a week.

Over 6 weeks, that's 8 * 6 = 48 hours total.

He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, so he learns 48 / 1.5 = 32 recipes. 


32 

"
"Okay, so there are 150 teachers in total, and 60% of them are history teachers. That means there are 150 * 0.60 = 90 history teachers.  

That leaves 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, so all the math teachers together sleep for 60 * 6 = 360 hours.


360 

"
"Okay, so Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $150.  

If they put all their money together, they'd have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.  

Splitting that evenly between the three of them means each person would get $120. 


$120
"
"Okay, so the game has four quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes. That means the regular game is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes long.  But they played an extra 5 minutes because of the tie. So the whole game was 48 + 5 = 53 minutes long. 

53 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the 50 employees are managers, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 managers.  Out of those managers, 30% oversee the whole company, so that's 10 * 0.30 = 3 employees.


3 

"
"Okay, so she needs 8.25 tablespoons of stuff for each muffin.  If she's making 16 muffins, that's 8.25 times 16, which is 132 tablespoons. 


132 

"
"Okay, so they have a total of 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds of candy.  Since they're splitting it evenly between the three of them, each person would get 12 / 3 = 4 pounds of candy. 

4 

"
"Okay, so Adam bought 7 candies of type A at $0.50 each, which is 7 * $0.50 = $3.50. He also got 10 candies of type B at $0.75 each, so that's 10 * $0.75 = $7.50.  In total, his candies cost $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00. If he paid with $15.00, his change would be $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00.


$4.00 

"
"Okay, so Christina had 12 good days total. She already had 8 good days, then one more good day, and then another good day. That's 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 good days.  

If she started with 12 good days and already had 10, then she has 12 - 10 = 2 good days left. 


2 

"
"Let's think about this. Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.  That means if we take away 3 from Janey's 21 books, we'd have twice the number Sally has. 

So, 21 - 3 = 18.

Since 18 is twice the number Sally has, we divide that by 2 to find out how many books Sally has: 18 / 2 = 9.


Sally has 9 books. 

"
"Okay, so the bamboo grows 30 inches every day.  It's currently 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches.  We want to know how many days it takes to reach 600 inches.

First, we need to figure out how much more it needs to grow: 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

Then, we divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate: 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.


12 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 8 more toys for the 8 new dogs that arrived.  That's 8 toys.

Then, the number of dogs doubles, meaning there are 16 more dogs! So he needs 16 more toys for those pups. That's 8 + 16 = 24 toys total.

But wait, 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore.  

That means James needs 24 - 3 = 21 toys. 


21 

"
"Okay, so they put in a total of $1200. Dylan put in 2/5 of that, which is $480 (because 2/5 times 1200 is 480).  That leaves $720 left. Frances put in 2/3 of that, which is another $480.  So, Skyler must have put in the rest, which is $240. 


$240
"
"Okay, so Carol and Jennifer have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures already. They want to get to 100, so they need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures. 


36
"
"Okay, so Karen makes double what Lorie makes, which is $10 an hour times 2, so she makes $20 an hour. If she works 3 hours a day, she makes $20 times 3, which is $60 a day. Over two days, she'd make $60 times 2, so that's $120.


120 

"
"Okay, so if 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns (36 / 6 = 6).  If you have 96 potatoes, you can make a ton of hash browns!  You'd multiply the number of potatoes by the hash browns per potato: 96 potatoes * 6 hash browns/potato = 576 hash browns.


576 

"
"Okay, so the elevator can hold 700 kg.  Jack weighs 80 kg, and there are 8 other adults, each weighing 80 kg too.  So that's 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg for the other adults.

Adding Jack's weight, that's a total of 640 kg + 80 kg = 720 kg.

They're going over the limit by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.


298 

"
"Okay, so Shania's dress is 140cm long now.  She added 20cm of lace, so before that it was 140 - 20 = 120cm long.

But that 120cm includes the extra 50% she added.  If 120cm is 150% of the original length, then we need to figure out what 100% is.

You can think of it like this: 120cm is to 150% as  'x' (the original length) is to 100%.

To solve this, you can set up a proportion: 120/150 = x/100

Cross-multiplying gives us: 120 * 100 = 150 * x

Simplifying: 12000 = 150x

Dividing both sides by 150: x = 80 


So the original dress was 80cm long. 

"
"Okay, so Chris mows his whole lawn in an hour on turtle mode, which is 60 minutes.  In rabbit mode, it takes him 40 minutes.  If he does half in each mode, that's 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes for the turtle part and 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes for the rabbit part.  Adding those together, it takes him 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.


50 

"
"Okay, so they've already spent 6 minutes getting to the library and another 13 to the fire station. That's a total of 19 minutes.  They have 30 minutes total to get to school, so they have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left.


11 

"
"Okay, let's break down the cost:

* The apples cost $4.
* The bananas cost $2 per kilo, and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $2 * 2 = $4.
* The oranges cost $3 per kilo, and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $3 * 2 = $6.

Adding it all up: $4 + $4 + $6 = $14


14
"
"Okay, so Celinda bakes double the amount Greta does, which is 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.  That means they baked a total of 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. After eating 10, they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left for the box.


80 

"
"Okay, so we've got twins and triplets, and we need to figure out how old one of the twins is.  

We know:

* One twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets.
* All their ages added up equal 44.

Let's think about it this way:

If we call the triplet's age ""x"", the older twin is ""x + 7"".  Since there are two twins, their combined age is ""2x + 14"". The triplets' combined age is ""3x"".

We know 2x + 14 + 3x = 44

Combining like terms, we get 5x + 14 = 44

Subtract 14 from both sides: 5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5: x = 6

So, one triplet is 6 years old.  That means one twin is 6 + 7 = 13 years old.


13
"
"Okay, so John has 3 hours until dinner, which is 180 minutes.  He needs 20 minutes for math, 40 for reading, and 20 for history, for a total of 80 minutes of homework.  That means he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes left for a nap. 


100 

"
"Okay, so Manolo buys 5 lollipops at $0.40 each, which is a total of $2.00.  That means the candies cost $1.20.  Since he bought 4 candies, each one costs $0.30.

If he buys 10 lollipops, that's $4.00 (10 x $0.40).  Ten candies would cost $3.00 (10 x $0.30).

So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost him a total of $7.00. 


$7.00
"
"Okay, so Rong saves 20 coins a month, and Neil saves 2/5 more than that.  That means Neil saves 2/5 * 20 = 8 more coins than Rong, so he saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins a month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.


5760 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's $20 x 2 = $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, but we don't know the total yet.  Let's say the total bill is ""x"". We know 0.60x = the cost of the heartworm check.

So, the total bill is $40 (vaccines) + the heartworm check.  

Since the heartworm check is 60% of the total, we can set up an equation:

x = $40 + 0.60x

Let's solve for x:

0.40x = $40

x = $100

So the total bill is $100.  If John brought $125, he'll have $125 - $100 = $25 left. 


$25 

"
"Okay, so they have 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges in a crate.

Apples cost $0.50 each, and bananas are twice that, so they're $1.00 each. Oranges are three times the price of a banana, making them $3.00 each.

Let's see... 5 bananas cost $5.00, 12 apples cost $6.00, and 7 oranges cost $21.00.

Adding those up, the whole crate costs $32.00. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Brittany has 14 red squares, and 4 more blue squares than that, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.

She has 6 more green squares than blue squares, meaning she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.

She has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.

Adding all the squares together, she has 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet. 


68 

"
"Okay, so Mia needs enough chairs for 42 adults and 15 babies, which is a total of 57 people.  She already has 8 high chairs and 5 times that many regular chairs, so she has 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs. That means she has a total of 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.

She needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs. 


9 

"
"Okay, so half of the deer are bucks, which is 50 deer / 2 = 25 bucks.  Then, 20% of those bucks have 8 points, so that's 25 bucks * 0.20 = 5 bucks.


5 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Betty got 30% more points than Adam's 50, so she has 50 + (0.30 * 50) = 65 points.

Tom has 30 less points than Betty, meaning he has 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta did really well, getting 3 times Tom's amount, so she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they're still short 400 - 255 = 145 points. 


145
"
"Okay, so Great Grandma Jones has 3 kids. Each of those kids has 3 kids, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 grandkids.  Then each of those grandkids has 3 babies, so that's 9 * 3 = 27 great-grandbabies. 

27 

"
"Okay, so Greta makes $2400.  She saves half of that for retirement, which is $1200. Then she spends $480 on her car payment (that's 20% of her paycheck).  

So, to find out how much she has left, I'd add her retirement savings and car payment: $1200 + $480 = $1680.

Then I'd subtract that from her total paycheck: $2400 - $1680 = $720.


Greta has $720 left to spend. 

"
"Okay, so there are 20 spots for pencils, but 4 are missing. That means there are 16 pencils left in the box.  Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by 2: 16 pencils / 2 pencils/pair = 8 pairs.


8 

"
"Okay, so the city is setting off a ton of fireworks!  They have 15 boxes with 20 fireworks in each, so that's 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks. Hannah can only see 40% of those, which is 300 * 0.40 = 120 fireworks.

Hannah's also setting off her own fireworks, 3 boxes with 5 in each, for a total of 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.

Adding those together, Hannah will see 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks. 


135
"
"Okay, so there are 20 people in total going to the movies.  Each person gets two drinks and three snacks, so that's 40 drinks and 60 snacks. Since each drink and snack costs $2, they spent 100 items * $2/item = $200 on snacks and drinks.


$200 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Gissela's truck holds 4000 pounds. Gordy's truck is bigger, holding 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so that's 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds.

Together, Gissela and Gordy can carry 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds.

If all three trucks together can carry 11600 pounds, then Gary's truck must carry 11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds.


2800 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 guys and 6 girls. The girls each ate 3 dumplings. The guys ate one more than the girls, so they ate 4 dumplings each.  

That means the guys ate a total of 8 guys * 4 dumplings/guy = 32 dumplings.

The girls ate a total of 6 girls * 3 dumplings/girl = 18 dumplings.

In total, Larry cooked 32 dumplings + 18 dumplings = 50 dumplings.


50 

"
"Okay, so Gerald and Julia split $100, and the ratio is 3:2. That means there are 5 parts total (3 + 2 = 5). Each part is worth $20 ($100 / 5 = $20).

Gerald gets 3 parts, so he starts with $60 (3 * $20 = $60).  After buying the book, he has $50 left ($60 - $10 = $50).


$50
"
"Okay, so the cat is super fast at 15 feet per second. The turtle is way slower, like 5 times slower.  That means the turtle goes 15 feet per second / 5 = 3 feet per second.

If the turtle crawls for 40 seconds, it'll cover 3 feet per second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.


120 

"
"Okay, so they want to raise $6300 and they already have $2100. That means they need $4200 more.

If they raise $700 each hour, they'll need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal. 



"
"Okay, so Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the river.  And 80% of *that* water goes to factories and stuff. That means the other 20% is used for things like homes and farms.  So, 20% of the 40% the city uses is for non-industrial stuff.  

To figure that out, you multiply 20% times 40%, which is 8%.


8 

"
"Okay, so Alex makes $12 each day tutoring.  If she tutors for two whole weeks, that's 14 days (2 weeks * 7 days/week).  So she'd make $12/day * 14 days = $168.


168 

"
"Okay, so they make 100 quarts of chocolate in 2 hours, which means they make 50 quarts each hour.  They make 50 quarts of vanilla in 4 hours, so that's 12.5 quarts per hour.  Together, that's 62.5 quarts every hour.  

If they keep that up for 48 hours, they'd make 62.5 times 48, which is 3000 quarts.


3000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

* The croissants cost 5 * $3.00 = $15.00
* The cinnamon rolls cost 4 * $2.50 = $10.00
* The quiches cost 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
* The muffins cost 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

So, before the discount, his total is $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

His discount is $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

That means his final bill is $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00 


$45.00
"
"Okay, so Erin wants to get the most ice cream for her money.  Since she gets one free scoop for every two she buys, she should buy enough for a full set of three scoops. That way, she uses the deal and doesn't waste any money. Three scoops cost $4.50, and she has $6.00, so she can definitely afford it.

3 

"
"Okay, so Ginger and Amy both start with 100 candies. Ginger eats 4 a day, and Amy eats 3 a day.  That means over two weeks (14 days), Ginger eats 4 * 14 = 56 candies. Amy eats 3 * 14 = 42 candies.

So Ginger has 100 - 56 = 44 candies left. Amy has 100 - 42 = 58 candies left.

Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more candies than Ginger.


14 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his bathroom, which is 36 square feet. That means he's covering 36 times (2/3), which is 24 square feet.  Since he needs 24 tiles per square foot, he'll need 24 times 24 tiles, which is 576 tiles.


576 

"
"Okay, so James paid $20 to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries he picked. He got 30 pounds, so that's 30 * $1.50 = $45 just for the blueberries.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost him $2.50 a pound, so that's 30 * $2.50 = $75.

He saved $75 - $65 = $10 by picking his own.


Answer: 10 

"
"Okay, so they wanted to spend $700 per computer, but the price went up by 10%.  That means each computer now costs $700 + ($700 * 0.10) = $770.

Since they're buying 500 computers, the total cost would be $770 * 500 = $385,000. 


$385,000
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* The eggs have 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.
* The cheese has 2 ounces * 120 calories/ounce = 240 calories.
* The ham also has 2 ounces * 40 calories/ounce = 80 calories.

Adding those all up, the omelet has 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories. 


770
"
"Okay, so you bought 6 pencils at 50 cents each, that's 6 times 0.50 which is $3.00. Then you got 8 erasers at 25 cents each, so that's 8 times 0.25, which equals $2.00.  In total, you spent $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00. Since you paid with a $10 bill, your change would be $10.00 - $5.00 = $5.00.


$5.00 

"
"Okay, so 30% of the 100 people get interviews, which is 30 people. Then 20% of those 30 get job offers, so that's 6 people.  Finally, only a third of those 6 people take the job, which is 2 people. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Goldy gave away 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks of rice.  Since each sack has 25 kilograms, she gave away a total of 7 * 25 = 175 kilograms of rice. 


175 

"
"Okay, so Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, which is a total of 8 boxes this week. Last week she bought 4 boxes.  That means she bought 4 more boxes this week.

"
"Okay, so Helga's a fast dancer! Let's break it down:

* When her arms are down, she taps 300 times with one foot and 250 with the other, so that's 550 taps per minute.
* Her arms are down for 3 minutes, so that's 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.
* With her arms up, she taps 200 times per minute with each foot, for a total of 400 taps per minute.
* Her arms are up for 2 minutes, so that's 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

In total, she taps 1650 + 800 = 2450 times. 


2450
"
"Okay, so Ron's car will get messed up if the pothole isn't fixed, costing him $450.  But the city will fine him $120 if he fixes it himself, plus he needs to buy asphalt which is $25 a bucket and he needs three buckets.

So that's $25 x 3 = $75 for the asphalt.

Then add the fine: $75 + $120 = $195.

That means he saves $450 - $195 = $255 by fixing it himself.


$255 

"
"Okay, so they started with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, that's a total of 193 chairs.  Then they took away 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs, so they took away 33 chairs in total.  That means they have 193 - 33 = 160 chairs left.


160 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 pizzas total, and each has 12 slices, meaning there are 60 slices altogether. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which is like eating 8 slices each, for a total of 24 slices. The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 9 slices each, for a total of 18 slices.  

Adding those up, they ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.

That means there are 60 - 42 = 18 slices left. 


18
"
"Okay, so the cat takes 30 minutes to eat nine sausages. The dog is faster and eats them in 2/3 of that time, which is 20 minutes.  To find the average, we add the cat's time and the dog's time (30 + 20 = 50 minutes) and then divide by 2 because we have two animals. 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.


25 

"
"Okay, so Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long.  That's 96 inches plus 4 inches, so it's 100 inches long.

The problem says Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So if we let 'x' be the length of Bobby's shoe, we can set up an equation:

100 = 9x + 10

Subtract 10 from both sides: 90 = 9x

Divide both sides by 9: x = 10

So Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Hannah smashes a quarter of the student cars, which is 64 / 4 = 16 cars.  Since each of those cars has 4 windows, that's 16 * 4 = 64 windows.

Then she smashes windows on 3/4 of the teacher cars, which is 3/4 * 32 = 24 cars. Those cars each have 2 windows, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 windows.

In total, she smashes 64 + 48 = 112 windows. 


112
"
"Okay, so Candy has a bunch of thread. Let's see... 15 light blue + 45 dark blue = 60 blue spools total.  She has 150 spools all together.  

To find the percentage, you do (blue spools / total spools) * 100. So that's (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

40 

"
"Okay, so 5000 people started in line. By midday, 2/5 of them voted, which is 2000 people (because 2/5 times 5000 is 2000). That leaves 3000 people who haven't voted yet.

Then, by 4 pm, 2/3 of those remaining people voted. So, 2000 more people voted (2/3 times 3000 is 2000).

That means 1000 people still haven't voted by 4 pm. 


1000
"
"Okay, so Parker needs gum for 30 days and chews 4 pieces a day. That's 30 * 4 = 120 pieces of gum total.  Each pack has 15 pieces, so he'll need 120 / 15 = 8 packs. 

8 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

So, the kids want 18 smores total (9 kids x 2 smores each) and the adults want 6 smores. That's 24 smores in all.

Each box has enough for 24 smores (3 sleeves x 8 smores per sleeve).

So they'll only need 1 box of graham crackers. 


1 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Dora is 15. Her dad is eight more than twice her age, so he's (15 * 2) + 8 = 38 years old. Her mom is four years younger than her dad, making her 38 - 4 = 34 years old.  

To find their total combined age, we add them all up: 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old. 


87
"
"Okay, so Greg found $20 and has to split it evenly with his 3 siblings, that means there are 4 people total sharing the money.  

To find out how much each person gets, you divide the total money by the number of people: $20 / 4 = $5. 


So each person gets $5. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  Her math and science books each weigh 2 pounds, so those are 2 * 2 = 4 pounds total. Her history book is twice her English book, which is 3 pounds, so history is 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.  Adding it all up: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

17 

"
"Okay, so candidate A got 20% of the votes, and candidate B got 50% more than that.  That means B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.

Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes.

That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for candidate C.

Since there were 100 voters, candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes. 


50 

"
"Okay, so Boris starts with 100 apples, and Beck has 23 less, meaning Beck has 77 apples.  If Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck now has 87. Boris would then have 90 apples left.  That means Boris has 3 more apples than Beck. 


3 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

He uses 12 ounces for the giant cubes (3 cubes * 4 ounces each), 14 ounces for the medium cubes (7 cubes * 2 ounces each), and 4 ounces for the small cubes (8 cubes * 0.5 ounces each).

That's a total of 30 ounces used (12 + 14 + 4).

Since he started with 32 ounces, he has 2 ounces left (32 - 30). 


2 

"
"Okay, so Clara has 20 books and that's twice the number Steven has.  That means Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.


4 

"
"Okay, so a gallon of milk costs $5, and a half-gallon costs $3 less, which is $2.  

That means 10 gallons would cost 10 * $5 = $50.

And 16 half-gallons would cost 16 * $3 = $48.

Adding those together, Cecelia spent $50 + $48 = $98. 


98
"
"Okay, so 10 students like baking and 5 like basketball. That means 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 students like video games or music.  If 5 like basketball and twice that number like music, then 5 * 2 = 10 students like music.  That leaves 35 - 10 = 25 students who like video games.


25 

"
"Okay, so Jeremy starts with 12 birds. He scares away a third of them, which is 12 / 3 = 4 birds. That leaves 12 - 4 = 8 birds. Then 20 more show up, so there are 8 + 20 = 28 birds in total. 


28
"
"Okay, so there are 80 students total split evenly between two classes, meaning each class has 40 students.  If 40% are girls, that means 60% must be boys.  

To find out how many boys are in each class, we do 40 students * 60% = 24 boys.


24 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Mara starts with 2 slices, adds 3 more, so that's 2 + 3 = 5 slices. Then she triples that amount, which is 5 * 3 = 15 slices.  She eats 2, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 slices. Finally, her friend takes 5, so there are 13 - 5 = 8 slices left.


8 

"
"Okay, so Melissa has to groom a bunch of animals this week. Let's see... 8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses is a total of 28 animals.  Since there are 7 days in a week, she'll groom 28 animals / 7 days = 4 animals each day. 


4 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Mark spent 3 * $1800 = $5400 on the packs.

He made $4000 + $1000 = $5000 from the two really good cards.

The other cards brought in 30 * $50 = $1500.

So in total, he made $5000 + $1500 = $6500.

That means his profit was $6500 - $5400 = $1100. 


$1100
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

At the first park, two adults would cost 2 * $26 = $52.  Two kids would cost 2 * $12 = $24.  So that park would be $52 + $24 = $76 total.

The second park is $14 per adult, so that's 2 * $14 = $28. Two kids would cost 2 * $10 = $20. That park would be $28 + $20 = $48.

They'd save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.


$28 

"
"Okay, so he saves $0.10 per tomato with the new vendor.  Since he sells 500 tomatoes a day, that's a savings of $0.10/tomato * 500 tomatoes = $50 every day.

Over a week, he saves $50/day * 7 days = $350. 


$350
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Sean has 56 marbles. Cal has twice that amount, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times the number Sean has, meaning Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.  

To find the total for Carl and Cal, we add their marbles together: 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.


336 

"
"Okay, so they have 54 students and want to split them into 12 groups.  If they're making groups of the same size, they already have enough for 6 groups (54 / 6 = 9 students per group).  To get to 12 groups, they need 6 more groups. 


6 

"
"Okay, so Candy rents out 60 chairs each day during the week, and that's 5 days a week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 chairs.

On the weekends, she rents out 100 chairs each day for 2 days, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 chairs.

That means she rents out a total of 300 + 200 = 500 chairs every week.

In a month, which has 4 weeks, she'd rent out 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs.

For two months, it would be 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.


4000 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Gunther starts with 48 bananas. Arnold takes half, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. That leaves Gunther with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

Then Gunther adds 25 more, so he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas. But then Arnold sneaks in again and takes 12, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, bringing his total to 37 + 6 = 43 bananas. 


So the answer is 43. 

"
"Okay, so there are 4 roommates splitting a $100 electricity bill. That means each roommate pays $100 / 4 = $25 each month.  Over a year, that's $25/month * 12 months = $300. 


$300
"
"Okay, so Jeff started with 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, or 96 glasses. He also had 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, or 48 plates.  

Then, some stuff broke - 10 glasses and 6 plates.  So, he has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses left and 48 - 6 = 42 plates left.

That means he has a total of 86 + 42 = 128 glasses and plates now. 


128 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Lorraine starts with a lot of stickers! She's got 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.  

First, she trades most of her small stickers for big buttons. Since each small sticker gets her one small button, and she trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, that's 27 small buttons. She can then trade those 27 small buttons for 9 large buttons (because 27 divided by 3 is 9).

Next, she trades half of her big stickers for more big buttons. That's 20 big stickers traded for 20 big buttons.

She has 20 big stickers left, and she trades those for small buttons. Each big sticker gets her 3 small buttons, so that's 60 small buttons.

Finally, let's add up all her buttons: 27 small buttons + 20 large buttons + 60 small buttons = 107 buttons!



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  Joey played 2 games on Monday, 1 on Friday, and then double the Monday amount on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 games.  

So in total, he played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 games. 


7 

"
"Okay, so there were twice as many ""yes"" votes as ""no"" votes.  If you add the ""yes"" and ""no"" votes together, that's everyone on the council, which is 33 people.  

Let's think of it like this: if the ""no"" votes were 1 part, the ""yes"" votes would be 2 parts. That makes a total of 3 parts.

So, each ""part"" is 33 people / 3 parts = 11 people.

Since the ""yes"" votes are 2 parts, there were 2 parts * 11 people/part = 22 votes in favor.


22 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

*  If 11 kids need extra-small shirts, and twice that many need small, then 11 * 2 = 22 kids need small shirts.
* Four less than the number needing small need medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 kids need medium.
* Half as many kids need large as medium, meaning 18 / 2 = 9 kids need large shirts.
* Finally, 6 more kids need extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 kids need extra-large.

To find the total, we add up all the sizes: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts. 

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts. 



"
"Okay, so the bag is 5% off, which means we need to figure out what 5% of $140 is.  

5% is like 0.05, so 0.05 times $140 is $7.  That's how much the discount is.

So, you'd pay $140 minus $7, which is $133.



"
"Okay, so John has a lot of music!  Let's see... 20 playlists with 300 songs each means he has 20 * 300 = 6000 songs total.

Since each song is 10 hours long, all those songs together would last 6000 * 10 = 60000 hours. 


60000 

"
"Okay, so 20% of 50 people is 10 people who like horse #2. That leaves 40 people.  Then 60% of those 40 people like horse #7, so that's 24 people.  That means 16 people must like horse #12. 


16
"
"Okay, so if 6 Pomeranian girls are one-third of all the Pomeranians, then there are 6 * 3 = 18 Pomeranians total.  Since Pomeranians are two-thirds of all her puppies, Jana has 18 * 3 / 2 = 27 puppies. 

27 

"
"Okay, so Jayden starts with $70. His sister gives him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45.  That means he has $70 + $45 = $115.  

The camera costs $200, so he still needs $200 - $115 = $85.


$85 

"
"Okay, so they need 250 cases total. The second house needs a mystery amount, let's call it 'x'. The first house needs half of that, so x/2. The third house needs double the first house, so that's x.

Adding them all up: x/2 + x + x = 250

That's the same as 2.5x = 250

Divide both sides by 2.5 and you get x = 100.

So the third house needs 100 cases of shingles. 


100
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Leila spent 3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6. Jack spent 5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5. And Chase spent $3 on his lettuce.  

Adding those up, they spent a total of $6 + $5 + $3 = $14 on their salad.


14 

"
"Okay, so George has 45% more pears than bananas, and he has 200 bananas.  

That means he has 200 * 0.45 = 90 more pears than bananas.

So, he has 200 + 90 = 290 pears.

In total, he has 290 pears + 200 bananas = 490 fruits. 


490 

"
"Okay, so Marissa had $80 and spent $20 on a ball. That means she has $60 left for candy bars.  Since each candy bar costs $5, she could buy $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars. 


12
"
"Okay, so Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for every liter of juice.  If he wants to make 4 liters, he'll need 4 * 5 = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Since each kilogram costs $3, the total cost would be 20 * $3 = $60. 


$60
"
"Okay, so Ezra read 300 books, and that's twice the number Ahmed read.  That means Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.

Ezra then reads 150 more, bringing his total to 300 + 150 = 450 books.

To find the total, we add Ezra's books and Ahmed's books: 450 + 150 = 600 books.


600 

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Tanya made.

On Monday, she taught 4 classes for 5 hours, so she earned $15/hour * 5 hours = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 bonus, bringing her Monday total to $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she taught 2 classes for 2 hours, earning $15/hour * 2 hours = $30.  She didn't teach more than 3 classes, so no bonus for Wednesday.

Adding up both days, she made $80 + $30 = $110.


110 

"
"Okay, so they sold 5 of each vanilla scent, and they have 4 vanilla scents, that's 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents sold.

They sold 2 of each fruity scent, and they have 8 fruity scents, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 fruity scents sold.

They sold 20 - 16 = 4 more vanilla scents than fruity scents.


4 

"
"Okay, so Bennet makes $60 from the eggplants (20 eggplants * $3/eggplant).  That means he needs to make another $75 from the corn ($135 - $60 = $75).

To figure out how much each ear of corn should cost, we divide the total he needs from corn by the number of ears: $75 / 25 ears = $3/ear. 


$3
"
"Okay, so Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday, that's 12 hours total. She reads for 3 hours, leaving 9 hours.  She spends a third of that time on video games, which is 3 hours. That means she has 6 hours left for soccer.  

Since she has 12 hours total and spends 6 on soccer, that's 50% of her weekend. 


50
"
"Okay, so Anthony starts with 50 pencils. He gives half to Brandon, which is 25 pencils. That leaves him with 25 pencils. Then he gives Charlie 3/5 of those, which is 15 pencils (because 3/5 times 25 is 15).  That means Anthony kept 10 pencils. 


10
"
"Okay, so Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and then 150 miles back home, for a total of 300 miles.  Since he drives 75 mph, that means he spends 4 hours driving (300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours).  

He also spends 6 hours at the museum, so in total, he's gone for 10 hours (4 hours + 6 hours).


10 

"
"Okay, so Henry needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Cars need 4 wheels each, and motorcycles need 2.  

Let's see... 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels for the cars.

And 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

That means he needs a total of 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

He has 650 wheels, so he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over. 


276 

"
"Okay, so a 20% discount means you save 20% of $1000.  To find that, you multiply 1000 by 0.20 (which is the same as 20/100). That gives you $200.  So you subtract that from the original price: $1000 - $200 = $800. 



"
"Okay, so Mike has a lot of movies! Let's figure this out step-by-step.

First, he has 600 movies and a third of them are in series, so that's 600 / 3 = 200 movies.  Since he can get those cheaper, they'll cost him 200 * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves him with 600 - 200 = 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, which is 400 * 0.40 = 160 movies. Those will cost him 160 * $5 = $800.

That means there are 400 - 160 = 240 newer movies left. Those will cost him 240 * $10 = $2400.

Finally, to get the total cost, we add up all the prices: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67.



$3866.67
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Peaches cost $2 a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's 2 * 6 = $12.

Plums are $1 a pound and he got 8 pounds, so that's 1 * 8 = $8.

Apricots are $3 a pound and he got 6 pounds, so that's 3 * 6 = $18.

Adding it all up, he spent $12 + $8 + $18 = $38 on fruit. 



"
"Okay, so they drove for 4.5 hours (6 hours total - 1.5 hours hiking) at 50 miles per hour, which means they drove 225 miles (4.5 hours * 50 miles/hour).  Then they hiked for 1.5 hours at 20 miles per hour (half their driving speed minus 5), covering 30 miles (1.5 hours * 20 miles/hour).

Adding those together, their vacation spot is 255 miles away. 


255
"
"This problem is a bit tricky because we don't know exactly how many enemies they each jump on or how many berries they collect.  We also don't know how much time is left on the timer. 

To figure out the difference in their scores, we'd need to know those things.  

Let's say Emma jumps on 5 enemies and collects 2 berries, and has 10 seconds left on the timer. We could then figure out her score and compare it to Ava's score based on the information given. 

"
"Okay, so they spent $64 on four pizzas, and two of them cost $30. That means the other two pizzas cost $34 altogether.  If they cost the same amount, each of those pizzas cost $17. 


$17
"
"Okay, so they ride 3 times a day for 5 days, which is 3 * 5 = 15 times.

Then there are two days where they ride twice as much, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 times each of those days.

That's another 6 * 2 = 12 times.

In total, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times a week. 


27
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Bob starts with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He buys 17 more fish, but we don't know how many are orange or white.  

After he adds the new fish, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This means if we let 'w' be the number of white fish he bought, he bought 2(4 + w) orange fish.

We know the total number of orange fish is 3 + (17 - w) because he started with 3 and the new fish could be a mix.

So, we can set up an equation: 3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

* 3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
* 20 - w = 8 + 2w
* 12 = 3w
* w = 4


Bob bought 4 white fish. 

"
"Okay, so Andy drives 5 miles to work each way, so that's 10 miles a day.  He works 5 days a week, so he drives 50 miles total. His car gets 10 miles to the gallon, so he uses 5 gallons of gas each week. If gas costs $3 a gallon, then he spends 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 a week on gas.


$15 

"
"Okay, so Carrie got ten twenties, which is like $200. She also got 140 quarters, and that's $35.  She used up all the quarters, so that's $35 right there. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is like 3/5 * $200 = $120.

Adding that all up, she spent $120 + $35 = $155 on lunch.


155 

"
"Okay, so Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and each one gives him 22 tomatoes, that's 5 * 22 = 110 tomatoes.  He also has 8 eggplant plants and each one gives him 4 eggplants, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 eggplants.  In total, he'll get 110 + 32 = 142 fruits.


142 

"
"Okay, so Samwell sold 40 TVs total.  A quarter of them were smart TVs, which is 40 / 4 = 10 TVs. Then 1/8 were analog, so that's 40 / 8 = 5 TVs.  

That means 10 + 5 = 15 TVs were either smart or analog.  

So, 40 - 15 = 25 TVs must have been OLEDs.


25 

"
"Okay, so the school is paying for half the trip, which is $300 / 2 = $150.  That means John still needs to come up with $300 - $150 = $150. Since he already has $50, he's still missing $150 - $50 = $100.


$100 

"
"Okay, so it's 45 degrees during the day, but it gets 33 degrees colder at night. That means it's 12 degrees at night (45 - 33 = 12).  

The pipes will freeze if it gets below 32 degrees, so Carson needs to warm the house up by 20 degrees (32 - 12 = 20).

Each log raises the temperature by 5 degrees, so he needs to burn 4 logs (20 / 5 = 4). 


4 

"
"Okay, so there are 90 people and they need to be in groups of 9. That means there are 90 / 9 = 10 groups.

Three-fifths of the groups brought back seashells, so that's (3/5) * 10 = 6 groups.

Each person in those groups brought back 2 seashells, and there are 9 people in each group, so that's 6 groups * 2 seashells/person * 9 people/group = 108 seashells.


108 

"
"Okay, so there are 172 people on the train to start. Then 47 get off, so that's 172 - 47 = 125 people.  But wait, 13 more get on, so now there are 125 + 13 = 138 people. Finally, 38 more get off, leaving 138 - 38 = 100 people on the train.


100 

"
"Okay, so Damien finds 10 bottle caps every day, and each one is worth 25 cents. That means he makes $2.50 each day (10 x $0.25 = $2.50).

Over a month with 30 days, he'd make $75.00 ( $2.50 x 30 = $75.00).


$75.00 

"
"Okay, so Jamie makes $20 an hour for her regular 8 hours. That's $20 * 8 = $160.

She worked 3 extra hours, so that's 3 hours * $20 * 1.50 (for the overtime rate) = $90.

Adding that to her regular pay, she made $160 + $90 = $250 for the day.


$250 

"
"Okay, so there are 12 female lions, and half that number of males, which is 6.  Then there are 14 cubs.  Adding those all up, there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions in total. 

32 

"
"Okay, so the jeans are 25% off, and they originally cost $40.  That means the discount is $40 * 0.25 = $10.  

So the jeans are on sale for $40 - $10 = $30.

If Mike pays with a $50 bill, he'll get $50 - $30 = $20 in change.


$20.00 

"
"Okay, so they start with 200 people, and add 20 more each month for three months. That's 20 * 3 = 60 new people.

So now they have 200 + 60 = 260 employees.

If each person makes $4000 a month, the company pays 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.


1040000 

"
"Okay, so they sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, and that song is 150 seconds long, so that's 150 * 2 = 300 seconds. Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, which is 240 seconds.  

To find the total time, we add those together: 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.


540 

"
"Okay, so Billy gets raises a couple times, right? First he makes $10 an hour, then gets a 50 cent raise, so that's $10.50. Then he gets another dollar raise, bringing him to $11.50 an hour.

Sally starts at $10.50, which is 50 cents more than Billy started at.

If they both work 20 hours, Billy makes $11.50 * 20 = $230.

Sally makes $10.50 * 20 = $210.

So Billy makes $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.


$20 

"
"Okay, so 3 loaves of bread would cost 3 * $2 = $6.  Two bagels would cost 2 * $1 = $2.  That means 3 loaves cost $6 - $2 = $4 more than 2 bagels.


$4 

"
"Okay, so Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score, so half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139.  Then Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

To find the total, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores: 278 + 150 = 428.


428 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 classes with 25 kids each, that's 40 * 25 = 1000 students.  And each class has 3 teachers, so there are 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

The students plant one tree each, so that's 1000 trees. The teachers plant two each, so that's 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

In total, they plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees. 


1240
"
"Okay, so Bubbles has 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals total.

She wants goats to be 30% of her collection, so that's 14 * 0.30 = 4.2.  

Since you can't buy parts of a stuffed animal, she needs to buy 5 goats. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Kris wants to play for 30 hours total.  Let's see how much she plays in the first two weeks:

* She plays 30 minutes a day, which is half an hour, so that's 0.5 hours a day.
* Over two weeks, that's 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Then she plays 2 hours a day for a week:

* That's 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

In total, she plays 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

She needs to play 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 more hours to get the achievement. 


9
"
"Okay, so the second car is going 10 miles per hour faster than the first car.  That means every hour, it pulls ahead by 10 miles.  After two hours, it will be 20 miles ahead. 


20
"
"Okay, so the diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300, so that's $600 + $300 = $900 in total for the materials.

But there's also a 30% premium on top of that.  So we need to find 30% of $900, which is $900 * 0.30 = $270.

Finally, we add the premium to the original cost: $900 + $270 = $1170.

So James paid $1170 for the ring. 


$1170
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

So, 340 out of 500 third graders passed, which is a good chunk! Then 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed.  The fifth graders did even better - twice the rate of the fourth graders, so 80% passed. That means 320 fifth graders passed.

In total, 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 students passed.

Since there are 1000 students total, the school's overall pass rate is 70%. 


70
"
"Okay, so Milo needs 12 chips for every square inch of his mosaic.  Since it's 3 inches tall, that's 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips per inch of length he wants to make. He has two bags of chips, which is 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips total.  

So, he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long. 


4 

"
"Okay, so first we gotta figure out how much tea everyone drank.  Four students had 1.5 quarts each, so that's 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. Then 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so that's 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.  

In total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

And since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they started with 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea.


12 

"
"Okay, so Dale started with 100 candies, but then sold 150. That means he must have gotten more! Since he ordered another 100, he now has 200 candies total.  If he already sold 150, he needs to sell 50 more. 


50
"
"Okay, so the number of students doubles every month.  

* At the start, there are 10.
* After one month, there are 10 * 2 = 20.
* Then 20 * 2 = 40
* Then 40 * 2 = 80
* Then 80 * 2 = 160
* And finally, 160 * 2 = 320

That means by the end of May, there are 320 students. Since there were 10 to start, that's 320 - 10 = 310 extra students.


310 

"
"Okay, so Felix made $105 and charges $0.25 per branch. To find out how many branches he climbed total, we divide the total money by the price per branch: $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

If he worked 5 days, we divide the total branches by the number of days to find the average: 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.


84 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

She starts with 3 flowers * 5 petals = 15 petals. Then she adds 4 flowers * 6 petals = 24 petals.  Then 5 flowers * 4 petals = 20 petals. And finally 6 flowers * 7 petals = 42 petals.

That's a total of 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But wait, she drops one of each kind! So that's 5 petals lost.

101 - 5 = 96 petals left.


96 

"
"Okay, so they started with 35 marshmallows. They used 9 each for their s'mores, that's 18 total.  Then they lost 3 more. So, they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left. Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 s'mores.


7 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His friends who aren't as good only get half that time, so they play for 10 minutes per quarter. His really good friend gets to play for 1.5 times as long, which is 30 minutes per quarter.

They play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.  

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His weaker friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and there are two of them, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* His better friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

In total, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00. 


$17.00
"
"Okay, so Tanya's salt scrub recipe is a bit tricky!  Let's break it down.

She uses the same amount of zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Since the jar is 10 ounces, we need to figure out how much of each ingredient she uses to make it all add up.

This is kind of like a puzzle!  

Let's say she uses 1 ounce of zest. That means she also uses 1 ounce of fragrance. Salt would be twice the zest, so 2 ounces. Sugar is the same as salt, so also 2 ounces. Oil is twice the salt, making it 4 ounces.

Adding it all up: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 ounces!

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  He bought 3 goats at $500 each, so that's 3 * $500 = $1500. Then he bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so that's 2 * $1500 = $3000.  

To find the total, we add the cost of the goats and cows: $1500 + $3000 = $4500.


$4500 

"
"Okay, so Paul needs 63 cupcakes total. He already has 8 chocolate ones and 40 toffee ones, which means he has 48 cupcakes already (8 + 40 = 48).  To figure out how many more he needs, we subtract what he has from what he needs: 63 - 48 = 15.

He needs to buy 15 more cupcakes. 



"
"Okay, so Joe has twice the number of cars Robert has, and Robert has 20. That means Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of his cars, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars. Then he gives his mom twice that amount, so he gives her 2 * 8 = 16 cars.

In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.  

That means Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.


16 

"
"Okay, so the charity got $175,000 total, and $50,000 of that was from organizations. That means the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.

Since there are 20 students, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. 


$6,250
"
"Okay, so Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day.  The second day she walked half that time, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.  That means she walked a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.


720 

"
"Okay, so Hunter starts with 50 cars, then sees 20 more, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 cars.  But then half of them leave, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars.  That means there are 35 cars left at lunch. 


35 

"
"Okay, so John does a lot of work! Let's see... he does 30 sets of tasks each day, and each set has 5 tasks.  If each task pays $1.20, that means he makes $6.00 for each set.  So, he makes $180.00 every day (30 sets * $6.00/set).  

Over a whole week, that's $1260.00 ( $180.00/day * 7 days).


$1260.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, and Julie scored 4 less than that, so she got 10 points.  In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 4 points.

To find Sasha's total points, we add her scores from both games: 14 + 4 = 18 points.


18 

"
"Okay, so Kimberly bought a bunch of cat and dog food.  Let's see... she got 8 packs of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.  Then she got 6 packs of dog food with 6 tins each, for a total of 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.  To find the difference, we do 88 - 36 = 52.

She bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Okay, so let's break this down.  

We know there are 341 cards total. Let's say PJ has 'x' number of cards. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to figure out what 'x' is.  We know that all the cards together equal 341, so:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining the 'x' terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7:

x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Let's plug that back into the equation for Becca's cards:

3 * 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153


Becca has 153 cards. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Cindy had 5 green eggs. She had twice that many blue eggs, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Finally, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs. 


27
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, the shipping cost based on weight is $0.35 per pound times 4 pounds, which is $1.40. Then, the shipping cost per mile is $0.08 times 20 miles, so that's $1.60.  Adding those together, the total shipping cost is $3.00.

Amazon will give her back 75% of the $32 price, which is $24.00.

So, to find out how much she loses, we subtract the refund and the shipping from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.


$5.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Mulan starts with $40 and gets $100 from her dad, so she has $140.  The jeans cost $30 each, and she buys two pairs, so that's $30 * 2 = $60.  Adding the $20 bag, her total spending is $60 + $20 = $80.  

Subtracting that from her total money, she has $140 - $80 = $60 left.


$60 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars a month. In the first week, he makes 8,000.  The second week he only makes half of that, which is 4,000 bars. The third week is crazy busy, and he makes three times the amount from the first week, so that's 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars.

So far, he's made 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.

To hit his goal of 50,000, he needs to make 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars in the fourth week.


14000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

First, she spends 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes making TikToks.

Then, she spends 2 hours on songs, which is 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

She also spends 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes on makeup.

So, in a week, she spends a total of 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok stuff.

That means in a month, she spends 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes.

Finally, to make it easier to understand, let's convert that to hours: 1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18.8 hours.


18.8 

"
"Okay, so the basic installation is $129.  Let's see, she has 2 extra mirrors, so that's 2 times $15, which is $30. She has one extra chandelier, so that's another $15. And she has 10 extra pictures, so that's 10 times $15, which is $150.  

Adding it all up: $129 + $30 + $15 + $150 = $324.00 


$324.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Anthony saved $10 more than Eva, who has $20. So Anthony has $30.

Roy saved 40% more than Anthony. That means Roy saved an extra 0.40 * $30 = $12.

Adding that to Anthony's savings, Roy has a total of $30 + $12 = $42.


$42.00 

"
"Okay, so this is like a chain reaction of lifting mountains!

Pompei lifts 1 inch. Saskay lifts 12 times that, so Saskay lifts 12 inches. Kagiyami lifts 4 times what Saskay lifts, meaning Kagiyami lifts 12 * 4 = 48 inches. Finally, Naruto lifts 10 times what Kagiyami lifts, so Naruto lifts 48 * 10 = 480 inches.

But the question asks for feet, and there are 12 inches in a foot. So Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.


40 

"
"Okay, so Mason bikes 8 miles every hour.  He bikes for 4 hours, then rests, and then bikes for another 6 hours.  

To find the total distance, we need to figure out how far he went each time and add them together.

* First part: 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
* Second part: 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

Total distance: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles 

 
80
"
"Okay, so here's how I'd figure this out:

If three kangaroos take 18 hours, that means one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.  

Now, turtles are way slower, right? They're going half the speed of a kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 54 hours, a turtle would take twice as long, which is 108 hours.

But we have four turtles, so we need to think about their combined speed.  Since each turtle takes 108 hours, four of them together would take 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.


27 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, who made 20. So Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Jada made twice as many as Rory, meaning she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.

To find the total, we add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.


140 

"
"Okay, so the laptop costs $600, but it's $200 cheaper if she trades in her old one, so that's $600 - $200 = $400.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80, and she still needs $50, so she must have $150 + $80 + $50 = $280 in total.

If she has $280 and earned $150 + $80 = $230 from her job and mom, then she must have had $280 - $230 = $50 in her purse.


$50 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

He gets 15 slices from the big apples (3 apples * 5 slices/apple) and 15 slices from the small apples (5 apples * 3 slices/apple). That's a total of 30 slices. Since he eats 15, there are 15 slices left. 


15 

"
"Okay, so the farmer gets 5 liters of milk from each cow every day. He has 3 cows, so right now he's getting 5 * 3 = 15 liters.

He wants to get 25 liters, so he needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters.

Since each cow gives 5 liters, he needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows. 


2 

"
"Okay, so each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters.  

* The first one has 1/6 left, so 5/6 is gone. That's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm used up.
* The second one has 2/3 used, meaning 1/3 is left. That's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm left.
* The third one has 1/2 used, so 1/2 is left. That's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm left.

Adding those up, there's a total of 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm of glue stick left.


20 

"
"Okay, so Gabriel needs $10,000 for the car and $800 for the phone, which means the stuff he wants costs $10,800 total. He already has $5000 saved up and his brother gave him $200, so he has $5200.  

To figure out how much more he needs, we subtract what he has from the total cost: $10,800 - $5200 = $5600.

He still needs $5600. 



"
"Okay, so Thea gave the craftsman $80 because she used four $20 bills.  Since the hat only cost $70, she should get $10 back.


$10 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Craig starts with $40 because he has two twenty dollar bills.  The squirt guns cost $12 (6 x $2) and the water balloons cost $9 (3 x $3).  That means he spent a total of $21.  If he started with $40 and spent $21, he has $19 left. 


$19
"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.

Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

In total, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

Adding those together, they have 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes. 


180
"
"Okay, so 5 students are good at only math, and 7 are good at both math and English.  That means 5 + 7 = 12 students are good at math. 


12
"
"Okay, so the concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes.  We need to take out the 10-minute intermission, so that leaves 110 minutes for the performances. Each group takes 10 minutes (2 on + 6 performing + 2 off), so Vicki can fit 11 groups in the concert. 


11
"
"Okay, so Brenda starts with $300.  Each year she earns three-quarters of that amount in interest, which is $300 * (3/4) = $225.

Over three years, her total interest would be $225 * 3 = $675.

Adding that to her original investment, she'll have $300 + $675 = $975 after three years.


$975 

"
"Okay, so there are 40 white shirts and half of them have collars, meaning 20 white shirts don't have collars.  There are 50 floral shirts, and 20 of them have buttons, leaving 30 floral shirts without buttons.  

That means there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars. 


10
"
"Okay, so the farmer has 900 eggs and each tray holds 30. That means he has 900 / 30 = 30 trays of eggs.

If he sells each tray for $2.50, he'll make 30 * $2.50 = $75. 


$75
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats on Farm X and 45 on Farm Y, for a total of 100 goats. He sells 10 from Farm X and 20 from Farm Y (since that's twice the amount from Farm X). That means he sold a total of 30 goats.

If he started with 100 goats and sold 30, he has 70 left.


70 

"
"Okay, so James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month, and that adds up to 24 pairs in a whole year. If he spends $2640 on shoes in a year, we gotta divide that by the 24 pairs to see how much each pair costs.  

$2640 / 24 pairs = $110 per pair 

$110 

"
"Okay, so you're buying 3 baskets of green food which cost $25 each, so that's 3 * $25 = $75.  Then you're getting 3 baskets of red food, which normally cost $18 each, but you get $2 off each one. So the red food costs 3 * $18 = $54, minus the $2 discount for each basket, which is $6 total. That means the red food costs $54 - $6 = $48.

Finally, to find the total cost, you add the cost of the green food and the red food: $75 + $48 = $123.


$123
"
"Okay, so half of the 90 rooms is 45 rooms.  If each room takes 20 minutes to clean, that's 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes of cleaning.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 minutes is equal to 900 / 60 = 15 hours.


15 

"
"Okay, so they build 12 homes the first year. Then they build three times that many the next year, which is 12 * 3 = 36 homes.  So after two years, they've built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.

In the third year, they double the total they already have, so that's 48 * 2 = 96 homes.

Adding that to the homes they already built, they have a total of 48 + 96 = 144 homes.


144

"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Let's say your age is ""x"".

* Your brother is 3 years older, so he's x + 3.
* You're 2 years older than your sister, so she's x - 2.
* Your mom is one less than three times your brother's age, making her 3(x + 3) - 1.

Now, if we add everyone's age, it should equal 87:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87

Let's simplify that:

x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 9 - 1 = 87

Combine the 'x' terms:

6x + 9 = 87

Subtract 9 from both sides:

6x = 78

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 13


So, you are 13 years old.

"Okay, so Mr. Jackson needs 54 glue sticks total (27 students x 2 glue sticks each).  Since each pack has 8 glue sticks, he'll need to buy 7 packs to have enough for everyone.

"
"Okay, so the river starts with 4000 gallons. After the rain, it doubles, which means it has 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons. Then on the third day, it goes up by another 6000 gallons, so that's 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

14000 

"
"Okay, so it starts with 10 people. Each of them infects 6 more people, so that's 10 * 6 = 60 new people on the first day.

Now there are 70 infected people (10 + 60). On day two, those 70 people each infect 6 more, so that's 70 * 6 = 420 new infections.

That brings the total to 490 (70 + 420). On day three, those 490 people infect 6 more each, which is 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections.

Adding that to the people already infected, we get 3430 (490 + 2940).


3430 

"
"Okay, so Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers, so she made 20 * 40 = $800 in tips.

Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela, so she made 10% of $800 which is $80 less. That means Julieta made $800 - $80 = $720.

Together they made $800 + $720 = $1520.


$1520 

"
"Okay, so Jennifer starts with 12 oranges. She gives 2 each to her three daughters, that's 3 daughters * 2 oranges/daughter = 6 oranges. Then she gives her son 3 oranges.  In total, she gave away 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.  That means she has 12 - 9 = 3 oranges left. 


3 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Claire gets 1 badge a month. Amber takes twice as long, so she gets 1 badge every 2 months, meaning she gets 6 badges in a year (12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges).

Wendy gets 3 times as many badges as Claire, so she gets 3 badges a month and 36 in a year (3 badges/month * 12 months = 36 badges).

That means Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year (36 badges - 6 badges = 30 badges).


30 

"
"Okay, so Paige bakes for 5 hours and makes 2 loaves each hour, that's 5 * 2 = 10 loaves.  Each loaf has 8 slices, so she has 10 * 8 = 80 slices to sell. If each slice sells for 50 cents, she makes 80 * $0.50 = $40.00. 


$40.00
"
"Okay, so Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, and we know she has 70 gold coins.  That means she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.  

To find the total, we add the gold and silver coins: 70 + 40 = 110 coins.


110 

"
"Okay, so Mr. George had 600 burritos.  The students ate 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.  Then Mr. George ate 20, for a total of 500 + 20 = 520 burritos eaten. That means there were 600 - 520 = 80 burritos left over.


80 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  They have 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars, so that's 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. They have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, meaning they have 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.

That's a total of 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 red, green, and blue cars. Since they have 75 cars total, they must have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars. 


23 

"
"Okay, so let's break this down.  

We know all three girls have 85 books total. Let's say Fawn has 'F' number of books. Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn, so she has F - 12 books. Sofie has 25 more than Anne, meaning she has (F - 12) + 25 books, which simplifies to F + 13 books.

To find out how many books Fawn has, we can add up all the books and set it equal to 85:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Combining like terms, we get:

3F + 1 = 85

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3F = 84

Finally, dividing both sides by 3:

F = 28


So Fawn has 28 books. 

"
"Okay, so Daisy's potatoes weigh 5 pounds. Her sweet potatoes weigh twice that, so they're 5 * 2 = 10 pounds.  The carrots weigh 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, meaning they weigh 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. 


7 

"
"Okay, so Greg needs enough jello for 30 kids to each have 4 cups, which is 30 * 4 = 120 cups.  Each box makes 10 cups, so he'll need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello. If each box costs $1.25, then he'll spend 12 * $1.25 = $15.00 on jello. 


$15.00 

"
"Okay, so the phones cost $700 each, and he bought 5, so that's 700 * 5 = $3500.  If he paid with $4000, his change would be $4000 - $3500 = $500.


$500 

"
"Okay, so Madeline pays for most of the groceries, right?  If they spend $400 a month and she pays 60%, that means she pays $240.  That leaves $160 for Keenan to pay.  Since there are four weeks in a month, Keenan spends $160 / 4 = $40 per week.


$40 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* **Day 1:** Tobias ate 2/5 of the pizza, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 pieces.
* **Day 2:** He ate another 10 pieces.
* **Day 3:**  After the first two days, he had 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces left. He ate 7/13 of those, which is (7/13) * 26 = 14 pieces.

In total, Tobias ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces of pizza.


48 

"
"Okay, so we need to figure out how much David has to pay.  

First, let's see how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles cost $21, then one bottle costs $21 / 7 = $3.

One bottle of water costs $8 / 4 = $2.

So, 3 bottles of soda will cost 3 * $3 = $9.

And 2 bottles of water will cost 2 * $2 = $4.

In total, David will pay $9 + $4 = $13.00. 


$13.00
"
"Okay, so David starts with $12.48.  Each bolt costs $0.03, and he's buying 16, so that's 16 * $0.03 = $0.48 for all the bolts.  If he spends $0.48, he'll have $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00 left.


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Ella makes $33 for every 3 hours of dog walking.  To figure out how much she'd make in 12 hours, we need to see how much she makes per hour.  

If she makes $33 for 3 hours, that means she makes $33 / 3 = $11 per hour.

Now, to find out how much she'd make in 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12: $11/hour * 12 hours = $132.


$132 

"
"Okay, so Paul starts with 52 marbles and gets 28 more, that's 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  But then he loses a quarter of them. A quarter of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20 marbles.  So he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.


60 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

So Amy gets 80% of the multiple choice right, which is 10 questions * 0.80 = 8 questions right.  Each of those is worth a point, so that's 8 points.

For the true/false, she gets 90% right, so that's 20 questions * 0.90 = 18 questions right. Those are also worth 1 point each, so that's another 18 points.

The long answer is trickier. She gets 60% of those right, which is 5 questions * 0.60 = 3 questions right.  Each of those is worth 5 points, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 points.

Adding it all up, she gets 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.


41 

"
"Okay, so Isaias wants to make $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens.

That means he'll make 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000 from selling them.

Since he wants to make $2000 profit, that means he bought the chickens for $9000 - $2000 = $7000.


$7000 

"
"Okay, so Julie sold 14 glasses.  Micah and Mitchell sold the rest, which is 32 total glasses - 14 glasses = 18 glasses.

Since they sold the same amount, each boy sold 18 glasses / 2 boys = 9 glasses.

Julie sold 14 glasses - 9 glasses = 5 more glasses than Micah. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Iris spent $400 on her hair. Her manicure cost 1/4 of that, which is $400 / 4 = $100.  Her pedicure cost 3/4 the price of her manicure, so that's $100 * (3/4) = $75.

To find the total, we add up all the costs: $400 + $100 + $75 = $575.


$575 

"
"Okay, so Sarah makes $2 for every meter of rope she sells, and she has 20 meters. That means she'll earn 20 * $2 = $40.  

The new rope costs $1.50 per meter, and she wants 20 meters, so that's 20 * $1.50 = $30.

If she earns $40 and spends $30, she'll have $40 - $30 = $10 left over. 


$10
"
"Okay, so Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, which means she's 8 years old now.  If we want to know when she'll be three times her current age, that's 8 * 3 = 24 years old.  

So, she needs 24 - 8 = 16 more years.


16 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

The bacon costs $10 for 5 packs, so each pack is $2.  The chicken costs twice as much as the bacon, so each pack is $4.  Since she has 6 packs of chicken, that's $4 * 6 = $24.

The strawberries are $4 each, and she has 3 packs, so that's $4 * 3 = $12. The apples are half the price of the strawberries, so they're $4 / 2 = $2 each. She has 7 packs of apples, so that's $2 * 7 = $14.

Adding it all up: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

If her budget is $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left. 


$5
"
"Okay, so Elaina's final concert is double the length of her normal ones, plus an extra 15 minutes for the encore.  We know the whole thing is 65 minutes long.  

If we take away the encore time, the double-length concert is 65 - 15 = 50 minutes.

That means her regular concerts are 50 / 2 = 25 minutes long. 


25
"
"Let's see... Argo started with 200 toys and gave away 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.  That means he has 200 - 150 = 50 toys left.


50 

"
"Okay, so they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, that's 125 + 125 = 250 chimichangas.

Then on Friday they make double the amount from Tuesday, so that's 125 * 2 = 250 chimichangas.

In total, they make 250 + 250 = 500 chimichangas. 


500 

"
"Okay, so the singer has 50 microphones, but 20% of them can't fit. That means 50 * 0.20 = 10 microphones won't fit.  

That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 microphones that can be paired up. Since each pair needs 2 microphones, he can make 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.


20 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. 

Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Then he sees 2/3 of that amount flying, which is (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds.  He also sees 3 groups of 8 birds eating, so that's 3 * 8 = 24 birds.

Adding all those up: 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds. 


34 

"
"Okay, so Lani starts with 55 cookies and eats 5, leaving her with 50.  Then she splits those 50 cookies evenly between 5 jars. That means each jar gets 10 cookies. 


10
"
"Okay, so Joelle's orchids have a total of 25 petals (5 orchids * 5 petals each). Her daisies have 40 petals (4 daisies * 10 petals each).  That means the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids (40 - 25 = 15).


15 

"
"Okay, so Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are inside, which is 25 plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants left (100 - 25 = 75).  Two-thirds of those are outside, so that's 50 plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).  That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

So, 25 out of 100 plants are flowering, which is 25%. 


25%
"
"Okay, so a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and we know the whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.  That means the thingamabob spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

The whirligig is 5 times faster than the thingamabob, so it spins at 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second.


55 

"
"Okay, so Ellen spends $6 on salad and the yogurt is half that price, so the yogurt costs $3.  That means the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.  

Since her total spending is $11, she spends $11 - $9 = $2 on carrots. Because she buys two carrots, each carrot must cost $2 / 2 = $1. 


$1 

"
"Okay, so Mark works 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, which is 40 hours total. His raise bumped him up to $12 an hour.  To find out his weekly earnings, you multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours he works in a week: $12/hour * 40 hours/week = $480/week.


$480 

"
"This problem is a bit tricky!  We know Tasha made $80 total, but we don't know how much of that was from mowing.  

She mowed Joe's lawn some number of times, let's call that number ""x"".  Then she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times that amount (3x) and Alba's lawn 5 times that amount (5x).

Since Joe paid her $6 each time, she made $6 times x dollars from his lawn. Kamala paid her $18x and Alba paid her $30x.

To figure out how much she made from lemonade, we'd need to know how many times she mowed Joe's lawn (that ""x"" value).  Then we could add up all her mowing money and subtract it from her total earnings of $80. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Martin weighs 55 kg, and Carl is 16 kg heavier, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.

Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, meaning Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.

Finally, Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.


74 

"
"Okay, so John makes $25 for every hour he rents his car. He rents it out 10 times a month, and each rental is for 3 hours.  So that's 10 * 3 = 30 hours of rental time.

He earns 30 hours * $25/hour = $750 each month.

But he has to pay $500 for the car, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.


$250 

"
"Okay, so Martha ended up with 7 notebooks after buying more.  Before buying more, she had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.

Joseph had 3 times that amount, meaning he had 2 * 3 = 6 notebooks.

Martha now has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph. 


1 

"
"Okay, so Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 more than that, which is 50 / 5 = 10 extra miles.  That means Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Together they rowed 50 + 60 = 110 miles. 


110 

"
"Okay, so Susan starts with 100 cookies but her husband eats 4, leaving 96.  Then she splits those between her 6 nephews. That means each nephew gets 96 divided by 6, which is 16 cookies. 


16
"
"Okay, so Denise read 10 pages yesterday and then 13 + 5 = 18 pages today. That's a total of 10 + 18 = 28 pages for Denise.

Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and zero today, for a total of 13 pages.

Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 more pages than Daniel.


15 

"
"Okay, so Calvin has enough soup for four adult bowls or eight kid bowls.  He, his wife, and their two kids will eat four bowls total. That leaves four bowls leftover. Since there are two kids, each kid can have two bowls of soup for lunch. 


2 

"
"Okay, so William bought 5 notebooks at $1.50 each, so that's 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.  Then he also got a ballpen for $0.50.  Adding those together, he spent $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00.


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Jo needs to figure out how much material she needs for both the small and large masks. 

For the small masks, she uses 2 yards of material for every 4 masks. That means each small mask needs 2/4 = 0.5 yards of material. Since she wants to make 20 small masks, she'll need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.

For the large masks, she uses 2.25 yards for every 3 masks.  Each large mask needs 2.25/3 = 0.75 yards of material. For 8 large masks, she'll need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.

In total, she'll need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.


16 

"
"Okay, so Deepa saw 9 movies three times each, that's 9 * 3 = 27 times in total.  

If she spent $216, then each ticket cost $216 / 27 = $8. 


$8
"
"Okay, so Harold sleeps for 10 hours and works 2 hours less than that, which is 8 hours. He also spends an hour walking his dog.  That's a total of 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.  Since there are 24 hours in a day, he has 24 - 19 = 5 hours of free time left. 

5 

"
"Okay, so Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes, that's a total of 16. He uses 3 blue boxes for fishing, leaving him with 4 blue boxes. He also uses 1/3 of his red boxes, which is 3 red boxes (9 / 3 = 3). That means he has 6 red boxes left.  

So, in total, he has 4 blue + 6 red = 10 shoeboxes left. 


10 

"
"Okay, so Joseph started with twice the number of books Sarah had, which is 9 * 2 = 18 books.  But then he lost 2, so he has 18 - 2 = 16 books left. 


16
"
"Okay, so Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives 6 to Jamie (since 30 divided by 5 is 6) and then another 10 to Donald.  That means he gave away a total of 16 marbles.  If he started with 30 and gave away 16, he has 14 left.


14 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Duncan is 60 now, so eight years ago he was 52.  The problem says that back then, his age was double Adam's age four years ago.  So, Adam was 26 four years ago (52 / 2 = 26). That means Adam is currently 30 years old (26 + 4 = 30).

In eight years, Adam will be 38 (30 + 8 = 38).


38 

"
"Okay, so Farmer Brown has 200 acres. Farmer Smith has twice that amount plus 100 more, so that's (200 * 2) + 100 = 500 acres.  

Together they have 200 + 500 = 700 acres. 


700 

"
"Okay, so Colby makes 20 cents for each package. He does 10 less than 50 an hour, so that's 40 packages.  That means he makes 40 times 20 cents, which is $8.00 every hour.  If he works 8 hours, he makes $8.00 times 8, which is $64.00.


$64.00 

"
"Okay, so an extreme Sudoku takes four times longer than a normal one, which is 45 minutes. That means it takes 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.

He drinks a bottle every 30 minutes, so in 180 minutes he drinks 180 / 30 = 6 bottles. 


6 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Benny used 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon and he had 20 red balloons, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna right there.  That leaves 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna for the yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, there must have been 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.


6 

"
"Okay, so Jon drives 100 miles a day, and he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  If he drives for a whole month of 30 days, that's 100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles.

Since he needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, he'll need 3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups. 


3 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday, he doubles that, so he works 5 * 2 = 10 hours. Then on Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, meaning he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.

To find the total, we add up the hours for all three days: 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours.


23 

"
"Okay, so Julia and Nadine pooled their money together.  They spent $11 on a cake, $3 on balloons (since a dozen balloons is 12, and they cost $0.50 for 2), and $14 on ice cream (2 tubs at $7 each). That means they spent a total of $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they split the cost evenly, their mom gave each of them $28 / 2 = $14. 


$14
"
"Okay, so Kira has 3 apples + 5 bananas + 6 oranges = 14 pieces of fruit.  If Lola eats 2, there are 14 - 2 = 12 pieces left. 


12
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  There are 6 tennis players and double that number playing volleyball, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 volleyball players. That means there are 6 + 12 = 18 students playing tennis or volleyball.  

Adding the soccer players, we get a total of 18 + 16 + 22 = 56 students.


56 

"
"Okay, so they sold 30 lollipops per student times 30 students, that's 900 lollipops total.  If they sold each one for 80 cents, that's 900 times $0.80, which is $720.  But they spent 50 cents each on the lollipops, so that's 900 times $0.50, or $450.  

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: $720 - $450 = $270.


$270 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Larry has a lot of pets!

* He starts with 3 cats.
* He has 3 times that many dogs, so 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.
* He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, meaning he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
* He has three times as many fish as rabbits, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 fish.
* Finally, he has 1/3 the number of gerbils as fish, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

To find the total, we add up all the pets: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets. 

Larry has 47 pets! 

"
"Okay, so Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice that, so he eats 4 slices a day.  Together they eat 6 slices a day.  Since there are 24 slices in the loaf, it will last them 24 / 6 = 4 days. 

4 

"
"Okay, so Martha collects shells for 5 years, from when she's 5 to when she turns 10.  Since she gets one shell each month, and there are 12 months in a year, she'd have 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 shells.


60 

"
"Okay, so Lana has 27 cups and splits them into 3 rows, meaning each row gets 9 cups (27 / 3 = 9).  Since she wants the same amount of chamomile and mint in each row, she'd have 4.5 cups of each (9 / 2 = 4.5).


4.5 

"
"Okay, so the sloth takes 4 hours for each round trip to get berries.  If he has 8 hours, he can make 8 hours / 4 hours/trip = 2 trips.  To get 24 berries in 2 trips, he needs to grab 24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries each time he goes down.


12 

"
"Okay, so the pool has 10000 gallons, and they use half of that to fill the tank, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.  Then they use 500 gallons each day for 6 days, so that's 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons used up.  That means they have 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons left in the tank.


2000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Colby's got $150 for movies this month.  He already spent some on tickets and snacks, so we need to see how much he has left.

* Friday/Saturday movies cost $10 each, and he saw 5, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.
* Other day movies are $7 each, and he saw 8, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.
* Popcorn is $8 a tub, and he had 2, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.
* Candy is $2 a box, and he got 4, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Adding all that up, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

That means he has $150 - $130 = $20 left.

A Friday movie, popcorn, and candy cost $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

So, he can see **1** more movie tonight. 



"
"Okay, so Andrew made a bunch of mini pastries.  Let's figure out the calories.

A regular cinnamon roll has 600 calories, but a mini one is only 1/3 of that, so it has 600 / 3 = 200 calories.

A regular blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

He made 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so that's 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

He made 300 mini blueberry muffins, so that's 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

In total, all the pastries have 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.


85000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* On Tuesday and Wednesday, Rita removed 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs each day.
* That's a total of 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs for those two days.
* For the whole week, she removed 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.
* To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.


60 

"
"Okay, so the bus traveled for 5 hours at 60 miles per hour, so it went 5 * 60 = 300 miles. The car traveled for 8 hours at 30 miles per hour, meaning it went 8 * 30 = 240 miles.  The bus went 300 - 240 = 60 miles farther than the car.


60 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Sophie has 31 blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 rings = 48 toys already.  Since she has 62 toys total, that means she has 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls. 


14
"
"Okay, so we need to figure out Peter's age.  

We know that Peter, Paul, and John's ages all add up to 100. We also know Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

Let's think about it this way:

* If Paul is 10 years older than John, we can think of their ages like this: John's age + 10 = Paul's age.

* Peter's age is John's age + Paul's age, so it's like adding John's age + (John's age + 10). That means Peter's age is 2 times John's age plus 10.

*  We know all three ages add up to 100, so we can write an equation: 2 times John's age + 10 + John's age + Paul's age = 100

* Since Paul's age is John's age + 10, we can substitute that in: 2 times John's age + 10 + John's age + (John's age + 10) = 100

* Now we can simplify and solve for John's age: 4 times John's age + 20 = 100

* Subtract 20 from both sides: 4 times John's age = 80

* Divide both sides by 4: John's age = 20

* Now that we know John is 20, we can find Peter's age: 2 times John's age + 10 = 2 times 20 + 10 = 50



So Peter is 50 years old. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Maria's friends start with 2 balloons each, and there are 4 friends, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 balloons. Maria has 1 balloon.  So they have a total of 8 + 1 = 9 balloons at first. Then her mom gives everyone 3 more, so that's 5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 more balloons.  Adding those to the starting amount, they have 9 + 15 = 24 balloons.


24 

"
"Okay, so they have a bunch of stuff to sell. Let's see... 10 people donated 5 boxes each, so that's 50 boxes right there. Plus, they already had 10 boxes, making a total of 60 boxes.  If each table holds 2 boxes, they'll need 30 tables in total. Since they already have 15, they need to get 15 more.


15 

"
"Okay, so Zoey spits 40 seeds at 10 feet each, that's 400 feet total. Sydney spits 35 seeds at 12 feet each, so she spits 420 feet.  To find the average, you add those together (400 + 420 = 820) and then divide by 2 because there are two people. 820 divided by 2 is 410.

410 

"
"Okay, so Fern wants to make the most money, right?  

The Widgeteer 3000 makes way more widgets - 60 an hour compared to the WidgetMaster 9000's 45. If it runs all day every day for a month, that's a lot of extra widgets!  

Let's see... 60 widgets an hour times 24 hours is 1440 widgets a day. That's 43200 widgets in a month! The other one only makes 32400.

Since each widget sells for $6, Fern would make $259200 with the Widgeteer 3000 and $194400 with the WidgetMaster 9000.

That means she'd make $64800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.


64800 

"
"Okay, so Cameron stays for 17 hours total. The hotel charges 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours, and then 70 pesos for each extra hour.  

So, he needs to pay for 5 extra hours (17 - 12 = 5). That's 5 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 350 pesos.

Adding that to the initial 1000 pesos, his total cost is 1350 pesos.

A 24-hour stay would have cost him 1600 pesos.

That means he saved 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos!


250 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Each goat eats 5 pounds of hay. Since there are 15 goats, that's 15 * 5 = 75 pounds of hay for the goats.

Sheep eat a bit less. They eat 2 times the amount a goat eats (2 * 5 = 10 pounds) minus 3 pounds, so they eat 7 pounds each. With 12 sheep, that's 12 * 7 = 84 pounds of hay for the sheep.

In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay. 


159 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. John makes $50 an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = $300.  

He spends $50 on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = $250 left.

Then he buys 5 pencils at $10 each, which costs him 5 * 10 = $50. Now he has 250 - 50 = $200.

He wants to put $100 in the bank, leaving him with 200 - 100 = $100.

Finally, he can buy $100 / $25 per pen = 4 pens. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Craig spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, that's 20 * 15 = 300 letters. His brother spelled words with 50 more letters than that, so he spelled 300 + 50 = 350 letters worth of words.  

To find the total, we add Craig's letters and his brother's letters: 300 + 350 = 650 letters.


650 

"
"Okay, so there are 8 kids in each row, and 7 rows for each school. That means each school has 8 * 7 = 56 kids.  Since there are 5 schools, there are a total of 56 * 5 = 280 kids. 

280 

"
"Okay, so the teacher has 9 coupons and each one gets her 100 bottles of juice, so that's 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.  Then she gives each of her 29 students 2 bottles, which is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.  That means she has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles left for herself.


842 

"
"Okay, so Patty charges $40 just to come to your house. Then she charges $35 for every hour she works, even if she doesn't work a full hour.  This job took her 2.25 hours, so that's 2.25 times $35, which is $78.75.  Plus, she used $60 in parts.  

So, the total is $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75 



"
"Okay, so James got 10 CDs at $15 each, so that's 10 * $15 = $150.  But they were 40% off, so he saved $150 * 0.40 = $60. That means he paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

Then he sold 5 of them for $40 each, so he made 5 * $40 = $200.

So, he ended up with $200 - $90 = $110.


$110 

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Jen will make. 

She's got 6 yams at $1.50 each, so that's 6 * $1.50 = $9.00.

Her sweet potatoes are $2.00 each, and she has 10, so that's 10 * $2.00 = $20.00.

Finally, her carrots are $1.25 each, and she has 4, meaning she'll make 4 * $1.25 = $5.00 from those.

Adding it all up: $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00


$34.00
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 12 miles.  Since he swims at 2 miles per hour, that first part takes him 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours.

He then rests for half that time, so 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours of rest.

He has 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles left to go. But now he's swimming slower, at 1 mile per hour (half his original speed). So that last part takes him 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours.

Adding it all up: 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.


17 

"
"Okay, so the bakery has 40 less than seven times the number of loaves Sam had.  Sam had 70 loaves, and seven times that is 7 * 70 = 490.  Then we subtract 40: 490 - 40 = 450.

The bakery has 450 loaves of bread. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Jasmine starts with 15 stickers, loses 7, and then gets 5 more.  

So, 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.

Then 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

She has 13 stickers at the end. 

"
"Okay, so Cayley gets 10% of the $5 price for each New York Times, which is 50 cents.  He sells 6 of those, so that's 6 times 50 cents, or $3.00.

For the Wall Street Journal, he makes 8% of $15, which is $1.20 per paper. He sells 10 of those, so that's $1.20 times 10, which is $12.00.

Adding those together, he makes $3.00 + $12.00 = $15.00 in total commission.


$15.00
"
"Okay, so Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, making him 21.  Marcus is half Leo's age, so Leo must be twice Marcus's age. That means Leo is 21 * 2 = 42 years old. 


42 

"
"Okay, so Bahati scored the most points, and we know the total is 45.  Let's think about it this way:

* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar. That means Azibo scored less than Bahati, and Dinar scored even less.

* Since we need to find Azibo's score, let's say Azibo scored 'x' points.

* Bahati scored x + 20 points.

* Dinar scored x + 10 points.

*  If we add all their scores together, it should equal 45: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

* Combining like terms: 3x + 30 = 45

* Subtracting 30 from both sides: 3x = 15

* Dividing both sides by 3: x = 5


So Azibo scored 5 points. 

"
"Okay, so the book is 1.5 inches thick and each inch has 100 pages.  That means there are 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages in the book. 


150 

"
"Okay, so Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he works for 15 hours total (from 8 am to 11 pm). That means he staples for 900 minutes (15 hours * 60 minutes/hour).  

If he staples for 15 minutes at a time, he does that 60 times (900 minutes / 15 minutes/time).  

So, he staples a total of 1800 reports (60 times * 30 reports/time).


1800 

"
"Okay, so Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes. She sleepwalked for 23 minutes, so we subtract that: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.  Then she woke up 5 minutes early, so we subtract that too: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

452 

"
"Okay, so Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups. He has 2/3 that many spoons, so he has (2/3) * 24 = 16 spoons.  After giving 6 to Pedro, he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.  

In total, he has 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils. 


34 

"
"Okay, so the hospital starts with 1000 beds and 1/5 are full, which is 200 beds. That means 800 beds are empty.

Then they get 50 new patients every day for two weeks, which is 14 days. So that's 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

Now there are 200 + 700 = 900 patients in the hospital.

That leaves 1000 - 900 = 100 empty beds. 


100
"
"Okay, so Robyn sends 16 emails a day.  Seven are for work, so that leaves 9 emails for family and her boyfriend.  Two-thirds of those 9 emails go to family, which is 6 emails. That means 3 emails are left for her boyfriend. 


3 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Aliya is 3 years old, and Shawna is three times her age, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old. Shawna's dad is five times older than her, meaning he's 5 * 9 = 45 years old. 


45 

"
"Okay, so Courtney said there were 48 people, but she overestimated by 20%.  That means we need to figure out what 20% of 48 is and subtract it from her number.

20% of 48 is like doing (20/100) * 48 = 9.6.

So, we take 9.6 away from 48: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

Since you can't have part of a person, we round down. 

38 

"
"Okay, so Jason carried 2 balls.  Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, meaning Jeffrey carried 2 / 2 = 1 ball. Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, so he carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.  In total, they carried 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls. 


7 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. They dug a bunch of holes over three days, then filled in two.  The island ended up with four times as many holes as they had at the end of the first day.  

So, if we work backwards, they had 29 holes before filling any in (since they filled in 2). That means they must have had 7 holes at the end of the first day (because 29 divided by 4 is 7.25, but you can't have part of a hole).

That means they dug 22 holes on the fourth day (29 total holes - 7 holes from day one = 22).


22 

"
"Okay, so Amora and Lainey each got 70 chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, meaning Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 chips.


225 

"
"Okay, so Jen's supplies cost $400. His travel tickets cost 50% more than that, which means they cost an extra $400 * 0.50 = $200.  

So, his travel costs are $400 + $200 = $600.


$600
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon. Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount, so Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon. Alex caught 5 more than Stan, meaning he caught 4A - 13 + 5, or 4A - 8 Pokemon.

All together they caught 339, so A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339.

Combining like terms, we get 9A - 21 = 339.

Adding 21 to both sides gives us 9A = 360.

Dividing both sides by 9, we find that A = 40.

Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon, so he caught 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.


**Answer:** 147 

"
"Okay, so each episode is 20 minutes long.  And there are only half as many episodes as minutes in each episode, meaning there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.

If he watches all 10 episodes, that's 10 * 20 = 200 minutes of TV time. 


200 

"
"Okay, so the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 miles.

Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 2 * 18 = 36 miles.

Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between the homes, we need to add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.


374 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Greta starts with 12 brownies, gets 6 more from work, and her friends bring 48. That's a total of 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.  They eat 18 brownies at the party, so she has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.


48 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Nani's brother is twice his age, so he's 8 * 2 = 16 years old. Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she's 8 * 0.25 = 2 years younger. That makes her 8 - 2 = 6 years old.  

To find the total age, we add up their ages: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years.


30 

"
"Okay, so Andy has a bunch of racquets to restring. Let's see...

* He's got 3 with synthetic gut, and those take 15 minutes each, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 minutes.
* Then there are 5 with polyester, which take 22 minutes each, so that's 5 * 22 = 110 minutes.
* Finally, the 4 hybrid ones take 18 minutes each, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Adding all that up, it takes him 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes to string all the racquets. 


227
"
"Okay, so John buys two phones at full price, which is $600 each, so that's $600 * 2 = $1200.  The other two phones are half price, so they're $600 / 2 = $300 each.  That means those two cost $300 * 2 = $600.  

Adding it all up, he spent $1200 + $600 = $1800 on phones.


$1800 

"
"Okay, so Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, which has 13. That means Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.  

To find the total, we add the number of players on both teams: 20 + 13 = 33 players.


33 

"
"Okay, so Robert needs to figure out how much fencing he needs first.  Since it's a rectangle, you add up all the sides: 15 feet + 10 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet of fencing.

He needs 2 slats for every foot, so he'll need 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats. 


100 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Mrs. Harrington starts with 12 boxes of oranges. She gives away 4 boxes (2 to her mom and 2 to her sister), leaving her with 8 boxes. She keeps a quarter of those, which is 2 boxes. That means she sold 6 boxes (8 - 2 = 6). Since each box has 20 oranges, she sold a total of 120 oranges (6 * 20 = 120).


120 

"
"Okay, so the USA has 50 states.  Half of that is 25. India has 4 more than that, so they have 29 states.  If you add those together, there are a total of 79 states in both countries. 


79 

"
"Okay, so Tyler needs to figure out how much money he needs in total. The dictionary is $18, the dinosaur book is $13, and the cookbook is $8. That means the books cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

He already has $14 saved, so he still needs $39 - $14 = $25.

If he makes $5 an hour, he needs to work $25 / $5 = 5 hours. 


5 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Robert has 30 cherries and that's 10 more than Richard, so Richard has 20 cherries. Together they have 50 cherries (30 + 20), which means Jerry has 10 cherries (60 - 50).  

Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry (30 - 10).


20 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* **Saturday:** Sunny sold 10 gingerbread and 6 apple pies (10 - 4 = 6).
* **Saturday earnings:** Gingerbread: 10 * $6 = $60. Apple pie: 6 * $15 = $90. Total: $60 + $90 = $150.
* **Sunday:** He sold 15 gingerbread (10 + 5 = 15) and 15 apple pies.
* **Sunday earnings:** Gingerbread: 15 * $6 = $90. Apple pie: 15 * $15 = $225. Total: $90 + $225 = $315.
* **Total for both days:** $150 + $315 = $465


$465
"
"Okay, so Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She's out for 4 hours a day, so that's 4 ounces a day. Over 8 days, she'll need 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces of sunscreen.  Since each bottle has 8 ounces, she'll need 32 ounces / 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles. 

4 

"
"Okay, so the blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper, which means it costs 60% of the blue car's price.  60% of $100 is $60.  

So the red car costs $60.  Together they cost $100 + $60 = $160.


$160 

"
"Okay, so Emil is 19 now.  In five years, he'll be 24.  At that time, his dad will be twice his age, so his dad will be 48.  Since Emil will be twice his brother's age then, his brother will be 12.

That means Emil's dad is currently 43 (48 - 5) and his brother is 7 (12 - 5).

Adding those together, the dad and brother's ages total 50. 


50
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Adrianne's mom gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend doubled her mom's amount, meaning she got 20 * 2 = 40 beads.  

To find the total, we add up all the beads: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.


90 

"
"Okay, so Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday. On Friday, he caught four times that, which is 3 * 4 = 12 pounds. Then on Saturday, he caught half of what he caught on Friday, so that's 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.

In total, he has 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish. Since each serving is 3 pounds, he has 21 / 3 = 7 servings. 


7 

"
"Okay, so 20% of the class are football players, which is 30 * 0.20 = 6 students.  That leaves 30 - 6 = 24 students.

Then 25% of those remaining students are cheerleaders or in band, so that's 24 * 0.25 = 6 students.

In total, 6 + 6 = 12 students are leaving early. 


12
"
"Okay, so Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's size 5 boots. That means Charlie wears a size 25!  To find the average, we add their sizes together (5 + 25 = 30) and then divide by 2 because there are two people. 30 divided by 2 is 15.


15 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how many plants will fit in Pat's flower bed. It's 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches (111 x 12). Each plant needs 12 inches of space plus 18 inches between plants, so that's 30 inches per plant.  

Pat can fit 44 plants in her bed (1332 / 30). She already has 17, so she needs to buy 27 more (44 - 17).

Each plant costs $6, so she'll spend $162 in total (27 x 6). 



"
"Okay, so Edgar's brother eats half the amount Edgar does, which is 18 pretzels / 2 = 9 pretzels a day.  

To find out how many he eats in a week, we multiply that by 7: 9 pretzels/day * 7 days/week = 63 pretzels.


63 

"
"Okay, so Katherine needs 3 petunias at $3 each, which is 3 * $3 = $9. She also needs 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each, so that's 2 * $2.50 = $5.  

That means each basket costs $9 + $5 = $14 to fill. Since she has 5 baskets, the total cost is $14 * 5 = $70. 


$70.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  They use 12 pounds of soil for the sunflowers (4 sunflowers * 3 pounds each) and 15 pounds for the carnations (10 carnations * 1.5 pounds each). That's a total of 27 pounds.  They started with 30 pounds, so they have 3 pounds left for roses (30 - 27 = 3). Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 roses.

"Okay, so Jessica saves 25% of her $2000 paycheck, which is $500 every month.  That means she saves $6000 a year ($500 x 12 months). Since each pair of shoes costs $1000, she can buy 6 pairs of shoes.

"
"Okay, so Emily peels 6 shrimp every minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, that's 90 / 6 = 15 minutes.  She cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, so for 90 shrimp it would take her 3 times as long, which is 30 minutes.  

In total, it would take her 15 minutes for peeling plus 30 minutes for cooking, for a grand total of 45 minutes.

"
"Okay, so the AC cools the room down, but it also warms up a bit when it's off. Let's see...

* On low, it cools 2 degrees each hour for 3 hours, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 degrees cooler.
* Then on high, it cools 3 degrees each hour for 4 hours, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 degrees cooler.
* That's a total of 6 + 12 = 18 degrees cooler.
* But then it warms up 2 degrees each hour for 2 hours, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 degrees warmer.
* So overall, the room is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees cooler than it started.

"
"Okay, so Comet Halley comes around every 75 years. Bill's dad saw it when he was 30.  Bill saw it when he was three times his dad's age then, which is 3 * 30 = 90 years old.  That means 90 / 75 = 1.2 comet cycles happened. So, Bill was 75 years old when he first saw it.


75 

"
"Okay, let's see... Buford pays his electric and gas bills once a month, so that's 12 checks for each of those. He gives to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year (2 x 12). And the pest control comes quarterly, which is four times a year.  

So, adding those up: 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks. 


52
"
"Okay, so the second plane takes 44 trips, and that's only half the number the first plane takes. That means the first plane takes 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

It flies to Greece for three-quarters of those, so that's 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights to Greece.

That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.

Since those are split evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France. 


11
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice that, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 seconds. Igneous howls for the combined time of the other two, meaning he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

To get the total time, we add up all their howl times: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, they howl for a total of 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.


2 

"
"Okay, so Adam's dad gave him twice the amount his mom did, which is $6 * 2 = $12.

That means his parents gave him a total of $6 + $12 = $18.

Since the trousers cost $30, Adam had to pay $30 - $18 = $12 from his own savings. 


$12
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

We know the total age of all four kids is 20. Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so together they are 3 + 4 = 7 years old.

Helene is twice the average age of the group. Since there are four kids, the average age is 20 / 4 = 5 years old. That means Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

So far, Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene are 7 + 10 = 17 years old.

That means Wilfred must be 20 - 17 = 3 years old.

"
"Okay, so Walter gets $500 from his neighbors and $1500 online, that's a total of $2000. His lawyer is going to give three times that amount, so that's $2000 * 3 = $6000.  

$6000 

"
"Okay, so there were 100 guests and each brought 15 cookies, that's 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies total.  The bride gave half of those to the church, so that's 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies. If each person at the church got 15 cookies, then there were 750 / 15 = 50 people at the church.


50 

"
"Okay, so there are 2 adults and 4 kids, and each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid.  

Think of it like this: if each kid got one ""unit"" of watermelon, each adult would get two ""units"". That means the adults get 2 units each, and the kids get 1 unit each.

So, in total, that's 2 adults * 2 units/adult + 4 kids * 1 unit/kid = 4 + 4 = 8 units of watermelon.

Since each adult gets 2 units out of 8, they each get 2/8 * 100% = 25% of the watermelon.


**Answer:** 25 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic.  He spends 20 minutes per patient on rounds, and he has 9 patients, so that's 20 * 9 = 180 minutes on rounds.  That's 180 / 60 = 3 hours.

His appointments take 30 minutes each, and he has 10, so that's 30 * 10 = 300 minutes, or 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

In total, he spends 3 + 5 = 8 hours on rounds and appointments.

That leaves him with 9 - 8 = 1 hour for records.

"
"Okay, so Jordan needs to figure out when to start baking to have the cake ready by 5:00 pm. 

Let's see, making the batter takes 20 minutes, baking takes 30 minutes, cooling takes 2 hours (which is 120 minutes), and frosting takes 10 minutes.  

That's a total of 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.

180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.

So, she needs to start baking 3 hours before 5:00 pm, which would be 2:00 pm. 


2:00 pm
"
"Okay, so they sold a total of 8 boxes (3.5 + 4.5).  Since they sold 64 chocolate bars all together, there must be 8 chocolate bars in each box (64 / 8 = 8). 


8 

"
"Okay, so they charge $25 just to use the studio, and then $1.50 for each student. With 10 students, that's $1.50 x 10 = $15 extra per session.

So each session costs $25 + $15 = $40.

They have classes 3 times a week, so that's $40 x 3 = $120 per week.

In a month, that's $120 x 4 = $480. 


$480
"
"Okay, so Peter has 64 chocolate bars split evenly into 4 boxes, meaning he has 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each box. Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so she has 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars per box.  That means Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.


8 

"
"Okay, so there are 50 porcupines, and 3/5 of them are female. That means there are 30 female porcupines (50 * 3/5 = 30).

Each female has 4 babies a month, so that's 120 babies born each month (30 * 4 = 120).

Over a year, that's 1440 babies (120 * 12 = 1440).

Adding those babies to the original population, there would be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year (50 + 1440 = 1490).


1490 

"
"Okay, so they need to figure out how much water the pool holds, right?  

It's like a big box, so you multiply the width times the length times the depth: 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet = 1400 cubic feet.

Then they said to multiply that by 5.9 to get the gallons, so 1400 x 5.9 = 8260 gallons.

Finally, it costs $0.10 per gallon, so 8260 gallons x $0.10/gallon = $826.00 to fill it up. 


$826.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. They have 9 red sticks. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so that's 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  There are 3 fewer yellow sticks than blue sticks, meaning there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

To find the total, we add up all the sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks. 


34 

"
"Okay, so Matteo drove 55 miles per hour for 4 hours, which means he traveled 55 * 4 = 220 miles. Shandy drove 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so she traveled 45 * 10 = 450 miles.  To find out how much farther Shandy drove, we subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230 miles.


230 

"
"Okay, so half of the 3000 students are over 16, which is 1500 students.  A quarter of those are guys, so that's 375 guys over 16. That means 1125 of the students over 16 are girls.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are guys, so that's 750 guys under 16. That leaves 750 girls under 16.

Adding those together, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls at the school. 


1875
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Bethany runs 10 laps. Trey runs 4 more than that, so he runs 14 laps. Shaelyn runs half as many as Trey, which is 7 laps. Quinn runs 2 fewer than Shaelyn, so she runs 5 laps.  That means Bethany runs 5 more laps than Quinn. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Wanda and Ms. B are trying to fill this huge tank.  

On the first day, Wanda fills a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps 3/4 of what Wanda did, so she pumps 4500 gallons * 0.75 = 3375 gallons. That's a total of 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda pumps 2/3 of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B only pumps 1/3 of her day one amount, so she pumps 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons. That's 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons on the second day.

In total, they pumped 7875 gallons + 4125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

Since the tank holds 18000 gallons, they still need to pump 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.



**Answer:** 6000 

"
"Okay, so Maria's power bank was losing charge while she was using it to charge her friends' phones.  

First, it lost 9% every hour for 5 hours, so that's 9 * 5 = 45% gone.

Then it lost 7% every hour for 3 hours, which is 7 * 3 = 21% more gone.

That means in total, it lost 45 + 21 = 66% of its charge.

If it had 28% left at the end, and that's after losing 66%, it means it must have started with 28 + 66 = 94% charge.

But wait, that doesn't make sense! Power banks can't be more than 100% charged.  

Let me think... Ah, I get it! The 28% left is *after* using some charge for her friends.  

So, if 28% is what's left *after* using some, and that 28% represents 34% of the charge *after* the initial losses, then her friends used 34% - 28% = 6% of the charge.

That 6% came from the 34% that was left after the initial losses. So, to find the original charge, we can set up a proportion: 6% / 34% = x / 100%

Solving for x, we get x = (6 * 100) / 34 = 17.65% (approximately).



**Answer:** 17.65% 

"
"Okay, so Janet makes $10 an hour at her job plus another $15 an hour in tips. That's $25 an hour total! If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $1000 every week.

She needs 20% of $10,000 for a down payment, which is $2000.  

So, she'll need to save for 2 weeks to get the down payment. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Jamaar spent $1.50 on peaches, $2.00 on pears, $2.00 on kiwis, and $3.75 on apples. That's a total of $9.25.  He started with $10.00, so he has $0.75 left. Since plums cost $0.25 each, he can buy 3 plums. 



"
"Okay, so Anne has 15 packs of sweets with 60 in each pack, that's 15 * 60 = 900 sweets total. She keeps 2 packs for herself, so that's 2 * 60 = 120 sweets.  That leaves 900 - 120 = 780 sweets to give to her friends.  She has 10 friends, so each friend gets 780 / 10 = 78 sweets.


78 

"
"Okay, so the price goes up by 5% each year.  

* After one year, it'd be $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126.
* After two years, it'd be $126 + (0.05 * $126) = $132.30
* After three years, it'd be $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding that to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139 after three years. 



"
"Okay, so Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, which means each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  She has 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.  She has 2 albums of portraits, so that's 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.  In total, she has 27 + 18 = 45 portraits and selfies.


45 

"
"Okay, so James reads 3 pages every 10 minutes.  If he reads 18 pages, we need to figure out how many sets of 3 pages that is. 18 pages / 3 pages per set = 6 sets.

Since each set takes 10 minutes, he reads for a total of 6 sets * 10 minutes/set = 60 minutes.


60 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out.  

They started with 100 guests, and 24 left early, so that leaves 76. Then 15 people wanted to stay later, and twice that many, or 30, checked in later that day. So now there are 76 + 30 = 106 guests.  Finally, 7 more people checked in after dinner, bringing the total to 106 + 7 = 113 guests.


113 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

John gets 4 bananas on Wednesday, then 6 on Thursday. On Friday, he picks three times the amount he got on Wednesday, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 bananas.

To find the total, we add up all the bananas: 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 bananas.


22 

"
"Okay, so there are 60 questions total.  40% of them are easy, which is 24 questions (60 * 0.40 = 24). That leaves 36 questions that are either average or difficult. Since they're split evenly, there are 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy questions right, so that's 18 correct (24 * 0.75 = 18). She gets half of the average and difficult ones right, so that's 9 correct for each type (18 * 0.50 = 9).

Adding those up, she's sure to get 36 questions right (18 + 9 + 9 = 36).


36 

"
"Okay, so Teresa sells the big stuffed animals for three times the price of the small ones.  That means the big ones cost $12 each. She sold twice as many small ones as big ones, so let's say she sold 6 big ones. That means she sold 12 small ones.  

If she sold 6 big ones at $12 each, that's $72. If she sold 12 small ones at $4 each, that's $48.  $72 + $48 = $120, which is what she made.


12 

"
"Okay, so they eat a total of 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches each day.  

In a week, that's 11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches. 


77 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Suzanne made $80 from the cookies and $240 from the cupcakes, so that's $80 + $240 = $320 in total.  She gave her sisters $20, so she has $320 - $20 = $300 left.


$300 

"
"Okay, so the twins found 30 eggs each, which is 30 * 2 = 60 eggs total.  If 10 eggs were left over, that means their friends found 100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs. 


30 

"
"Okay, so one dwarf can mine 12 pounds a day with just his hands.  An iron pickaxe doubles that, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 pounds a day. A steel pickaxe is 50% better than the iron one, so that's 24 * 1.50 = 36 pounds a day.

If one dwarf mines 36 pounds a day, in a month (30 days) they'd mine 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds.

With 40 dwarves, that's 1080 * 40 = 43200 pounds. 


43200 

"
"Okay, so the store sells sandwiches in packs of 2 for $3 and packs of 4 for $6. That means each sandwich costs $1.50 because 6 dollars divided by 4 sandwiches is 1.50.  

If a pack has 8 sandwiches, it would cost $12.00 because 8 times 1.50 is 12. 


$12.00 

"
"Okay, so Tom's new bedroom set costs $3000, but he gets $1000 from selling his old one. That means he still owes $2000.  

If he has to pay 10% of that each month, it's $2000 times 0.10, which equals $200.


$200 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

First, Sally loses 40% of her red balloons, so she loses 25 * 0.40 = 10 red balloons. That leaves her with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

Then, she lets go of half her yellow balloons, which is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons.  She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Next, she finds 8 blue balloons and keeps 75% of them, which is 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons.

Finally, she has 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 balloons when she gets to school. 


27
"
"Okay, so there are a few ways this could go down.  There's a 50/50 shot he gets a sub, and then he's off the hook. If his regular teacher is there, there's still a 40% chance she'll give everyone more time. And even if she doesn't, Marcus is a smooth talker - he's got a 20% chance of convincing her his dog ate it!

So, let's see... 50% chance no homework, plus 40% chance of an extension, plus 20% chance of faking it... that means there's a 30% chance he actually has to turn it in. 



"
"Okay, so they have 6000 seats total, but 950 are for the graduates and 300 are for teachers. That means there are 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats left for everyone else.  If there are 950 graduates, each one would get 4750 / 950 = 5 tickets. 


5
"
"Okay, so Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans. He can eat twice that many medium beans, which is 75 * 2 = 150 medium beans.  And since 3 small beans equal one medium bean, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.


450 

"
"Okay, so Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, that's 6 * 3 = 18 hours total.

She makes $15 each day, so for 3 days she earns 15 * 3 = $45.

Parking costs $3 a day, and she parks for 3 days, so that's 3 * $3 = $9 spent on parking.

If she made $45 and spent $9, she has $45 - $9 = $36 left.

To find out how much she makes per hour after paying for parking, we divide her earnings by the number of hours: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.


$2 

"
"Okay, so Ted spent $48 on books because 3 books times $16 each is $48. He spent $18 on pencils because 3 pencils times $6 each is $18.  If you add those together, he spent a total of $66. 


66
"
"Okay, so Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide and he puts a soda bottle every 3 feet. That means he can fit 24 / 3 = 8 bottles.

He takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, so it'll take him 7 spaces * 5 seconds/space = 35 seconds to set them all up. 


35 

"
"Okay, so Uncle Franky has two boxes with 40 apples each, that's 2 * 40 = 80 apples total.  Since he puts 8 apples in each pack, he can make 80 / 8 = 10 packs. 

10 

"
"Okay, so Amor buys $22 worth of Parmesan (2 pounds x $11/pound) and $18 worth of mozzarella (3 pounds x $6/pound). That means her cheese costs a total of $40. If she started with $50, she'll have $10 left for meat. 


$10
"
"Okay, so Jim took out a lot of loans for college, $50,000 each year for four years. That's $200,000 total! Plus, he didn't make any money while he was in school, and he could have made $25,000 a year. So that's another $100,000 he missed out on.

That means he needs to earn back $300,000.  His new job pays him $75,000 a year, so it will take him 4 years to earn that much. 


4 

"
"Okay, so Jim needs the fabric to be bigger than his bed.  

His bed is 6 feet by 8 feet, and he wants it 2 feet longer and wider on each side. That means each side of the fabric will be 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 feet long and 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply the length and width: 10 feet * 12 feet = 120 square feet.


120 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* On Tuesday, they delivered 1/5 of Monday's amount plus 17 more, so that's (425 / 5) + 17 = 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

* On Wednesday, they delivered twice Tuesday's amount plus 5, meaning 2 * 102 + 5 = 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

* To find the total, we add up all three days: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.


736 

"
"Okay, so Molly has 16 people coming to the party.  10 want chicken salad at $6.50 each, so that's 10 * $6.50 = $65.00. Then 6 people want pasta salad at $6.00 each, so that's 6 * $6.00 = $36.00.  

To find the total, we add those together: $65.00 + $36.00 = $101.00


$101.00 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

His dad lost $5 on the first race. Then he won $11 on the second race (twice the amount he lost plus $1).  On the third race, he lost $16.50 (1.5 times what he won on the second race).

So, in total, he lost $5 + $16.50 = $21.50.

To find the average, we divide the total loss by the number of races: $21.50 / 3 = $7.17.


$7.17
"
"Okay, so there are 26 countries in South America, and each one has 5 cities with 1000 people in each city.  To find the total population, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of people in each country.

That's 26 countries * (5 cities/country * 1000 people/city) = 130,000 people.


130,000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to make sure we're comparing apples to apples, so let's convert Xavier's height to inches: 4 feet times 12 inches per foot is 48 inches.  

So, Xavier is now 51 inches tall (48 + 3). Cole is 52 inches tall (50 + 2).

The difference between them is 1 inch (52 - 51).

"
"Okay, so they split $1920 between three people.  The second person got $80 more than the first, and the third person got double what the second person got.  

To figure out how much the first person got, let's use some algebra. Let's say the first person got ""x"" dollars.

* The second person got x + $80.
* The third person got 2 * (x + $80) which is 2x + $160.

If we add up what everyone got, it should equal $1920:  x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Combining the 'x's and the dollar amounts: 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtract $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Finally, divide both sides by 4: x = $420


So the first person got $420. 

"
"Okay, so they worked 3/8 of a day each day, and that's like 3/8 * 24 hours, which is 9 hours.  They did that for 3 weeks, which is 21 days. So each painter worked 9 hours a day for 21 days, which is 9 * 21 = 189 hours.


189 

"
"Okay, so Rory picked up a different number of balls in each set. Let's use some algebra to figure this out.

* Let's say he got 'x' balls in the second set.
* In the first set, he got 'x + 4' balls.
* In the third set, he got 'x / 2' balls.

We know he got 19 balls total, so: (x + 4) + x + (x / 2) = 19

To solve for x:

* Combine the 'x' terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 2.5x = 15
* Divide both sides by 2.5: x = 6

So, he got 6 balls in the second set.  That means he got 6 + 4 = 10 balls in the first set.


**Answer:** 10 

"
"Okay, so the car loses 21% of its value each year.  

* In 2008, it would be worth 20000 - (0.21 * 20000) = $15800
* In 2009, it would be worth 15800 - (0.21 * 15800) = $12478
* In 2010, it would be worth 12478 - (0.21 * 12478) = $9860.62


So the answer is $9860.62

"Okay, so half the books are in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25 books.  Then 10% are in German, so that's 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.  That means there are 25 + 5 = 30 books that aren't in Spanish. So there must be 50 - 30 = 20 Spanish books.


20 

"
"Okay, so Bernice has to drive 1955 kilometers total. She already drove 325 kilometers each day for 4 days, so she drove 325 * 4 = 1300 kilometers.  

To find out how much further she needs to go, we subtract: 1955 - 1300 = 655 kilometers.


655 

"
"Okay, so Ingrid drinks 8 cups a day, and there are 16 cups in a gallon.  That means she drinks 8/16 = 0.5 gallons each day.

Over 30 days, she'd drink 0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons. 


15 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

So, the train starts with 120 people. Then 20 more get on, so there are 140.  At the next stop, 50 people get off, but 100 get on (twice the number who got off). That means there are 190 people on the train. Finally, 80 people get off at the last stop, leaving 110 people.


110 

"
"Okay, let's figure out how much Alison spent.

* Her shorts cost $5 more than her $10 tank top, so they were $15.
* Her shoes were half off from $48, making them $24.
* Her socks were $8, but she had a $2 off coupon, so they were $6.

Adding it all up: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55


$55
"
"Okay, so you need to figure out how many tiles you need for your 200 square foot kitchen. Since each tile is one square foot, you'll need 200 tiles.  

Each tile costs $12, so 200 tiles will cost 200 * $12 = $2400. 


$2400
"
"Okay, so James' insurance is 60% more expensive because of the accident. That means it's 120 + (60/100)*120 = $192 per month.  

Since there are 12 months in a year, he pays $192 * 12 = $2304 a year. 


$2304
"
"Okay, so Greg washes sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week. His washing machine can only handle 2 sets of twin sheets at once and 1 king set at a time.  

Let's see... he needs to do 4 twin beds / 2 per load = 2 loads of twin sheets. Plus, he needs to do 1 load of king sheets. That's a total of 2 + 1 = 3 loads each week.

In a year, that's 3 loads per week * 52 weeks = 156 loads. 


156 

"
"Okay, so they watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, which is 2 movies. That means they watch a total of 6 movies each weekend.  Over 4 weeks, they'd watch 6 movies/weekend * 4 weeks = 24 movies. 

24 

"
"Okay, so Leo started with 100 stickers. Last year he got 50 more, bringing his total to 150. This year he doubled his stickers from last year, so he got another 100 stickers (50 x 2 = 100).  That means he has 250 stickers now (150 + 100 = 250).


250 

"
"Okay, so Imma has three cats and feeds them 60 grams of food each, twice a day. That means she uses 3 cats * 60 grams/cat * 2 times/day = 360 grams of food per day.  If she has 720 grams of food, it will last 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days. 


2 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

They had 4 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 32 slices total.

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 fewer than Becky, so he ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as many as Jake, meaning she ate 7 * 2 = 14 slices.

Adding it all up, they ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices. 


31 

"
"Okay, so Betsy took longer than Donovan.  Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes. That means Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.  

Together they took 98 minutes, so x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combining the 'x's, we get 2x + 18 = 98.

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 40. That means Donovan took 40 minutes.

Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.


58 

"
"Okay, let's add up all the costs. The cast is $200, the doctor charges $300 an hour and she was there for 30 minutes, so that's $300 / 2 = $150.  The pills are $4 each and she got 30, so that's $4 * 30 = $120. And parking is $6 an hour for 2 hours, so that's $6 * 2 = $12.

Adding it all up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482 



"
"Okay, so James gets a ton of emails!  He gets 80 each day, but 20% of them he can just ignore. That means he has to answer 80 - (80 * 0.20) = 64 emails every day.

Over a 5 day work week, that's 64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails. 


320 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Monday had 32 classes. Tuesday had double that, so 32 x 2 = 64 classes. Wednesday had triple Monday's amount, meaning 32 x 3 = 96 classes. Thursday had 30 classes and Friday had 25.

To find the total, we add them all up: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes.


247 

"
"Okay, so to find the average, you add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.  

He got 100 three times and then an 80, so that's 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 total.

Then you divide that by 4 because there were four tests: 380 / 4 = 95

His average score was 95. 

"
"Okay, so the glee club ate a lot of pizza! They had 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, which is 14 pizzas (20 x 0.70 = 14). That leaves them with 6 pizzas.

The football team ordered double the glee club, so they had 40 pizzas (20 x 2 = 40). They ate 80% of those, which is 32 pizzas (40 x 0.80 = 32).  They have 8 pizzas left over (40 - 32 = 8).

Adding the leftovers from both teams, there are 14 pizzas left in total (6 + 8 = 14).


14 

"
"Okay, so Anthony wants to send out a lot of coupons! He's sending twice as many big coupons as small coupons, which means he's sending 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

The small coupons cost 5 cents each, so those will cost him 700 * $0.05 = $35.00. The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so those will cost 1400 * $0.15 = $210.00.

Adding those together, his total postage cost is $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00. 


$245.00
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Sidney starts with 7 meatball subs (10 - 3 = 7). That's 28 meatballs (7 * 4 = 28). Then Mark eats 4 subs, leaving Sidney with 3 (7 - 4 = 3). Those 3 subs have 12 meatballs (3 * 4 = 12).  Sidney then gets 3 more subs, for a total of 6 subs (3 + 3 = 6). That means she has 36 meatballs total (12 + (6 * 4) = 36).


36 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Hezekiah sent out 20 trucks, and each one had 20 tons of fertilizer. That's a lot of fertilizer! But then a quarter of the trucks broke down.  A quarter of 20 is 5 trucks. So, 15 trucks made it to the farmers.  

If each of those 15 trucks had 20 tons, then they delivered a total of 15 * 20 = 300 tons of fertilizer.


300 

"
"Okay, so Dennis needs 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter per dozen. That means he needs 6 pounds of butter total.

The store has a deal where you buy one pound and get another half off.  So, for every two pounds he buys, he only pays for one and a half.

Since he needs 6 pounds, he'll buy 3 full-priced pounds and get 3 half-priced.

Three pounds at $4.00 each is $12.00.

Three pounds at half price is $2.00 per pound, so that's $6.00.

In total, his butter will cost $12.00 + $6.00 = $18.00. 


$18.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how many people are coming to Kayla's party. She invited 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members = 45 people. But, 4 people can't make it, so 45 - 4 = 41 people will be there.

The theater rental is $125 for the first 20 people, and then it's $6 extra for each person after that. So, 41 - 20 = 21 extra people. That means it'll cost an extra 21 * $6 = $126.

Finally, we add the initial cost and the extra cost: $125 + $126 = $251.


$251
"
"Okay, so Maggie and Riza both started with $60. Maggie spent a quarter of hers, which is $15 (60 / 4 = 15). Riza spent a third of hers, which is $20 (60 / 3 = 20).

That means Maggie has $45 left (60 - 15 = 45) and Riza has $40 left (60 - 20 = 40).  

Together they have $85 left (45 + 40 = 85).


85 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

First, we know the first monkey eats 10 bananas a day. The second monkey eats 4 more than that, so it eats 14 bananas a day (10 + 4 = 14).

Together, the first two monkeys eat 24 bananas each day (10 + 14 = 24).

Since there are 315 bananas for the whole week, that means there are 45 bananas each day (315 / 7 = 45).

That means the third monkey eats 21 bananas a day (45 - 24 = 21).


21 

"
"Okay, so Teddy did half of a 500-piece puzzle, which is 250 pieces. Then he did a whole other 500-piece puzzle.  That's 250 + 500 = 750 pieces in total.


750 

"
"Okay, so Jenny buys 15 roses, which is one dozen and three extra. A dozen roses cost $15, and three roses cost $6 (3 x $2). That means the roses cost a total of $21.

She pays with five five-dollar bills, so she has $25.  Her change is $4 ($25 - $21).

Since quarters are worth $0.25, she gets 16 quarters in change ($4 / $0.25).


16 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* He sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each, so that's 6 * $5.50 = $33.00
* He sells 9 burger platters at $11 each, so that's 9 * $11 = $99.00
* He sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, so that's 20 * $1.50 = $30.00

Now, to find the total, we add up all his earnings: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00


$162.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

The first train comes in 10 minutes and hangs around for 20 minutes. The second train shows up 30 minutes after the first one leaves, so that's 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes. The second train only stays for 5 minutes (a quarter of the first train's time).

The third train gets there an hour after the second train leaves, so that's 60 + 5 + 60 = 125 minutes. This train takes off right away.

Finally, the train Paul needs arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, meaning he'll be waiting for 125 + 20 = 145 minutes. 

145 



"
"Okay, so Melanie needs 200 toothpicks total. She's already saved 10 toothpicks a week for 12 weeks, so that's 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.  She needs 200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.

Since she saves 10 each week, it'll take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks. 


8 

"
"Okay, so Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, so he sold it for $1800.  That means his friend saved $200 compared to the original price.  To find the percentage discount, we divide the savings by the original price and multiply by 100: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.


10 

"
"Okay, so if one spring makes a jellyfish every second, that's 60 jellyfish a minute and 3600 jellyfish an hour.  If you have 5 springs, they'd make 5 times that amount, so 18,000 jellyfish an hour.  Over 4 hours, that's 72,000 jellyfish! 



"
"Okay, so Binkie scored 90. Frankie scored 15 more than double Binkie's score.  Double Binkie's score is 90 * 2 = 180.  Then add 15 to that: 180 + 15 = 195.

Frankie's score was 195. 



"
"Okay, so James walks 4 miles to the store, but turns around halfway. That means he walks 2 miles to the halfway point, then 2 miles back home.  That's a total of 4 miles walked before he even gets to the store!

Then he has to walk another 2 miles to actually reach the store. So, he walks 6 miles total.

Since he walks at 4 miles per hour, it takes him 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours to get to the store. 


1.5 

"
"Okay, so Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas, so that's 10 * 4 = 40 bananas total.

If she bought them individually, it would cost 40 * $0.80 = $32.00.

But she bought them in bunches for 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.

That means she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.


$2.00 

"
"Okay, so Sam and Harry have 100 feet of fence total. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, which means we need to figure out how to split the rest.  

Think of it like this: if we take away Harry's extra 60 feet, they'd have the same amount as Sam. That means they'd have 100 - 60 = 40 feet to split evenly.

So Sam would get half of that: 40 / 2 = 20 feet.


20 

"
"Okay, so the crocodile grows 8 inches every 4 years.  That means it grows 2 inches each year (8 / 4 = 2).  

If it grows 2 inches a year, in 13 years it'll grow 26 inches (2 x 13 = 26).


26 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

*  Trekking bikes are half the sales, so Marcel sold 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.
* BMX bikes are 15% of sales, so he sold 300 bikes * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.
* That means he sold 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

* BMX bikes cost half of an MTB, so they're $500 / 2 = $250 each.

*  Earnings from Trekking bikes: 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* Earnings from BMX bikes: 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* Earnings from MTB bikes: 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

* Total earnings: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 


Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bikes that month. 

"
"Okay, so the farmer makes 5 bales every hour for 6 hours, which is 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck picks up 3 bales every hour for 6 hours, so it takes 3 * 6 = 18 bales.  That means there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales left in the field.


12 

"
"Okay, so John has 8 classes a day because he takes 2 extra. That's 8 classes times 40 minutes each, which is 320 minutes of class every day.  

Over a week, that's 320 minutes a day times 5 days, so 1600 minutes in class.

Then he studies for another 100 minutes each day on the weekend, so that's 200 minutes more.

In total, he learns for 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes a week.

That's 1800 minutes divided by 60 minutes in an hour, which equals 30 hours. 


30
"
"Okay, so the ball starts on the third floor, which is 3 floors * 24 feet/floor = 72 feet high.

After the first bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of that height, which is 72 feet * (2/3) = 48 feet.

Then, on the second bounce, it goes up to 2/3 of 48 feet, which is 48 feet * (2/3) = 32 feet.


So the answer is 32. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 6 * 12 = 72 inches.

The second child is 2 inches taller, so they are 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, making them 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.

Finally, the fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so they are 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.


72 

"
"Okay, so they sold 2000 apples and each bag has 10 apples. That means they sold 2000 / 10 = 200 bags of apples.

If each bag costs $5, then they made 200 * $5 = $1000. 


$1000 

"
"Okay, so the Allosaurus ate 270 kg, and that was half of what was left after the velociraptors were done.  That means the velociraptors left 270 * 2 = 540 kg.

Since the 540 kg was half of what the T-Rex left, the triceratops must have had 540 * 2 = 1080 kg of meat to begin with.


1080 

"
"Okay, so Tony needs to figure out how much paint he needs for his room.  

Let's see... the big walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, so each one is 80 square feet. Since there are two of those, that's 160 square feet. The smaller walls are 5 feet by 8 feet, which is 40 square feet each. With two of those, that's another 80 square feet.

So, in total, he needs to cover 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so he'll need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.

If each gallon costs $12, then the total cost will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144. 


$144
"
"Okay, so Ellen starts with 3 shaken sodas out of 12.  Her brother takes one shaken one, leaving 2.  There are 8 sodas left total. So, her friend has a 2 out of 8 chance of grabbing a shaken soda.  That's like 25%. 


25%
"
"Okay, so one train is going 60 miles per hour and the other is going half that, which is 30 miles per hour.  Since they're going in opposite directions, we add their speeds together to see how fast they're moving apart. That's 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour.

After 3 hours, they'll be 90 miles/hour * 3 hours = 270 miles apart.


270 

"
"Okay, so Billy helps 2 people every hour, and he works for 3 hours a day. That means he helps 2 * 3 = 6 people each day.

There are 31 days in March and 19 in April, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days total.

He takes 20% of those days off, so he takes 50 * 0.20 = 10 days off.

That means he works for 50 - 10 = 40 days.

Finally, he helps 6 people per day, so over 40 days he helps 6 * 40 = 240 people.


240 

"
"Okay, so there were 12 buses and each one held 35 people, so that's 12 * 35 = 420 people. Then there were 20 cars with 3 people in each, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 people.  

To find the total, we add those together: 420 + 60 = 480 people.


480 

"
"Okay, so Mike is 24. Martha is 4 years younger than him, making her 20.  Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he's 30. 


30
"
"Okay, so the big slide is 300 feet long and you go 60 feet per minute. That means it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes to slide down.

The smaller slide is 240 feet long and you go 80 feet per minute, so that's 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

The big slide takes 2 minutes longer than the smaller one. 



"
"Okay, so Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks every day. That's 30 + 30 = 60 minutes of breaks each day.

Over five days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes of breaks.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 300 minutes is equal to 300 / 60 = 5 hours.


5 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, so he ran 3.5 * 8 miles = 28 miles.  Together, Amber and Micah ran 8 miles + 28 miles = 36 miles.  That means Ahito ran 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles. 


16 

"
"Okay, so Sheila starts with $85.00 on her card. Then she returns something for $15.00, so she's at $70.00.

The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00, which is $4.00 off. So the pan costs $16.00.

The towels are 10% off $30.00, which is $3.00 off. So the towels cost $27.00.

Adding those together, her new purchases are $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00

Finally, we add that to her balance: $70.00 + $43.00 = $113.00


$113.00
"
"Okay, so a fifth of the jellyfish are big, and a third of those big ones change color.  That means 6 jellyfish changing color represents a third of the big jellyfish.  So there must be 6 * 3 = 18 big jellyfish.

If 18 jellyfish are a fifth of the total, then there are 18 * 5 = 90 jellyfish in the tank. 


90 

"
"Okay, so Chris is 4. Ben is twice as old as Chris, making him 8.  Caroline is three times older than Ben, so she's 24. 


24
"
"Okay, so Lauren wants to retire and live on 40% of her salary, which is $100,000. That means she needs $40,000 a year to live on.  She wants to do this for 20 years, so she needs a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 saved up.

She saves 20% of her salary each year, which is $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000.

To get to $800,000, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.


40 

"
"Okay, so Marty starts with 100 centimeters of ribbon. He cuts it into four equal pieces, so each piece is 25 centimeters long (100 / 4 = 25).  Then he cuts each of those pieces into five even smaller pieces. That means each tiny piece is 5 centimeters long (25 / 5 = 5).


5 

"
"Okay, so if 40% of the school is 240 boys, that means the whole school is made up of 100%.  To find out how many students are in the whole school, we can set up a proportion: 40/100 = 240/x.  

Solving for x, we get x = 600. That means there are 600 students in total. Since 240 are boys, there must be 360 girls.


360 

"
"Okay, so she spent $19 on pots and $26 on soil, which is $19 + $26 = $45 total.  But then she had a $7 off coupon, so she spent $45 - $7 = $38. 


$38
"
"Okay, so there are six women in total. Three have 4-inch heels and three have 2-inch heels.  To find the average, you add up all the heel heights and divide by the number of women.

So, it's (4 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 6 = 18 / 6 = 3 inches. 


3 

"
"Okay, so Soledad wants to hike a ton of miles in June!  She's planning on hiking 125 miles twice a day, which is 250 miles a day.  That's a lot!

If she does that for the whole month, she'll hike 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles. But she wants to hike 9300 miles.

So she needs to hike 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 more miles.

To get those extra miles in, she needs to hike 1800 miles / 30 days = 60 more miles each day.


60 

"
"Okay, so let's figure this out. 

They have 3 red balls at $9 each, so that's 3 * 9 = $27.

Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each, which is 11 * 5 = $55.

Finally, they have 25 green balls at $3 each, making 25 * 3 = $75.

To find the total, we add up all the earnings: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.



"
"Okay, so they have 12 kg of apples total. Peter wants a quarter, which is 12 / 4 = 3 kg. Paul wants a third, which is 12 / 3 = 4 kg.  Together, that's 3 + 4 = 7 kg. That leaves 12 - 7 = 5 kg for Jacques. 


5 

"
"Okay, so it started at 2 degrees. Then it got 8 degrees colder, so that's 2 - 8 = -6 degrees.  But then it warmed up 3 degrees, so -6 + 3 = -3 degrees.

The temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Raymond starts with $21, then gets $11 more, so he has $21 + $11 = $32.  He spends $5 on a comic, leaving him with $32 - $5 = $27. Then he spends another $19 on a puzzle, so he has $27 - $19 = $8 left.

"Okay, so Anna started with $16 and spent $4, leaving her with $12.  She has $2 left now, which means she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on books. Since she bought two books, each book cost $10 / 2 = $5. 


$5
"
"Okay, so last year they had 50 students. This year there were 20% more students.  To find out how many more students there are, you multiply 50 by 0.20 (which is 20% as a decimal). That's 10 more students.  So this year there are 50 + 10 = 60 students.


60 

"
"Okay, so the lighthouse blinks 255 times every 5 minutes.  That means it blinks 51 times each minute (255 divided by 5).  To find out how long it takes to blink 459 times, we divide the total blinks by the blinks per minute: 459 blinks / 51 blinks per minute = 9 minutes.

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

First, we need to see how many male and female fish Tate has to start. He has 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfish, so that's 7 male fish. He has 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfish, for a total of 12 female fish.

Then he buys more fish: 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfish, bringing his total male fish to 11. He also buys 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfish, making his total female fish 16.

Finally, we subtract the number of male fish from the number of female fish: 16 - 11 = 5.


Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish. 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Amalia mowed the lawn for 4 hours. Megan took 2 hours longer than that, so she spent 4 + 2 = 6 hours walking the dog. Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia, meaning she spent 4 + 4 = 8 hours doing laundry.  

To find the total time, we add up the time each person spent: 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.


18 

"
"Okay, so John drives 70 miles per hour and it takes him 2 hours to get to his parents. That means it's 70 * 2 = 140 miles each way.  Since it's a round trip, he drives 140 * 2 = 280 miles every time he visits. He visits twice a month, so he drives 280 * 2 = 560 miles a month.


560 

"
"Okay, so Sofie walks 10 miles a day for 7 days, which is 10 * 7 = 70 miles.  Brian walks half as much as Sofie, so he walks 70 / 2 = 35 miles.


35 

"
"Okay, so they need to make 400 toys, right?  And four of the workers make 6 toys an hour each for 10 hours, that's 120 toys each, so 240 total. Then the other two workers make 4 toys an hour for 10 hours, so that's 80 toys each, for a total of 160.  So those four workers made 240 + 160 = 400 toys.  

But they still need 20 more toys, so the last worker must have made 20 toys.  That means they made 20 toys / 10 hours = 2 toys per hour.


2 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds. Elijah's first dog is a quarter of that weight, so it weighs 60 / 4 = 15 pounds. His second dog is half the weight of Kory's, meaning it weighs 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  

So, Elijah's dogs weigh a total of 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  Adding that to Kory's dog's weight, we get 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.


105 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Kris got 7 stickers from someone and had 9 of his own, meaning he had 7 + 9 = 16 stickers total before giving some to Rob.

Those 16 stickers were half of what Luis had, so Luis had 16 * 2 = 32 stickers.

Luis got those 32 stickers from Seth, who gave him half his stickers. This means Seth started with 32 * 2 = 64 stickers.


64 

"
"Okay, so John has 3 bags of M&Ms, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. That's a total of 30 ounces of M&Ms (3 x 10 = 30).

If each ounce has 30 M&Ms, he has a total of 900 M&Ms (30 x 30 = 900).

Since he wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag, he can make 90 small bags (900 / 10 = 90).


90 

"
"Okay, so Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day.  Halfway around the Earth is 40,000 kilometers / 2 = 20,000 kilometers.  To figure out how many days it takes him, we divide the total distance by his daily distance: 20,000 kilometers / 400 kilometers/day = 50 days.


50 

"
"Okay, so the average car goes 120 mph. The second fastest car is 5 times faster than that, which is 120 * 5 = 600 mph.  The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest, so it goes 600 * 1.25 = 750 mph. 

750 

"
"Okay, so Liam is 16 now, which means two years ago he was 14.  The problem says that two years ago, Liam was twice as old as Vince.  So Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago. That means Vince is 9 now. 


9 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

We know Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs total, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  That means Sarah painted 30 - 12 = 18 eggs. Camden painted 18 + 12 = 30 eggs.

Arnold and Madeline painted the rest of the eggs, which is 56 - 30 = 26 eggs. Since they painted the same amount, they each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

Finally, Camden painted 30 - 13 = 17 more eggs than Arnold.


17 

"
"Okay, so Nik has a lot of crayons!  Let's see... he's got 200 crayons and wants to put 8 in each box. That means he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so all the boxes together weigh 25 * 8 = 200 ounces. The crayons themselves weigh 200 ounces too since each one is 1 ounce.

That's a total of 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.  Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight is 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.


25 

"
"Okay, so this tree is 80 feet tall, but he can only use 80% of it, which is 64 feet.  He makes logs that are 4 feet long, so he gets 64 / 4 = 16 logs.  Each log gives him 5 planks, so that's 16 * 5 = 80 planks. If he sells each plank for $1.20, he makes 80 * $1.20 = $96. 


$96
"
"Okay, so Valerie makes $5000 a month, and that's half of what her brother makes.  So her brother makes $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Together they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

Their mom makes twice that, so she makes $15000 * 2 = $30000.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.


45000 

"
"Okay, so Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  We know she takes 40 minutes for the beach part.  

Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, the sidewalk mile takes her half the time of a beach mile, which is 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Adding those times together, her whole walk takes 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes.


60 

"
"Okay, so Jane saves $4 each week.  She's been doing that for 8 weeks, so she has $32 saved up already.  She wants to have $60, so she needs $28 more.  If she saves $4 each week, it will take her 7 more weeks to reach her goal. 


7 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

So, we have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each, that's 3 * 7 = 21 birds. Then there are 2 more trees with 4 birds each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 birds. And finally, one last tree has 3 birds.

Adding them all up: 21 + 8 + 3 = 32 birds


32 

"
"Okay, so Bob ends up with 60 marbles after getting 2 dozen more. That means he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles to start.  If he loses 10, he'll have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left. 


26
"
"Okay, so Donny needs the water to be at least 40 degrees.  The colder water is bringing the temperature down, so the other water has to be pretty warm to make up for it.

Let's see... he's mixing 4 ounces of the cold water with 1 ounce of the warmer water. That means the warmer water has a bigger impact on the final temperature.  

Since the mix has to be at least 40 degrees, the warmer water has to be way hotter than that to make up for the cold water. I'd say the second bottle has to be at least 68 degrees. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

He starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  

Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows a day for three weeks, which is 20 cows/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows.

Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens a day for three weeks, so that's 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens.

So, after three weeks he has 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

That means he has a total of 470 + 230 = 700 animals.


700 

"
"Okay, so Russell buys 4 packs of bagels at $10 a pack, so that's 4 * $10 = $40.  But he gets a 10% discount, which is $40 * 0.10 = $4 off.  So the bagels actually cost him $40 - $4 = $36.

Since each pack has 9 bagels, he gets 4 * 9 = 36 bagels total.

That means each bagel costs $36 / 36 = $1.00. 


$1.00
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

It says it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes, which is 3 potatoes, to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops. So, 3 potatoes make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

That means each scoop needs 3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes.

Gomer ate 23 scoops - 5 scoops = 18 scoops.

So, he ate 18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes/scoop = 27 potatoes. 


27
"
"Okay, so Chester eats a lot of eggs!  

Let's see... 3 eggs a day for 30 days is 3 * 30 = 90 eggs. Then he eats 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, so that's 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

In total, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs in 60 days.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he needs 240 / 12 = 20 dozen eggs.


20 

"
"Okay, so there are 17 green jelly beans and double that amount of red ones, which is 17 * 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  That means there are 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans altogether.  If there are 60 jelly beans total, then there must be 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Tim has 5 trees and each one gives him 6 lemons every year. That means he gets 5 * 6 = 30 lemons each year.  

A decade is 10 years, so over a decade he'd have 30 * 10 = 300 lemons. 


300 

"
"Okay, so there are 5 parts men and 9 parts women, making a total of 14 parts on the bus.  That means each ""part"" is equal to 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

There were originally 9 parts women * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.


34 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Faraday makes $2 for each single sunflower and $8 for a bouquet.  Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, each sunflower, whether it's sold alone or in a bouquet, earns him $2 + $0.67 = $2.67.

Over three days, he makes $2.67 per sunflower * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He made a total of $26 from single sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days.

That means he sold $82 / $8.01 per sunflower = 10.24 sunflowers.

You can't sell parts of sunflowers, so he sold 10 sunflowers. 


10 

"
"Okay, so Adam starts with $100. He buys rocks for $5 each, so he can buy 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.

He sells 60% of them, which is 20 * 0.60 = 12 rocks.

If he sells each rock for $7, he makes 12 * $7 = $84.

Since he spent $100 and only made $84, he loses $100 - $84 = $16. 


$16
"
"Okay, so Lauren has a lot of scenes to draw! Let's figure out how long it will take her.

* For the big scenes, she draws 5 a day, and she needs to do 45, so that's 45 / 5 = 9 days.
* For the medium scenes, she does 6 a day, and she has 36 to do, so that's 36 / 6 = 6 days.
* For the small scenes, she does 7 a day, and she has 49 to do, so that's 49 / 7 = 7 days.

Now, to find the total time, we add up the days for each type of scene: 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days.


22 

"
"Okay, so Chatty has 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.  She's splitting them evenly between her 4 kids.  That means each kid gets 36 / 4 = 9 eggs. 


9 

"
"Okay, so Jen has 3 fish and each one needs $1 of food every day.  That means she spends $3 each day on fish food.  May has 31 days, so she spends $3 x 31 = $93 on fish food for the whole month.


$93 

"
"Okay, so Patricia starts with 30 roses, gives 24 to her mom, leaving her with 6. Then she buys 15 more, so she has a total of 21 roses. 


21
"
"Okay, so Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then another 140 miles in 3 hours.  To find his average speed, we need to figure out the total distance he traveled and the total time it took.

That's 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles total.

And the total time is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now, to get the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.


50 

"
"Okay, so the first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win, meaning it has a 20% * 3 = 60% chance of winning.

To find the chance of both happening, we multiply those probabilities together: 20% * 60% = 12%.


12% 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  Jim has 27 seashells, and that's 5 more than Carlos, so Carlos has 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.  Carlos has twice as many as Carrey, meaning Carrey has 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

In total, they have 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  If they split them evenly, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.


20 

"
"Okay, so Mason eats carrots every day. He eats 4 carrots Monday through Friday, which is 4 * 5 = 20 carrots. Then on the weekend, he eats 5 carrots each day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 carrots.  In total, he eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots a week.


30 

"
"Okay, so the second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes. That means the second song is 5 * 0.60 = 3 minutes longer.  

So the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.

In total, the cassette is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes long. 


13 

"
"Okay, so Linus buys each phone for $20 and sells them for double that, which is $40. That means he makes a $20 profit on each phone.

He bought 2 phones on Monday, so he made $20/phone * 2 phones = $40.

On Tuesday, he bought 4 phones and made $20/phone * 4 phones = $80.

In total, he made $40 + $80 = $120 in profit.


120 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than her, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, making him 6 feet tall. Since Carl's cane is half his height, it's 3 feet long. 


3
"
"Okay, so Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle gives you 20% of the energy you need for the whole day.  That means they're covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs right now.

We need to figure out how much more they need to make to cover 100% for 2300 people. That's 2300 people * 100% = 230,000% total energy needed.

So, they need to make enough extra to cover 230,000% - 840% = 229,160% more energy.

Since each bottle is 20%, they need to make 229,160% / 20% = 11,458 bottles more.


11,458 

"
"Okay, so Carla has eight babies, and three-quarters of them wear purple. That's 6 babies. The other quarter wear blue, so that's 2 babies.

Then, a third of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows, which is 2 babies.  All the blue-wearing babies also wear bows, so that's another 2 babies with bows.

In total, there are 4 babies wearing bows. Since 2 of them are wearing purple and bows, the chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 2 out of 4, or 50%. 


50
"
"Okay, so they got 1907 reports on Monday and Tuesday, and then 2136 on Thursday and Friday.  That's a total of 1907 + 2136 = 4043 reports for those four days.

Since they got 5168 reports all week, they must have gotten 5168 - 4043 = 1125 reports on Wednesday.


1125 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land. He sells half of it for $50, so that's 80 / 2 = 40 square meters sold.

He has 80 - 40 = 40 square meters left. Then he sells a quarter of that, which is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters, for $30.

That leaves him with 40 - 10 = 30 square meters. He sells the rest of it at $3 per square meter, so he makes 30 * $3 = $90.

To find his total earnings, we add up all the money he made: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.



"
"Okay, so Haley is 26. Half of Haley's age is 13.  If Geb is 10 years younger than that, he's 3 years old.

"
"Okay, so Tyrion uses 2 masks each time he goes out, and he goes out 3 times a day. That means he uses 2 * 3 = 6 masks every day.  Over two days, he'd use 6 * 2 = 12 masks. 

12 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5, Stacy found twice that amount (5 * 2 = 10 eggs), and Charlie found 2 less than Stacy (10 - 2 = 8 eggs). Mei found half as many as Charlie, so she found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hidden. 


9
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each, so that's 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.
* The third complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined, meaning it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments than the first two.
* That makes the third complex 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.
* In total, he collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.
* He goes to each place 3 times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.
* He makes $0.40 per collection, so he earns 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 each week. 


$1728.00
"
"Okay, so this avocado tree thing is a bit tricky. Let's see...

* A 5-year-old tree gives 50 fruits.
* A 6-year-old gives three times that, so 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.
* A 7-year-old gives seven times the original amount, so 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.
* An 8-year-old gives 200 less than a 10-year-old.
* A 10-year-old gives 20 times the original amount, so 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits.
* That means an 8-year-old gives 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
* The 9-year-old doesn't give any fruit.

Adding all those up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. And all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

To figure out the red rope's length, we need to work backwards.  

Let's think about it like this:

* If the blue rope was the same length as the yellow rope, the red rope would be four times that length.
* Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, we need to figure out how much shorter the red rope is because of that.

It's a bit tricky, but we can do it! 


Let me know if you want to work through the steps together. 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Rissa got three times the amount Ronnie did, so she had 3 * $5 = $15.  

After giving some money to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. That means she gave away 1/5 of her money, which is $15 * (1/5) = $3.

Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister. So, he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.


$2
"
"Okay, so half the mural is yellow, which means it used 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow paint.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're used in equal amounts, each of those colors used 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.


2 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.

Since there are four bedrooms, the total bedroom space is 240 * 4 = 960 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.


3160 

"
"Okay, so Alice starts with 3 clouds on Monday. Then each day she sees double the amount from the day before.  

That means Tuesday she sees 6, Wednesday she sees 12, Thursday she sees 24, and Friday she sees 48.

To find the total, we add up all the clouds: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds. 


93
"
"Okay, so the bigger box has 20% more pods than the regular one, which means it has 100 + (20/100)*100 = 120 pods.  Since the box still costs $12, that means you get 120 / 12 = 10 cycles for every dollar you spend. 


10
"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Thomas starts with $1000, which is 50 twenty-dollar bills. He loses 10, leaving him with 40. Then he uses 20 to pay a bill, so he has 20 left.  If he triples that amount, he has 60 twenty-dollar bills. That's $1200 total.

To figure out how many five-dollar bills that is, we divide: $1200 / $5 = 240 five-dollar bills.


240 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

Team B scored 2 fewer goals than Team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B went wild and scored 4 times the amount from the first half, meaning they scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A only scored a quarter of that in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up Team A's goals from both halves, they scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals.

Team B scored a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Finally, adding both teams' scores together, there were 6 + 10 = 16 goals in the whole match.

"
"Okay, so the teacher starts with 5 inches of chalk and uses 45% on Monday, which is 2.25 inches (5 x 0.45). That leaves him with 2.75 inches of chalk (5 - 2.25).

He uses 20% of the chalk each day, which is 0.55 inches (2.75 x 0.20).  

So, he can use the chalk for about 5 days (2.75 / 0.55) before it's too small. But since he can't use it when it's less than 2 inches, he can only use it for **2** more full days. 


2 

"
"Okay, so there are 12 boys and 12 girls, making a total of 24 students.  One-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 girls. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, which is 12 / 4 = 3 boys. That means 4 + 3 = 7 students are on varsity.  

If 7 students are on varsity, then 24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.


17 

"
"Okay, so Mike has 5 face masks. Johnny has 2 more than three times that amount.  

Three times the number Mike has is 5 * 3 = 15.

Two more than that is 15 + 2 = 17.

Johnny has 17 face masks. 

"
"Okay, so the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 11 (4 + 7). That means they fixed a total of 15 teeth (4 + 11).  To find the percentage, we divide the number of fixed teeth (15) by the total number of teeth (30) and multiply by 100.  That gives us 50%.

"Okay, so Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of it went bad. That means 1600 gallons were bad (4000 * (2/5) = 1600).  Since each gallon cost $3.50, the spoiled milk cost him $5600 (1600 * $3.50 = $5600).

$5600 

"
"Okay, let's break this problem down.

Let's say Wendy's age now is ""w"" and Colin's age now is ""c"".

We know two things:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years. That means w = 5(c + 7) 
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can use these two equations to figure out Colin's current age (""c"").

First, let's solve the first equation for ""w"":

w = 5c + 35

Now, let's plug that value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Let's simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20


So, Colin is currently 20 years old. 

"
"Okay, so Bob has $27,000 to spend on books for 3 schools. That means each school gets $9,000 ($27,000 / 3 = $9,000).

He can buy 100 books for $500, which means each book costs $5 ($500 / 100 = $5).

With $9,000 per school, he can buy 1800 books for each school ($9,000 / $5 = 1800).


1800 

"
"Okay, so let's break this down. 

He starts with 2 apples, then 5 more fall. That's 7. He keeps one and throws one back up, so he has 6 in his pocket. Then 6 more fall, so there are 12 plus the one he kept, which is 13.

He takes home 13 apples. 



"
"Okay, so Ali needs 850 kilos of coal. Each bag has 50 kilos, so he needs 850 / 50 = 17 bags.  If each bag costs $18, then his total cost is 17 * $18 = $306. 


$306
"
"Okay, so Kate's friends are gonna eat a lot of pizza!  Let's see... 6 friends eating 6 slices of cheese each is 36 slices total.  And 6 friends eating 4 pepperoni slices each is 24 slices.  

That means she needs 3 cheese pizzas (36 slices / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas) and 3 pepperoni pizzas (24 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas).

So, she needs a total of 6 pizzas. 


6 

"
"Okay, so Sam ran 3 miles three times this week, which is 3 * 3 = 9 miles. Then he ran 5 miles two times, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 miles.  In total, he ran 9 + 10 = 19 miles.


19 

"
"Okay, so Jay makes 20 snowballs an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. That means every hour, 8 snowballs melt (since there are four 15-minute intervals in an hour).

So, he's actually gaining 12 snowballs each hour (20 made - 8 melted).  To get to 60 snowballs, it'll take him 5 hours (60 snowballs / 12 snowballs per hour = 5 hours).


5 

"
"Okay, so Digimon is 20 years old, and John is 28 now. That means John was 8 years old when Digimon first came out (28 - 20 = 8).

The problem says John was twice as old as Jim back then, so Jim was 4 years old (8 / 2 = 4).

Since Jim was 4 when Digimon came out, he's 24 now (4 + 20 = 24).


24 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Doxa ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more than that, so she ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more than his sister, meaning he ate 3 slices.  

In total, they ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices. 

6 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

They used 38 bandages the first day and ordered 50 more, so they had 38 + 50 = 88 bandages.

On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.

The third day they got 2 packs of 50, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They used half a pack, so that's 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.

At the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.  So before using any on the third day, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages.

That means they had 103 - 100 = 3 bandages before getting the new packs on the third day.

So, they started with 3 + 88 = 91 bandages. 


91 

"
"Okay, so her haircut cost $30 per inch and she got 2 inches cut off (10 inches - 8 inches = 2 inches).  That means the haircut was $30/inch * 2 inches = $60.  

Then you add the $40 for the color, so the total is $60 + $40 = $100. 



"
"Okay, so Jen works a lot! Let's see... she makes $1.50 every hour and works 7.5 hours each day. That's $1.50 x 7.5 = $11.25 per day.

Since she works 6 days a week, she makes $11.25 x 6 = $67.50 each week.

April has 4 weeks, so she earns $67.50 x 4 = $270.00 for the whole month.

Oh, and she gets an extra $10 for perfect attendance! So her total pay for April is $270.00 + $10.00 = $280.00.


$280.00 

"
"Okay, let's break this down.

* He did the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each, so that's 6 * $0.50 = $3.00
* He did laundry once for $3.00.
* He took out the trash twice at $0.75 each, so that's 2 * $0.75 = $1.50
* He cleaned his room once for $1.50.

Adding it all up: $3.00 + $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $9.00

Jason earned $9.00. 



"
"Okay, so a whale has 40 gallons of blood, and a shark has three times that amount, which is 40 * 3 = 120 gallons.  If ten sharks are swimming around, they'd have a total of 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons of blood. 

1200 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

So, 50 people came in the morning. Then 40 more came around 10:00. That's 50 + 40 = 90 people.

Then twice the number who came at 10:00 came later, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 more people. Now we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.

Finally, three times the number who came in the morning came in the evening, which is 50 * 3 = 150 people.

Adding everyone up, we get 170 + 150 = 320 people.


320 

"
"Okay, so Alain's mom bought twice as many black pens as red pens, which means he has 5 packs of red pens * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.  That's a total of 5 packs + 10 packs = 15 packs of pens. Since each pack has 5 pens, he has 15 packs * 5 pens/pack = 75 pens. 


75 

"
"Okay, so John spends $600 on 10 bottles of scotch, which means each bottle costs $60. Cognac is 50% more expensive, so each bottle costs $60 + ($60 * 0.50) = $90. He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  That means he spends 20 * $90 = $1800 on cognac. In total, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.


$2400
"
"Okay, so Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which is 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day. That's a total of 30 + 50 = 80 trees on the second day.

In total, he planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees over the two days.


140 

"
"Okay, so Fred started with 24 gallons. His kids drank 4, then his wife spilled 7, and his friend drank 5.  That's a total of 4 + 7 + 5 = 16 gallons gone.

So, he had 24 - 16 = 8 gallons left for the party.

With 3 people at the party plus Fred, that's 4 people sharing.

Each person gets 8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons. 


2 

"
"Okay, so let's think about this.  If eight more than four times the number of mugs is 40, we need to work backwards.  

First, subtract 8 from 40, which gives us 32. That means four times the number of mugs is 32.

Then, divide 32 by 4 to find out how many mugs there are. That's 8!


**Answer:** 8 

"
"Okay, so there are 66 fish total. One-third of them have red stripes, which is 66 / 3 = 22 fish.  That leaves 66 - 22 = 44 fish without red stripes.

Then, 5/11 of those fish have blue stripes, so that's (5/11) * 44 = 20 fish.

In total, there are 22 + 20 = 42 fish with either red or blue stripes. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Amy starts with two palettes that have 4 eyeshadows each, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadows. Then she has three makeup sets with 6 eyeshadows each, so that's 3 * 6 = 18 eyeshadows.  

That means she has a total of 8 + 18 = 26 eyeshadows.

Her sister takes one of the palettes, which has 4 eyeshadows, so Amy loses those. That leaves her with 26 - 4 = 22 eyeshadows.

Finally, she uses half the eyeshadows from one makeup set, which is 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadows.

So, Amy has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadows left. 


19
"
"Okay, so Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his house is 7 times his height, which is 60 * 7 = 420 inches.

The first floor is three times his height, so that's 60 * 3 = 180 inches.

If the whole house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, then the second floor (including the roof) is 420 - 180 = 240 inches tall.

Since the first floor is 180 inches, the roof must be 240 - 180 = 60 inches above the second floor. 


60 

"
"Okay, so the Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells, which is 280 shells (700 * 0.40 = 280).  That leaves 420 shells (700 - 280 = 420).

The Finders got 60% of those leftover shells, so they found 252 shells (420 * 0.60 = 252).

That means the Gogetters found the rest, which is 168 shells (420 - 252 = 168).


168 

"
"Okay, so Bernie has four dogs and they need to walk an average of 3 miles each. That means they need to walk a total of 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

The first three dogs need to walk 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.  

That means the last dog needs to walk 12 - 8 = 4 miles. 


4 

"
"Okay, so John's house is worth $250,000, and he borrows 40% of that, which is $100,000. Then he uses 60% of the loan, or $60,000, to pay off his debts.  That means he has $40,000 left over. 


$40,000
"
"Okay, so Deandre caught three tunas. They weighed 56, 46, and 26 kilograms. That's a total of 128 kilograms of tuna (56 + 46 + 26 = 128).

If each kilogram of tuna sells for $0.50, he'll make $64.00 for all of it (128 x 0.50 = 64).


$64.00 

"
"Okay, so Trinity buys the magazines for $72.  She sells them for 11/8 of that price, which is like 1.375 times the original price.

To find out how much she sells them for, we multiply: $72 * 1.375 = $99

Her profit is the selling price minus the buying price: $99 - $72 = $27


$27 

"
"Okay, so the dehumidifier takes out 1 liter of water a day on low.  On medium, it's twice that, so 2 liters a day. On high, it's twice the medium setting, meaning it takes out 4 liters a day.

So, on low for 3 days, it takes out 1 * 3 = 3 liters.

On medium for 3 days, it takes out 2 * 3 = 6 liters.

And on high for 5 days, it takes out 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Adding those all up, it takes out a total of 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters. 


29 

"
"Okay, so they had 10 packs of balloons with 30 in each pack, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 balloons total.  If they had 12 left over, they must have thrown 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.


288 

"
"Okay, so Saanvi needs three times more of the second medicine than the first. That means she needs 14 mL * 3 = 42 mL of the second medicine.

In total, each dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

If she takes 8 doses, that's 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = 448 mL.


448 

"
"Okay, so Ali's class can hold 120 students. John's classes are each 1/8 the size of Ali's, so each of John's classes can hold 120 / 8 = 15 students. Since John has two classes, they can hold a total of 15 * 2 = 30 students.  

That means both schools together can hold 120 + 30 = 150 students.


150 

"
"Okay, so Stephen owes his sister $300 plus 2% interest. That means the interest is $300 * 0.02 = $6.

So, he owes a total of $300 + $6 = $306.

He pays $25 each month for 11 months, which is $25 * 11 = $275.

That means he still owes $306 - $275 = $31 in the twelfth month.


$31 

"
"Okay, so Jordan has two kids who each need their diapers changed 5 times a day. That's 2 kids * 5 diapers/kid = 10 diaper changes total.  His wife does half, so she does 10 / 2 = 5 diaper changes. That means Jordan does the other 5. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Tim's trying to guess how many red jelly beans are in a jar.  

First, we gotta figure out how much space is in the jar. It's a square, so the bottom is 6 inches by 6 inches, which is 36 square inches. Then it's 15 inches tall, so the total space is 36 square inches times 15 inches, which is 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't fit perfectly, right? They leave some air gaps.  He said they only use about 80% of the space, so that's 540 cubic inches times 0.80, which is 432 cubic inches.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide 432 by 0.15 to see how many fit: 432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans.

He thinks 30% are red, so that's 2880 times 0.30, which is 864 red jelly beans.

But the real answer is 900. So he was off by 900 - 864 = 36 jelly beans. 



"
"Okay, so the bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more get on, so there are 20 + 40 = 60 people.

At the next stop, 3/4 of the people who got on at the first stop get on, which is (3/4) * 40 = 30 people. Now there are 60 + 30 = 90 people.

Then at the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 * 2 = 180 people.

The bus can hold 200 people, so there's room for 200 - 180 = 20 more people.


20 

"
"Okay, so Pauline goes to the museum 3 times a year and it costs $2 each time. That's 3 * $2 = $6 per year.

Over 5 years, she spends $6/year * 5 years = $30.

Then the price goes up by 150%, which is like adding another $2 * 1.5 = $3 to the original price.

So now each visit costs $2 + $3 = $5.

For the next 3 years, she spends $5/visit * 3 visits/year * 3 years = $45.

In total, she spends $30 + $45 = $75. 



"
"Okay, so there are 10 students in each grade who get to try the escape room, and each group can only have 8 students. That means each grade needs to split into two groups. Since there are four grades, that's a total of 8 groups.

Each group gets 45 minutes, so it will take 8 groups * 45 minutes/group = 360 minutes for everyone to go. 


360 

"
"Okay, so John made 4 tables at $20 each, so that's 4 * $20 = $80. He also made 2 roof frames at $10 each, so that's 2 * $10 = $20.  To find the total, we add those together: $80 + $20 = $100.

Ali has to pay John $100. 

"
"Okay, so Ian's board is 40 feet long, and he wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is four times bigger than the shorter one.  

To figure out how long the longer piece is, let's think about it like this:

* If we think of the shorter piece as 1 part, the longer piece is 4 parts.
* That means there are a total of 1 + 4 = 5 parts.
* Each ""part"" is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.
* Since the longer piece is 4 parts, it's 4 * 8 feet = 32 feet long.


So the longer piece is 32 feet long. 

"
"Okay, so Aiden wants 80 meatballs and he gets 16 meatballs from every pound of beef. That means he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, so he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.


10 

"
"Okay, so Luke has five windows, and each one is 35 inches wide.  That means all the windows together are 5 * 35 = 175 inches wide.  He needs twice that amount of fabric, so he should buy 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric. 


350 

"
"Okay, so the first 16 minutes cost $0.25 each, so that's 16 times 0.25 which is $4.00.  Then the price drops to $0.20 a minute for the rest of the call.  That means the other 20 minutes cost 20 times $0.20, which is another $4.00.  

So the whole call would cost $4.00 plus $4.00, which is $8.00. 


$8.00
"
"Okay, so it rained 2 inches on Monday.  Tuesday's rain is supposed to be 1 inch more than double that amount. Double Monday's rain is 2 * 2 = 4 inches.  Then add the extra inch, so Tuesday will get 4 + 1 = 5 inches of rain. 


5
"
"Okay, so Carly needs enough cupcakes and brownies for everyone in her class to have two treats. That's 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats total.

Let's say she makes 'c' cupcakes. She makes 3 times that many brownies minus 2, so that's 3c - 2 brownies.

Adding the cupcakes and brownies, we get c + (3c - 2) = 10

Combining like terms, we have 4c - 2 = 10

Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4c = 12

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that c = 3.


So Carly made **3** cupcakes. 

"
"Okay, so a manicure is $35 and a pedicure is $40, making them $75 together.  They have a deal for 20% off if you do both, so that's $75 times 0.20 which is $15 off. That means the manicure and pedicure together cost $60.

Nail art is $3 per nail, and she wants it on all 10 fingers, so that's $30 for the nail art.  Adding that to the manicure and pedicure price, it's $60 + $30 = $90.


$90 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Susan gets 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year, so that's 3 * 12 = 36 issues.

Then she has one magazine that sends 6 issues.

Her last magazine sends 4 times the 6 issue one, so that's 6 * 4 = 24 issues.

Adding them all up: 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.


66 

"
"Okay, so Samantha has 27 paintings and that's 12 less than Shelley.  That means Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. 

31 

"
"Okay, so the toy started at $40. Then in December, the price went up by 80%, which is like adding 80% of $40, which is $32. So in December it cost $40 + $32 = $72.

But then in January, the price dropped by 50%. That means it went down by half of $72, which is $36. So the final price in January was $72 - $36 = $36.


$36 

"
"Okay, so Charlie makes $80 for each regular lesson, and he has four of those, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

For veterans, he takes 25% off his normal price, which is $80 * 0.25 = $20 off.  That means he charges veterans $80 - $20 = $60 per lesson.

He has two veteran lessons, so he makes 2 * $60 = $120 from those.

In total, he makes $320 + $120 = $440 today.


$440
"
"Okay, to find Sally's mean score, you add up all her quiz scores and then divide by how many quizzes she took.  

So, 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Then, 630 divided by 9 quizzes equals 70. 

Her mean score is 70. 

"
"Okay, so Eve started with 20 pomelos. If she has 1/4 of them left, that means she has 5 pomelos now (20 / 4 = 5).  She gave away the rest, which is 15 pomelos (20 - 5 = 15).


15 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Walter starts with 60 apples. He eats 2/5 of them, which is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples. That leaves him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Then he gives his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.  Now he has 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Finally, he sells these apples for $3 each, so he makes 27 * $3 = $81. 


$81
"
"Okay, so Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's three-quarters of the novels she wrote this year.  To find out how many she wrote this year, we can think of it like this: if 9 novels is 3/4, then 1/4 would be 9 divided by 3, which is 3 novels.  That means she wrote 4 times that amount this year, so 3 times 4 equals 12 novels.


12 

"
"Okay, so Michael's driving 50 km every hour, and he does that for 3 whole days.  That's 24 hours a day times 3 days, so he's driving for 72 hours total.

If he goes 50 km each hour for 72 hours, he covers 50 * 72 = 3600 km.

The trip from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km, so he's covered 3600 / 6000 * 100% = 60% of the distance.


60 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That means they used a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes for the juice and Madeline's snack.

Their mom used 48 grapes for the pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies (4 pies * 12 grapes/pie = 48 grapes).

To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, we add the grapes used for juice/snack and the grapes used for pies: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.


84 

"
"Okay, so there were 82 teachers total, but 13 were out sick. That means 82 - 13 = 69 teachers were there.  They also had 9 substitute teachers, so 69 + 9 = 78 teachers were at school that day.


78 

"
"Okay, so Bud makes mac and cheese every week.  The pasta is a buck, the cheddar is three bucks, and the gruyere is double the cheddar, so that's six bucks.  That means each week he spends ten bucks total (1 + 3 + 6 = 10).  

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he spends 10 times 52, which is 520 bucks on mac and cheese every year.


520.00 

"
"Okay, so they have 80 classrooms to clean and it takes 15 minutes per room, that's 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes of cleaning.

They work 8 hours a day, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. Over 5 days, that's 480 * 5 = 2400 minutes total.

So, cleaning takes up 1200 / 2400 = 0.5 of their time, which is 50%. 

50 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and there are two of those, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 books. The bottom shelf holds twice as many as a middle shelf, meaning it holds 10 * 2 = 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom, so it holds 20 - 5 = 15 books.

That means each bookcase can hold 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases. 


2 

"
"Okay, so Rose buys 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.  She pays $2.40 per dozen, so that's 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 total.

She sells them in groups of 3 for $1.00 each, so she can make 60 / 3 = 20 groups. That means she'll make 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

Her profit is her earnings minus her costs, so $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.


$8.00 

"
"Okay, so Skyler has a bunch of hats. Half are red, which is 100 / 2 = 50 hats. That leaves 100 - 50 = 50 hats left.  

Then, 3/5 of those are blue, so that's (3/5) * 50 = 30 blue hats.

That means there are 50 - 30 = 20 white hats.


20 

"
"Okay, so the jerky is normally $18 a bag, but it's on sale for $3 off.  That means it costs $15.  Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, each stick costs 50 cents. 

50 

"
"Okay, so Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right to pass. That means she needs to get 77 questions right (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).  

To move on, she needs to get 35 more questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).


35 

"
"Okay, so Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and then she makes a bunch of blueberry cubes. The blueberry cubes are 5 times the number of strawberry cubes, but she makes 4 fewer blueberry cubes.  

If she makes 116 cubes total, we gotta figure out how many are blueberry. Let's say she makes 's' strawberry cubes. That means she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.

All together, that's s + (5s - 4) = 116 cubes.

Combining the 's' cubes, we get 6s - 4 = 116.

Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120.

Dividing both sides by 6, we find out she made 20 strawberry cubes (s = 20).

Now, to find the blueberry cubes, we do 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.


96 

"
"Okay, so Ara plays 40 games a year and scores 21 points each game. Over four years, she's played 40 * 4 = 160 games.  That means she's scored a total of 160 * 21 = 3360 points. 

3360 

"
"Okay, so Brendan starts with 10 marbles. He drops half, which is 5. He finds 3 of them, so he has 3 marbles. Then he loses one because it's a bead, not a marble. That leaves him with 2 marbles. 


2
"
"Okay, so Jason needs to sell 15 cars.  He gets one person to visit the dealership for every 25 calls he makes. Then, for every two people who visit, one buys a car.

So, he needs 15 customers to buy cars. That means he needs 30 people to visit the dealership (since 15 x 2 = 30).

To get 30 people to visit, he needs to make 750 phone calls (30 x 25 = 750).


750 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. They have one flashlight per person, so that's 4 flashlights.  

Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles.

The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles.

In total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the flashlights, they have 36 candles + 4 flashlights = 40 candles and flashlights. 


40
"
"Okay, so Mitchell has 2 bags of chips with 55 chips each, so that's 2 * 55 = 110 chips total.  Since there are 5 people in his family, each person gets 110 / 5 = 22 chips. 


22
"
"Okay, so John takes 5 minutes for the first side.  The next two sides take twice as long, so that's 10 minutes each, for a total of 20 minutes. The last two sides take half the time of the first, which is 2.5 minutes each, adding up to 5 minutes.  

Adding all that up: 5 + 20 + 5 = 30 minutes. 



"
"Okay, so there are 20 helmets.  He saw half as many robots, so that's 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  There were twice as many footballs as helmets, meaning there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Adding them all up, he saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items. 


70 

"
"Okay, so Tim works 6 hours a day, which is 360 minutes (6 times 60).  Each call takes 15 minutes, so he does 360 divided by 15, which is 24 calls a day.  Over a 5 day week, that's 24 times 5, or 120 calls. 

120 

"
"Okay, so the old varnish takes 7 minutes per painting, and she's doing 6 paintings, so that's 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.

The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, it's 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.

That means the new varnish takes 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer.


30 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

*  First, the plants needing half a cup need 4 plants * 0.5 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.
* The plants needing a full cup need 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = 8 cups of water.
* That leaves 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants that need a quarter cup each.
* Those 8 plants need 8 plants * 0.25 cups/plant = 2 cups of water.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water every day. 


12
"
"Okay, so Phineas has to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.  

He hops at 20 yards a minute, so that'll take him 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.

Swimming is slower, at 10 yards a minute, so that's 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.

Adding those times together, it takes him 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to get home. 


15 

"
"Okay, so Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks and each box has 8. That means he'll need to buy 56 / 8 = 7 boxes.  Since each box costs $2.00, his total cost will be 7 * $2.00 = $14.00. 


$14.00
"
"Okay, so the main phone is $20.  Each of the other phones costs half that, which is $10. Since there are four extra phones, they cost a total of $10 x 4 = $40.  Adding that to the main phone's cost, the whole plan is $20 + $40 = $60.


$60 

"
"Okay, so Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, which is 120 doughnuts (10 x 12 = 120).  He sells each one for $2, so he makes $240 every day (120 x 2 = 240).

June has 30 days, so he makes $7200 that month (240 x 30 = 7200).


7200 

"
"Okay, so Jade takes 210 photos and uploads 7 at a time, 6 times a day.  That means she uploads 7 * 6 = 42 photos each day.  

To find out how many days it takes to upload all her photos, we divide the total photos by the number she uploads daily: 210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days. 


5 

"
"Okay, so Alicia dry cleans 5 blouses at $5 each, so that's 5 * $5 = $25.  Then she has 2 pairs of pants at $8 each, so that's 2 * $8 = $16. And her skirt costs $6 to clean.  

So each week she spends $25 + $16 + $6 = $47.  Over 5 weeks, that's $47 * 5 = $235. 


$235.00
"
"Okay, so John's normal speed is 150 words per minute, but he gets way faster and can talk 2.5 times that speed.  So that's 150 * 2.5 = 375 words per minute!

He has to talk for 10 pages, and each page has 450 words, so that's a total of 10 * 450 = 4500 words.

To find out how long it takes, we divide the total words by his new speed: 4500 words / 375 words per minute = 12 minutes.


12 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

* On the first day, Conor saw 50 people.
* The next day, there were 20 more people, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 people.
* On the third day, there were twice as many people as the second day, meaning 70 * 2 = 140 people.
* For the rest of the week (4 more days), he saw an average of 60 people each day, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

To find the total, we add up all the people Conor saw each day: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.


500 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

So, the popcorn starts with 20 kernels popping in the first 30 seconds. Then it triples to 60 in the next 30 seconds.  After that, it goes up to 80, and then slows down to 40. Finally, 10 more pop from the leftover heat.

If you add all those up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn.


210 

"
"Okay, so Tim needs enough lemons for 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 1 extra gallon that's super tart.  

He needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, and 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice. So for the regular lemonade, he'll need 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons.

The extra tart lemonade needs twice the lemon juice, so that's 1 gallon * 1 cup/gallon * 6 lemons/cup * 2 = 12 lemons.

In total, he needs 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons. 


36
"
"Okay, so there are 3 German Shepherds eating 5 kg of food each, that's 3 * 5 = 15 kg. Then there are 2 Bulldogs eating 3 kg each, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 kg.  

In total, they eat 15 + 6 = 21 kg a day. Over a week, that's 21 * 7 = 147 kg.


147 

"
"Okay, so there are 10 animals with 2 legs each, that's 10 * 2 = 20 legs. Then there are 15 animals with 4 legs each, so that's 15 * 4 = 60 legs.  

Adding those together, there are a total of 20 + 60 = 80 legs on the farm. 


80
"
"Okay, so there are 4 blue blocks and twice that many yellow blocks, which is 4 * 2 = 8 yellow blocks. That means there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks total.  If there are 32 blocks in all, then there must be 32 - 12 = 20 red blocks. 

20 

"
"Okay, so Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph, which means he covers 5 * 18 = 90 miles. Then he turns around and drives east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering 8 * 18 = 144 miles.  

Since he drove further east than west, we subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance to find out how far he is from home: 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So Elvis is 54 miles east of his house. 



"
"Okay, so the boat starts at $9000.  The first year it loses 30%, which is $2700 (9000 * 0.30). That means it's worth $6300 after the first year.

The second year it loses another 30%, which is $1890 (6300 * 0.30). So now it's worth $4410.

Finally, the third year it loses 20%, which is $882 (4410 * 0.20).  That leaves it worth $3528.


$3528
"
"Okay, so there are 232 candies in total.  Let's see... there are 54 red ones, and twice that many orange, so that's 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. There are half as many yellow as red, so that's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.  

That means there are 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies.  

So, there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies. 


43 

"
"Okay, so Helen stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and each night cost $80, so the hotel cost 3 * $80 = $240.

Each bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8. She took 7 bus rides, so that's 7 * $8 = $56.

In total, she spent $240 + $56 = $296 on the hotel and buses.


$296
"
"Okay, so Mazie starts with 52 marbles. Dallas ends up with 21, but he lost 4, meaning he had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles to begin with.  That means Darla got the rest: 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.


27 

"
"Okay, so they need two adult tickets at $12 each, which is $24. Then there's one child ticket for $8.  Popcorn is $3 each, and they get two, so that's $6.  Adding it all up: $24 + $8 + $6 = $38. 


$38
"
"Okay, so John's car is super heavy with all that stuff in it.  Let's see... the car weighs 1200 pounds, his luggage is 250 pounds, and his kids are 75 pounds each, so that's another 150 pounds.  That means everything together weighs 1600 pounds.

If he needs to push with 1% of the weight, we gotta do 1600 times 0.01.  That's 16 pounds. 


16 

"
"Okay, so James needs enough crepe paper to go all the way around his fence.  That means we need to find the total length of all the sides added together.  

His fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide.  To find the total length around, we do (20 + 15) * 2 = 70 feet.

So James needs 70 feet of crepe paper. 


70
"
"Okay, so Mia is 40 and her older sister Emma is 16 years older. That means Emma is 56.  To find their average age, you add their ages together (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by 2 because there are two of them. 96 divided by 2 is 48. 


48
"
"Okay, so they found a bunch of seashells, but some were cracked.  Let's see... 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 seashells total.  Then we take away the cracked ones: 732 - 67 = 665.

They found 665 good seashells. 

"
"Okay, so Avery needs a plate setting for each of her 12 guests. Each setting has a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.  Dinner plates are $6 each, bowls are $5, and salad plates are $4.

Let's figure out how much one setting costs: $6 + $5 + $4 = $15.

Now, multiply that by the number of guests: $15 x 12 = $180.00

Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings. 



"
"Okay, so Steve took 10 hours. Half of that is 5 hours. Anna took 2 hours longer than that, so she took 5 + 2 = 7 hours. 


7
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 pounds per pig every day.

Since Dexter has 5 pigs, they eat a total of 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed each day.

Over a week, that's 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.

If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'd have 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left. 


20 

"
"Okay, so John needs enough hot dogs for 20 people, and they each want 2 hot dogs. That's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 36 more.

Hot dogs come in packs of 6, so he'll need 36 divided by 6, which is 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack costs $2, so 6 packs will cost 6 times 2, which is $12. 


$12
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Frances makes $40 from the cupcakes (20 cupcakes * $2 each) and another $40 from the cookies (40 cookies * $1 each). That's a total of $80 earned.  She spends $20 on trays (5 trays * $4 each).  So, she has $60 left over ($80 - $20).


$60 

"
"Okay, so the ice cream truck starts with 5 kids. Then on the next street, each of those kids brings a friend, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 kids.  On the third street, each of those 10 kids brings two more friends, so that's 10 times 2, which is 20 kids. But then the first 5 kids get tired and leave, so we take away 5 from the 20. That leaves us with 15 kids.


15 

"
"Let's see... Mamou started with 1360 meals and gave out 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.  

That means she has 1360 - 142 = 1218 meals left. 


1218
"
"Okay, let's see... a quarter is worth 25 cents. Two nickels are 10 cents, and seven dimes are 70 cents.  If you add those up, he has 105 cents. 



"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

The younger brother is 12, and the older brother is twice that age, so he's 12 * 2 = 24.  The sisters are all 16, and there are three of them, so their total age is 16 * 3 = 48.

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add up everyone's age: 12 + 24 + 48 = 84.


84 

"
"Okay, so Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day (15 minutes in the morning and 15 at night). That's 210 minutes a week. She also does yoga for an hour, five days a week, so that's another 300 minutes.  

In total, she does 510 minutes of practice each week. Over four weeks, that's 2040 minutes.


2040 

"
"Okay, so Octavia's quilt is made of different sized t-shirts.  Let's figure out how much fabric she's using:

* The small shirts are 3 square feet each, and she has 11, so that's 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.
* The medium shirts are 4 square feet each, and she has 8, so that's 8 * 4 = 32 square feet.
* The large shirts are 6 square feet each, and she has 6, so that's 6 * 6 = 36 square feet.

Now, let's add up all the fabric: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.


101 

"
"Okay, so a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is 36 seeds. A large sunflower has 50% more than that, so it has 18 extra seeds (half of 36). That means a large sunflower has 54 seeds (36 + 18).  

 Altogether, there are 90 seeds (36 + 54). 


90 

"
"Okay, so George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times that amount, which is 18 * 3 = 54 pens. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so she has 54 / 2 = 27 pens. 


27
"
"Okay, let's break this down. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, who is 36 inches tall, so Anne is 36 * 2 = 72 inches tall. Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, meaning Jackie is 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall now.  Since she grew 3 inches over the summer, she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall before summer.


67 

"
"Okay, so they make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell each one for $2. That means they make 5000 * $2 = $10,000 every day.

In a week, that's $10,000 * 7 = $70,000.

Over two weeks, they'd make $70,000 * 2 = $140,000.


$140000 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.

The T-shirts are buy one get one 50% off, so the second shirt is $8 / 2 = $4.  That means the total for the shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.  The shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store. 


$36
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Ryan earns $6 a week for doing his chores, and he did them for 3 weeks, so he made $6 * 3 = $18.

Then he spent $1.25 on each of his 3 friends plus himself, for a total of $1.25 * 4 = $5 on ice cream.

That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left.

Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets. 


2
"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Ellen spent $100 on leggings plus $5 on a frame, so that's $105. Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 each on two bathrobes, which is another $200.  Adding those together, $105 + $200 = $305.

So they spent a total of $305. 



"
"Okay, let's break this down.

So, each jar needs $12 worth of passion fruit, $12 worth of jackfruit, and $20 worth of honey, for a total of $44 per jar.

He sells each jar for $50, so he makes a profit of $6 per jar ($50 - $44 = $6).

If he sells 10 jars, he makes a total profit of $60 ($6/jar * 10 jars = $60).


$60 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

* Quarters are worth 25 cents each, so 32 quarters are worth 32 * $0.25 = $8.00
* Dimes are worth 10 cents, so 95 dimes are worth 95 * $0.10 = $9.50
* Nickels are worth 5 cents, so 120 nickels are worth 120 * $0.05 = $6.00
* Pennies are worth 1 cent, so 750 pennies are worth 750 * $0.01 = $7.50

Now, add up all the values: $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00


$31.00
"
"Okay, let's figure this out.  

Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, and then $7.50 per ticket for her and her sister, so that's $7.50 x 2 = $15.00 for the movies.  She also got a bracelet for $8.50.  

In total, she spent $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00.

If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00 left.


$13.00
"
"Okay, so Josh works 5 days a week and fixes 3 cars each day. That means he works on 15 cars every week (5 days * 3 cars/day = 15 cars).

He makes $4 for each car, so he earns $60 each week (15 cars * $4/car = $60).

Over two weeks, he'd make $120 ( $60/week * 2 weeks = $120).


$120 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. Randy starts with 9 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 5 sugar cookies, for a total of 18 cookies. He eats one of each kind for a snack, leaving him with 16. Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, bringing his total down to 14. He gives away 2 sugar cookies, leaving him with 12. Finally, he bakes 4 of each type of cookie, adding 12 more to his stash. That means he has 12 + 12 = 24 cookies. 


24
"
"Okay, so Matthew has 12 toy soldiers.  Half of them, which is 6, would sell for $5 each, so that's 6 * $5 = $30. The other 6 would sell for $7 each, so that's 6 * $7 = $42.  If he sells them all, he'd make $30 + $42 = $72.


72 

"
"Okay, so the dog digs a ton of holes while Nate's gone! Let's see... 6 holes a day for 14 days is 84 holes total.  

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night, so he's really only getting rid of 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).

To fill all 84 holes at that rate, it'll take him 28 days (84 / 3 = 28).

That's 4 weeks (28 / 7 = 4). 


4 

"
"Okay, so Norman High School has 4000 students. Butler High School has 3/4 of that, which is like 3 out of every 4 students compared to Norman.  That means Butler has 3000 students (3/4 * 4000 = 3000).

To find the difference, we subtract: 4000 - 3000 = 1000.

Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School. 



"
"Okay, so they made a bunch of cookies total, right?  Let's see... 2595 rainbow cookies plus 3075 oatmeal cookies is 5670 cookies.  If they made 7995 cookies in all, then they must have made 7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies.


2325 

"
"Okay, let's break this down. Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only got half, so that's 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.  Igor got 2 more Petri dishes than the 14 requested, meaning he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.  

We know Igor put 29 items on the bench in total.  If he had gotten everything right, he would have had 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 items. That means he lost 37 - 29 = 8 items. Since he got the right number of beakers, he must have lost 8 - (16 - 8) = 0 beakers.

So the answer is 0. 



"
"Okay, so James needs screws for 4 tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. That means he needs 4 * 4 * 2 = 32 screws. Since he has 40 screws, he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over. 


8 

"
"Okay, so the first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice that amount, which is 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.  To find the total, we add the eggs from both baskets: 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.


30 

"
"Okay, let's figure this out. 

Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Okay, so Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, who runs 2 miles because Vanessa runs 4.  Aaron finished his 2 miles in 16 minutes, so he runs a mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa runs twice as slow, so she takes 16 minutes per mile. Since she ran 4 miles, it took her 16 minutes/mile * 4 miles = 64 minutes.

"Okay, so he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, and there's 200 feet of dock. That means he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line total.  But he already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.

"Okay, so they get 6 groups of people each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open two nights a week, they make $90 x 2 = $180 a week.

"Okay, so the vendor bought the watermelons for $80 and made a 25% profit.  That means he made an extra $20 ($80 x 0.25 = $20).

So, he sold all the watermelons for $100 ($80 + $20 = $100).

Since he sold 50 watermelons, each one cost $2 ($100 / 50 = $2).


Answer: $2

"Okay, let's break this down. Dora is turning 12 in three years, so she's currently 9 years old.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  That means John was 19 when James was born, so he's 37 now (18 + 19 = 37).

John's youngest son was born when he was 32, so the son is 5 years old (37 - 32 = 5). In three years, the youngest son will be 8 years old.

"Okay, so Ana peels oranges faster than Jane.  Let's see... there are 60 minutes in an hour.  If Ana peels one orange every 3 minutes, she can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges in an hour. Jane peels one orange every 4 minutes, so she can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges in an hour. That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Okay, so the radiator normally costs $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off.  That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320! So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

Then the mechanic charged him $50 an hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding those together, he paid $80 + $150 = $230 in total.

"Okay, so we know Farmer Brown has 20 animals total, and they're either chickens or cows.  Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4, and all together they have 70 legs.  

To figure out how many chickens there are, we can think about it like this:

* If all 20 animals were chickens, they'd have 40 legs (20 x 2 = 40).
* That means the extra 30 legs (70 - 40 = 30) must come from the cows.
* Since each cow has 2 extra legs compared to a chicken, there must be 15 cows (30 / 2 = 15).
* If there are 15 cows, there must be 5 chickens (20 - 15 = 5).


So the answer is **5**. 

"
"Okay, so they have 7 pizzas and each pizza has 8 slices, that's 7 times 8 which is 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people sharing, they each get 56 divided by 4, which is 14 slices.
