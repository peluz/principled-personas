"Ah, a classic download interruption problem! Let's break it down.

First, we need to figure out how long it took to download the portion of the file before the restart. Since Carla downloads at 2 GB per minute, and she was 40% through the 200 GB file (meaning she downloaded 80 GB), that took 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes.

Then, factor in the 20-minute restart.

Finally, she has to download the remaining 120 GB, which will take another 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes.

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Let's analyze this problem step-by-step using the distance-rate-time formula: distance = rate * time.

* **Outbound Trip:** John travels 60 mph for 3 hours, covering a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.

* **Return Trip:**

    *  He's stuck in traffic for 2 hours, covering 0 miles.
    *  He then drives at 30 mph for 0.5 hours, covering 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
    *  Finally, he drives at 80 mph for the remaining 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours, covering 80 * 1.5 = 120 miles.

* **Total Distance Covered on the Return Trip:** 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles.

* **Distance from Home:** Since he traveled 180 miles outbound and 135 miles back, he is 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Let's model this situation with an equation.  

Let 'x' represent the number of years.

* **Cost:** $90 (initial cost)
* **Earnings:** $7.50x (7 lemons/year * $1.50/lemon - $3.00/year for upkeep)

To find when Carlos starts earning money, we need to find when his earnings exceed his costs:

$7.50x > $90

Divide both sides by $7.50:

x > 12

Therefore, it will take **12 years** before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra.

Let 'x' represent the original number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

* **Green House:** She sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.

* **Remaining:** This leaves her with (2x/3) vacuum cleaners.

* **Red House:** After selling 2 more, she has (2x/3) - 2 left.

* **Orange House:** She sells half of this amount, or [(2x/3) - 2] / 2 = (x/3) - 1.

* **Final Amount:** We know she has 5 left: (x/3) - 1 = 5

Now, let's solve for x:

* (x/3) = 6
* x = 18



Therefore, Melanie started with **18** vacuum cleaners.

* **Electronic Gadgets:** A 1.2% increase on an $8,000 investment yields a profit of $8000 * 0.012 = $96.

Therefore, the merchant would maximize profit by purchasing the jewelry, resulting in a profit of $125. 



"
"Ah, a classic distance problem!  To find the total distance, we need to consider the westward and northward travel as two sides of a right triangle. The total distance each train covers is the hypotenuse of this triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²), where 'a' and 'b' are the legs of the triangle and 'c' is the hypotenuse, we can calculate the total distance:

80² + 150² = c²

6400 + 22500 = c²

28900 = c²

c = √28900 = 170 

Therefore, each train covers a total of **170 miles** in the two days.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

* Let  'x' represent the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

* We know:
    * Distance = Speed * Time
    * Total distance = 12 miles
    * Time for first 6 miles = 2 hours
    * Desired average speed = 4 miles per hour

*  We can set up an equation to represent the total time:

   Total Time = Time for first 6 miles + Time for remaining 6 miles

   3 hours (total time for 12 miles at 4 mph) = 2 hours + (6 miles / x)

* Solving for x:

   1 hour = 6 miles / x
   x = 6 miles / 1 hour
   x = 6 miles per hour



Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of **6 miles per hour** for the remaining distance.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

We'll use the following variables:

* 'g' for the number of gold coins

We're given two key pieces of information:

1. **Total Coins:** s + g = 110 
2. **Gold vs. Silver:** g = s + 30

Now we can use substitution to solve for our unknowns. Since we know 'g' is equal to 's + 30', let's substitute that into the first equation:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Simplify and solve for 's':

2s + 30 = 110
2s = 80
s = 40

We now know Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  Let's plug that back into either of the original equations to find 'g'. Let's use g = s + 30:

g = 40 + 30
g = 70



Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

We know Raymond has 40 jewels (R = 40).  Substitute that into our equation for Siobhan:

* Siobhan's jewels = ((40/2) + 5) - 2

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

We'll use two variables:

*  'w' for the number of games won
*  'l' for the number of games lost

We're given two key pieces of information:

1. **Total Games:** w + l = 22 
2. **Wins vs. Losses:** w = l + 8

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'w'. Since we know 'w' is equal to 'l + 8', we can substitute that entire expression into the first equation:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combining like terms, we get: 2l + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2l = 14

Finally, dividing both sides by 2: l = 7

Now that we know 'l' (games lost) is 7, we can plug that back into either of the original equations to find 'w'. Let's use w = l + 8:

w = 7 + 8

Therefore, w = 15


The team won **15** games.

This means his current salary is 1.40 * $40,000 = $56,000.

Now, we know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago. This means Lylah's salary four years ago was $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately).

Assuming Lylah's salary also increased at the same rate as Adrien's, her current salary is also 140% of her salary from four years ago. This means her current salary is 1.40 * $30,769.23 = $43,076.92 (approximately).

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

* Let  'x' represent the cost of a pepper.

"Let's analyze this situation. We have 500 patient visits per day, each lasting 24 minutes.  That's a total of 12,000 minutes of doctor time (500 patients * 24 minutes/patient). Converting that to hours, we get 200 hours (12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour).

The hospital incurs a cost of $30,000 for the doctors' time (200 hours * $150/hour). However, they generate $40,000 in revenue from patients (200 hours * $200/hour).

Therefore, the hospital's profit is $10,000 ($40,000 - $30,000).

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

*  *q + b + w = 700* (Total bees)
*  *b = 2q* (Twice as many babies as queens)
*  *w = 2b* (Twice as many workers as babies)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'w'.

Since *b = 2q*, we can substitute '2q' for 'b' in the equation *w = 2b*, giving us *w = 4q*.

Substitute both '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' into the first equation: *q + 2q + 4q = 700*

Combining like terms, we get *7q = 700*.

Solving for 'q', we find *q = 100*.

Now, substitute the value of 'q' back into the equation *b = 2q* to find *b = 2 * 100 = 200*.

Finally, substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation *w = 2b* to find *w = 2 * 200 = 400*.

* **Cost:** The cost of the wheat is 20x (20 dollars per bag times the number of bags).
* **Transportation:** The transportation cost is 2x (2 dollars per bag times the number of bags).
* **Total Cost:** The total cost is 20x + 2x = 22x.
* **Revenue:** The revenue from selling the bags is 30x (30 dollars per bag times the number of bags).
* **Profit:** The profit is the revenue minus the cost: 30x - 22x = 8x.

"Ah, a classic tree-counting problem with a twist! Let's break it down.

First, we need to find the net change in trees over 10 years. Tom plants 10 trees and removes 2 each year, resulting in a net gain of 8 trees annually (10 - 2 = 8). Over a decade, that's a total increase of 80 trees (8 * 10 = 80).

Adding this to his initial 50 trees gives us 130 trees after 10 years (50 + 80 = 130).

Finally, 30% of these trees perish, which amounts to 39 trees (130 * 0.30 = 39).  Subtracting this loss leaves Tom with 91 trees (130 - 39 = 91).

* Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age, meaning it was 3000 * (n - 6) = 3000 * 20 = 60000.
* The current population of Chile is double what it was six years ago, so it is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

Let 'd' represent the number of players on defense.

* We know the offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so there are 2d players on offense.
* The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning there are d/2 players on special teams.

The total number of players is the sum of these three groups: d + 2d + d/2 = 105

Combining like terms, we get 3.5d = 105

To isolate 'd', divide both sides by 3.5: d = 30

First, we need to determine the total number of people who remained at the party.  Since 1/4 of the original group departed, 3/4 stayed.  

We know 22 men remained, and this represents a portion of the 3/4 who stayed.  

To find the total number who stayed, we can set up a proportion: 22 men / (3/4 total people) =  x men / (total people).

Solving for the total number of people who stayed, we find there were 30 people remaining.

Finally, subtracting the 22 men leaves us with 8 women.

"Let's break this problem down.  

Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 of those are loose. That means she has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in boxes.

Together, Jam and Meg have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

Assuming each box holds a standard number of pencils, we'd need to know the capacity of each box to determine the exact number of boxes required. However, since we're looking for a whole number of boxes, we can estimate.  

70 pencils divided by a reasonable box capacity (let's say 8 pencils per box) would require 8.75 boxes.  Since we can't have a fraction of a box, they would need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

* **Gross Income:** $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
* **Taxes:** $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
* **Net Income (Job A):** $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B, we first subtract the property tax and then calculate the income tax on the remaining amount.

* **Net Income after Property Tax:** $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
* **Taxes on Net Income:** $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
* **Net Income (Job B):** $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

"To determine Karan's monthly payment, we need to consider both the principal amount borrowed and the accrued interest.  

First, calculate the total interest:

Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100
Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100 = $1825

Next, calculate the total amount to be repaid:

Total amount = Principal + Interest = $3650 + $1825 = $5475

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months to find the monthly payment:

Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months = $5475 / 5 = $1095

"Ah, a classic geometry problem!  Let's break it down. We know the area of a rectangle is length times width, and we're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards, which is 9 feet).  

To find the perimeter, we need the width.  We can use the area formula to find that:

Width = Area / Length = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now, the perimeter is twice the sum of the length and width:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width) = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet

"Let's break down this temperature change problem.  

The oven increases the temperature by 5 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a 15-degree increase (5 * 3 = 15). This brings the temperature to 55 degrees (40 + 15 = 55).

The window being open for 30 minutes, or half an hour, causes a 6-degree decrease (2 degrees per 10 minutes * 3 = 6).

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees (55 - 6 = 49).

"Ah, a triathlon problem! These always involve a bit of percentage play. Let's break it down.

Jon's swim time is 40 minutes. James, being 10% faster, completes the swim in 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, and James takes 5 minutes longer, putting him at 85 minutes.

Jon's total time is 170 minutes (40 + 80 + 50). Since Jon wins by 10 minutes, James finishes in 160 minutes (170 - 10).

Subtracting James's swim and bike times from his total time, we find his run time: 160 - 36 - 85 = 39 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down.

First, we need to convert Movie C's length to minutes: 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes long.

Finally, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, meaning Movie A is 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"Let's break this problem down. First, we need to determine the total distance the horse runs.  Since speed is measured in miles per hour, and the horse runs for 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours), we can calculate the distance:

Distance = Speed x Time = 32 MPH x 0.5 hours = 16 miles

The horse eats 0.5 bales of hay per mile, so for 16 miles, it will consume:

Hay Consumption = 16 miles x 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales

Each bale costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

Total Cost = 8 bales x $3/bale = $24

Michael has six $5 bills, giving him a total of:

Total Money = 6 bills x $5/bill = $30

Finally, to find Michael's change, we subtract the cost of the hay from his total money:

Change = $30 - $24 = $6

"Let's break this problem down algebraically. 

Let 'x' represent the regular price of the popcorn.

* **Scenario 1: Super Ticket**
   * Cost = $20 (ticket) + $1 (popcorn & soda) = $21

* **Scenario 2: No Super Ticket**
   * Cost = $12 (ticket) + x (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $15 + x

We know you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, so:

* $21 (super ticket) - $2 (savings) = $15 + x

Solving for x:

* $19 = $15 + x
* x = $4 


Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $4.

"To maximize popsicle stick production within a budget, we need to determine the most cost-effective lumber option. 

Analyzing the provided data:

* **2x4:** Yields 200 sticks at a cost of $4, resulting in 50 sticks per dollar.
* **2x8:** Yields 400 sticks at a cost of $6, resulting in approximately 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Clearly, the 2x8 lumber offers a higher yield per dollar invested. With a budget of $24, the individual can purchase 4 pieces of 2x8 lumber ( $24 / $6 = 4).

This translates to a total of 1600 popsicle sticks (4 pieces * 400 sticks/piece).

"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to first find the individual prices. 

Four apples cost $5.20, so one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Therefore, five apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $6.50, and five oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $5.50.

The total cost is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.

First, we need to calculate the total taps per minute when Helga's arms are at her sides: 300 taps/minute (right foot) + 250 taps/minute (left foot) = 550 taps/minute.

Over the 3 minutes she dances with her arms down, she'll tap a total of 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 times.

When her arms are raised, her tap rate slows to 200 taps/minute per foot, meaning she taps 200 taps/minute * 2 feet = 400 taps/minute in total.

During the 2 minutes with arms raised, she'll tap 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 times.

* **Monday:** She earns $15 per hour for 5 hours, totaling $15 * 5 = $75.  Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 bonus, bringing her Monday total to $75 + $5 = $80.

* **Wednesday:** She earns $15 per hour for 2 hours, totaling $15 * 2 = $30. She doesn't get a bonus because she taught fewer than 3 classes.

* **Total Earnings:** Adding her earnings from both days, Tanya made $80 + $30 = $110.

"Let's analyze this situation step-by-step.  

First, we determine the number of movies in a series: 600 movies * (1/3) = 200 movies.

The cost of these series movies is 200 movies * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

Next, we find the number of movies not in a series: 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies.

Of these, 40% are older movies: 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies.

The cost of these older movies is 160 movies * $5 = $800.

This leaves us with 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 newer movies.

The cost of these newer movies is 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

Finally, we add up all the costs: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67.

* x = 4.5 (time spent driving)
* Driving speed = 50 miles/hour
* Hiking speed = 50/2 - 5 = 20 miles/hour

Now we can set up equations:

* Distance driven = 50 * x = 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

Let 'x' represent the number of enemies Emma jumps on and 'y' represent the number of berries she collects.  We know the following:

* **Ava's enemies:** x + 8
* **Ava's berries:** y + 3
* **Ava's time:** 4 seconds slower than Emma

Now, let's express their scores in terms of these variables:

* **Emma's score:** 10x + 5y + 30t  (where 't' is the number of seconds remaining on Emma's timer)
* **Ava's score:** 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4)

To find the difference in their scores, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's:

[10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(t - 4)] - [10x + 5y + 30t]

Simplify the expression:

10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30t - 120 - 10x - 5y - 30t

The terms 10x, -10x, 5y, and -5y cancel out, as do 30t and -30t. This leaves us with:

-25 

Therefore, the difference between Ava and Emma's scores is **-25**. This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

* Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob bought.

* Initially, Bob has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.

* He buys 'w' white fish, so his total white fish becomes 4 + w.

* He also buys 17 fish total, and since 'w' of them are white, he buys (17 - w) orange fish. This brings his total orange fish to 3 + (17 - w).

* The problem states that after the purchase, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This translates to the equation: 3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Now, let's solve for 'w':

* 3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
* 20 - w = 8 + 2w
* 12 = 3w
* w = 4



Therefore, Bob bought **4** white fish at the store.

"Let's analyze Britany's TikTok time commitment. 

First, her video creation consumes 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes per week.

Next, her songwriting takes up 2 hours/week * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Finally, her daily makeup routine adds 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.

In total, Britany spends 72 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 282 minutes on TikTok each week.

Over a month with four weeks, this amounts to 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes.

Converting this to hours, we get 1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18.8 hours.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

* **Kagiyami's strength:** Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, who can lift 12 times higher than Pompei's 1 inch. That means Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

* **Naruto's strength:** Naruto is 10 times stronger than Kagiyami, who lifts 48 inches. So Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

Since the turtles travel at half the speed of the kangaroos, it will take them twice as long to cover the same distance.  

If three kangaroos take 18 hours, one kangaroo would take 54 hours.  

Therefore, four turtles traveling at half the speed will take 54 hours * 2 = 108 hours. 

However, because there are four turtles, their combined speed is four times faster than a single turtle. This means the total time will be 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

"To determine the total material needed, we'll use proportional reasoning. 

* **Small Masks:** Since 2 yards of material yield 4 small masks, we can find the material per mask: 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask.  To make 20 small masks, Jo needs 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards of material.

* **Large Masks:** Similarly, 2.25 yards make 3 large masks, meaning each large mask requires 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask. For 8 large masks, she'll need 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards of material.

* **Total Material:** Adding the material needed for both types of masks, Jo requires 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards of material.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

Let Duncan's current age be represented by the variable 'd' and Adam's current age by 'a'.

We know:

*  d - 8 = 2(a - 4)  (Duncan's age 8 years ago was twice Adam's age 4 years ago)
*  d = 60 (Duncan's current age is 60)

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

60 - 8 = 2(a - 4)

Simplifying:

52 = 2a - 8

Adding 8 to both sides:

60 = 2a

Dividing both sides by 2:

a = 30

Therefore, Adam's current age is 30.  To find his age in 8 years, we simply add 8:

30 + 8 = 38

"Ah, a delightful pastry problem! Let's break it down.

First, we need to find the calorie count for each mini pastry. A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3 the calories of a regular cinnamon roll, which has 600 calories. So, a mini cinnamon roll has (1/3) * 600 = 200 calories.

Similarly, a mini blueberry muffin has (1/3) * 450 = 150 calories.

Now, let's calculate the total calories for each type of pastry. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so they have a total of 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories.

He baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, giving them a total of 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

We're given the following information:

* **Combined Age:** Peter + Paul + John = 100
* **Paul's Age:** Paul = John + 10
* **Peter's Age:** Peter = Paul + John

Let's use variables to represent their ages:

* Peter = P
* Paul = Pa
* John = J

Now we can set up a system of equations:

1. P + Pa + J = 100
2. Pa = J + 10
3. P = Pa + J

We can solve for P (Peter's age) using substitution. 

From equation 2, we know Pa = J + 10. Substitute this into equation 3:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now substitute both Pa and P into equation 1:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Simplify and solve for J:

4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Finally, substitute the value of J back into the equation P = 2J + 10:

P = 2(20) + 10
P = 40 + 10
P = 50



Therefore, Peter is 50 years old.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

* Let 'x' represent the number of balls Jeffrey carried.
* Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, so Jason carried 2x balls.
* Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, meaning Jordan carried 2 * (2x) = 4x balls.

The total number of balls is the sum of what each boy carried: x + 2x + 4x = 7x

We know Jason carried 2 balls, so 2x = 2.  Solving for x, we find x = 1.

Therefore, the total number of balls is 7 * 1 = 7.

"Let's denote the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe caught as 'A', Stan as 'S', and Alex as 'X'. We're given the following system of equations:

* S = 4A - 13 
* X = S + 5

We can solve for 'S' (Stan's Pokémon count) using substitution.

1. **Substitute** the first two equations into the third:
   A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

2. **Simplify and solve for 'A':**
   A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339
   9A - 21 = 339
   9A = 360
   A = 40

3. **Substitute the value of 'A' back into the equation for 'S':**

   S = 160 - 13
   S = 147



Therefore, Stan caught 147 Pokémon.

* Let  'x' represent Bill's age when he first saw the comet.

* We know Bill's dad was 30 when he saw the comet, and Bill saw it when he was three times his dad's age, meaning Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old during his second viewing.

* Comet Halley appears every 75 years. This means the time between Bill's dad seeing the comet and Bill seeing it for the second time is a multiple of 75.

*  We can express this as: 90 = x + 75n, where 'n' is the number of 75-year cycles that passed between the two sightings.

* Since Bill was 90 during his second viewing, and the comet appears every 75 years, we know that one full cycle (75 years) must have passed.

* We know that the final charge remaining is 28%, which represents 0.28 of the original charge. This means 0.34x = 0.28x + 0.06x (where 0.06x represents the charge used by her friends).

* Simplifying the equation, we get 0.06x = 0.28x - 0.34x = -0.06x.

* Therefore, the original charge 'x' was 0.06x / 0.06 = 1x, or 100%.

* Since the final charge is 28%, the initial charge when Maria went to the park was 100% - 28% = 72%.

"Ah, a classic savings problem! Let's break it down.  

First, we need to find Janet's total earnings per week. She makes $10 an hour in wages and $15 an hour in tips, for a total of $25 per hour. Working 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours/week = $1000.

Next, we determine the down payment amount.  20% of the $10,000 car is $10,000 * 0.20 = $2000.

Finally, we divide the down payment amount by her weekly earnings to find out how many weeks she needs to save: $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks.

"Let's break down this fruity math problem!

First, we need to find the total cost of Jamaar's current purchases:

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Adding those up, his current spending is $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

He started with $10.00, so he has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since each plum costs $0.25, he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Ah, a classic mining problem! Let's break it down.  

A steel pickaxe increases a dwarf's output by 50% compared to an iron pickaxe. Since an iron pickaxe doubles a dwarf's bare-handed output, a steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 12 pounds * 2 * 1.50 = 36 pounds per day.

Over a 30-day month, a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe would mine 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds.

"To determine the time required to recoup the financial investment in a college degree, we need to consider both the accumulated loan debt and the foregone earnings during the study period.

The total loan amount is $50,000 per year for 4 years, resulting in a total debt of $200,000.  

The individual's income tripled after obtaining the degree, increasing from $25,000 to $75,000 annually.  

During the 4 years of study, the individual lost potential earnings of $25,000 per year, totaling $100,000.

Therefore, the total amount to be earned back is the sum of the loan debt and the lost earnings, which is $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000.

Dividing the total amount to be earned back by the post-degree annual income yields the number of years required: $300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4 years.

"Ah, a classic discount problem! Let's break it down.  

Mr. Rogers got a 25% discount off the original price (100% - 75% = 25%). This means he paid 75% of the original $2000, which is $1500.

When he sold it to his friend for 120% of his purchase price, his friend paid $1800 (120% of $1500).

The friend effectively got a $200 discount off the original price ($2000 - $1800 = $200).

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%.

"Ah, a classic inventory and sales problem! Let's break it down.

First, we know Marcel sold 150 Trekking bikes (half of his total sales).  Those brought in 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500.

Next, 45 bikes were BMX, representing 15% of his sales. Each BMX bike sold for $250 (half the price of an MTB), so those earned him 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250.

That leaves 105 MTB bikes (300 total bikes - 150 Trekking - 45 BMX).  At $500 apiece, those MTBs generated 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500.

Adding up all three types, Marcel earned a total of $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from bicycle sales that month.

*  *m = i - 4* (Martha is 4 years younger than Mike)
*  *i = 24* (Mike is 24 years old)

Now we can substitute to solve for *j*:

1. Since *i = 24*, we know *m = 24 - 4 = 20*.

"Ah, a classic problem involving ratios! Let's break it down.

We know that 6 jellyfish represent one-fifteenth (1/15) of the total number of large jellyfish.  Since these jellyfish are a fifth (1/5) of the total tank population, we can work backwards.

If 6 jellyfish represent (1/15) of the large jellyfish, and the large jellyfish are (1/5) of the total, then 6 jellyfish represent (1/15) * (1/5) = (1/75) of the total jellyfish in the tank.

To find the total number of jellyfish, we can set up a proportion:

"As a financial mathematics expert, I can help you determine how many years Lauren needs to work. 

To achieve her retirement goal, we need to consider her desired retirement income, her savings rate, and her current salary.

Lauren aims to live on 40% of her current $100,000 salary during retirement, which equates to $40,000 per year.  

Over a 20-year retirement, she'll need a total of $800,000 ($40,000 x 20).

Currently, Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary, amounting to $20,000 annually.

"To determine the additional miles Soledad needs to hike each day, we must first calculate her total mileage for June.  

She plans to hike 125 miles twice daily, resulting in a daily total of 125 miles/hike * 2 hikes/day = 250 miles/day.

Over the 30 days of June, this equates to 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.

Since her goal is 9300 miles, she needs to hike an additional 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 miles.

To find the required daily increase, we divide the extra mileage by the number of days: 1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day.

* Let 'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
* Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, Madeline also painted 'A' eggs.
* Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.
* Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted 'S + 12' eggs.

We know the following:

* A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56  (The total number of eggs painted)

"To find out how many more weeks it will take Jane to save $60, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate her current savings:** She saves $4 per week for 8 weeks, so she has saved $4 * 8 = $32.

2. **Determine the remaining amount:** She wants to save $60 and has $32, so she needs $60 - $32 = $28 more.

3. **Calculate the time to reach the goal:** Since she saves $4 per week, it will take her $28 / $4 = 7 more weeks.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

* Let 'x' represent the temperature of the unknown water.

We know the following:

* The final mixture must be at least 40 degrees.
* Donny adds 4 ounces of 33-degree water.
* Donny adds 1 ounce of the unknown water (x degrees).

The total ""degree-ounces"" in the mixture is (33 * 4) + (x * 1) = 132 + x

Since the total volume of the mixture is 5 ounces, the average temperature is (132 + x) / 5.

This average temperature must be greater than or equal to 40 degrees:

(132 + x) / 5 >= 40

To solve for x, we can follow these steps:

1. Multiply both sides by 5: 132 + x >= 200
2. Subtract 132 from both sides: x >= 68


Therefore, the second bottle must be at least **68 degrees**.

* Broilers Limited delivers 10 chickens per day for 3 weeks, totaling 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Adding these to the initial amounts:

* Total cows: 50 + 420 = 470
* Total chickens: 20 + 210 = 230

Finally, the total number of animals is 470 + 230 = 700.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra.

* Let 'x' represent the number of individual sunflowers sold.
* Let 'y' represent the number of bouquets sold.

We know the following:

*  Each sunflower costs $2, so the earnings from individual sunflowers are 2x.
* Each bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers, so the earnings from bouquets are 8y.
* Total earnings from sunflowers are $26 per day, and total earnings from bouquets are $56 per day.

This gives us two equations:

1. 2x + 8y = 26 (daily earnings)
2. 12y (sunflowers in bouquets)

We also know that this occurs over 3 days, so we need to multiply the daily earnings by 3:

3 * (2x + 8y) = 82

Simplifying:

6x + 24y = 82

Now, we need to solve for 'x' (the number of individual sunflowers sold).  To do this, we can use substitution or elimination. Since we're interested in the total number of sunflowers sold, let's focus on the 'y' variable.

From equation 2, we know y = total sunflowers in bouquets / 12.

We can substitute this value of 'y' into the simplified equation and solve for 'x'. However, without knowing the exact number of bouquets sold, we can't get a precise numerical answer for the total number of sunflowers sold.

"Let's break this problem down using algebra.

* Let 'C' represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
* Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected C + 5 seashells.
* Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey collected C / 2 seashells.

The total number of seashells is C + (C + 5) + (C / 2) = 60

To solve for C, we need to combine like terms: 2.5C + 5 = 60

Subtract 5 from both sides: 2.5C = 55

Divide both sides by 2.5: C = 22

Carlos collected 22 seashells.

* Jim collected C + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27 seashells.
* Carrey collected C / 2 = 22 / 2 = 11 seashells.

In total, they have 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 seashells.

Dividing the total seashells equally, each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically.

*  Let 'r' represent the length of the red rope.
*  Let 'b' represent the length of the blue rope.
*  Let 'y' represent the length of the yellow rope.

We're given the following relationships:

* r = 4b (The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope)
* b = y - 7 (The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)
* r + b + y = 37 (The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters)

We can solve for 'r' (the length of the red rope) using substitution.

1. **Substitute** the second equation (b = y - 7) into the first equation:
   r = 4(y - 7)

2. **Simplify:**
   r = 4y - 28

3. **Substitute** both the simplified equation for 'r' and the equation for 'b' into the third equation:
   (4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

4. **Combine** like terms:
   6y - 35 = 37

5. **Add** 35 to both sides:
   6y = 72

6. **Divide** both sides by 6:
   y = 12

7. **Substitute** the value of 'y' back into the equation b = y - 7:
   b = 12 - 7
   b = 5

Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w' and Colin's current age by 'c'.

We're given two key pieces of information:

1. **""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.""** This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

2. **""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.""** This translates to the equation: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have a system of two equations:

* w = 5c + 35
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

We can solve for 'c' (Colin's current age) using substitution.  

From the first equation, we know w = 5c + 35. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c

* j = 28 (John is currently 28)
* j - 20 = 2(i - 20)  (John was twice Jim's age 20 years ago)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second:

* 28 - 20 = 2(i - 20)
* 8 = 2i - 40
* 48 = 2i
* i = 24

Therefore, Jim is currently 24 years old.

"Ah, a classic problem involving proportions and percentages! Let's break it down.

First, we determine the cost per bottle of scotch: $600 / 10 bottles = $60 per bottle.

"To determine the total number of lemons needed, we must first calculate the lemons required for the standard lemonade.  Four gallons of lemonade, at one cup of juice per gallon, will require four cups of lemon juice. Since six lemons yield one cup of juice, Tim will need 4 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 24 lemons for the regular lemonade.

The extra gallon of lemonade, twice as tart, will require twice the lemon juice, or 2 cups. This translates to 2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons.

In total, Tim will need 24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons.

After the first year, the boat loses 30% of its value, which is $9000 * 0.30 = $2700. This leaves the boat worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciates another 30%, meaning a loss of $6300 * 0.30 = $1890. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

Finally, in the third year, the depreciation is 20%, resulting in a loss of $4410 * 0.20 = $882.  The boat's final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

To find out how many slices each person gets, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people.  There are 7 pizzas * 8 slices/pizza = 56 slices in total. With 4 people sharing, each person receives 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices.
