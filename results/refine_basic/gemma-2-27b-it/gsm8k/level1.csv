"Let's break down this real estate problem.  

The house's value increased by 150% of its original price, which is a $120,000 increase ($80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000).

Adding that increase to the original price gives us the post-renovation value: $200,000 ($80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000).

Finally, subtract the total investment (purchase price plus repairs) from the final value to find the profit: $70,000 ($200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000).

"To determine the break-even point, we need to calculate how long it takes for the annual profit from the lemon tree to cover the initial planting cost. 

The tree yields a profit of $7.50 per year ($10.50 earnings - $3.00 expenses).  

Dividing the initial cost by the annual profit gives us the number of years to break even: $90 / $7.50 = 12 years.

"Let's break this problem down.  We can work backward from the information given.

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Before selling to the orange house, she had 5 + (x/3 - 1) = (2x/3) + 4.

Before selling to the red house, she had (2x/3) + 4 + 2 = (2x/3) + 6.

This amount represents 2/3 of her original stock, meaning her starting amount was (3/2) * [(2x/3) + 6] = x + 9.

We know this equals x, so x + 9 = x. This implies that x = 9.

Therefore, Melanie started with **18** vacuum cleaners.

"Let's break this problem down. We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  

We can represent this with two variables:

*  Let 's' be the number of silver coins.
* Let 'g' be the number of gold coins.

We can set up a system of equations:

* s + g = 110 
* g = s + 30

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first:

* s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

* 2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

* 2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

* s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

* g = s + 30
* g = 40 + 30
* g = 70



Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

She spends one-third of her time, or 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours, running.

She spends two-thirds of her time, or 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours, walking.

During her run, she covers 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

During her walk, she covers 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

In total, Dana travels 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The cost of the supplies is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost is $20.00 (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling the candles. He sells each candle for $2.00, and he's making 20 candles, resulting in a total revenue of $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

"Let's break down this installment problem.  

First, the total cost of the phones is 5 phones * $150/phone = $750.

A 2% interest rate on each phone means an extra $150 * 0.02 = $3 per phone in interest.

Across all five phones, the total interest is $3/phone * 5 phones = $15.

Adding the interest to the original cost, Shiela will pay a total of $750 + $15 = $765.

Finally, her monthly payment over 3 months is $765 / 3 months = $255/month.

"This problem involves a geometric sequence.  The area of each level is half the area of the level below it.  

To find the average area, we first need the total area.  

* The top level is 16 square feet.
* The second level is 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
* The third level is 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
* The bottom level is 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

The total area is 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Finally, we divide the total area by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"To determine the most economical option, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package size.

* **Packages of 3:** $2.50 / 3 flowers = $0.83 per flower
* **Packages of 2:** $1.00 / 2 flowers = $0.50 per flower

Since the packages of 2 offer a lower price per flower, Vincent should choose this option.

The cost of 18 flowers using packages of 2 would be 18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00.

By choosing the packages of 2, Vincent saves $15.00 (cost of packages of 3) - $9.00 (cost of packages of 2) = $6.00.

"Let's denote the number of games won as 'w' and the number of games lost as 'l'. We're given two key pieces of information:

* The team played a total of 22 games: w + l = 22
* They won 8 more games than they lost: w = l + 8

We can solve this system of equations.  Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combining like terms: 2l + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2l = 14

Dividing both sides by 2: l = 7

Now, substitute the value of 'l' back into the equation w = l + 8:

w = 7 + 8

Therefore, w = 15. 

The team won 15 games.

*  *q* = number of queen bees
*  *b* = number of baby bees
*  *w* = number of worker bees

We're given the following information:

* *q + b + w = 700* (The total number of bees)
* *b = 2q* (Twice as many babies as queens)
* *w = 2b* (Twice as many workers as babies)

Now we can use substitution to solve for the number of worker bees (*w*).

Since *b = 2q*, we can substitute *2q* for *b* in the equation *w = 2b*:

*w = 2 * (2q) = 4q*

Now we can substitute *2q* for *b* and *4q* for *w* in the equation *q + b + w = 700*:

*q + 2q + 4q = 700*

Combining like terms, we get:

*7q = 700*

Dividing both sides by 7, we find:

*q = 100*

Now that we know *q = 100*, we can find *b*:

*b = 2q = 2 * 100 = 200*

Finally, we can find *w*:

*w = 2b = 2 * 200 = 400*



Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

"To determine Jordan's potential weekly earnings, we need to calculate his daily earnings and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.  

Jordan earns $10 per hour at his part-time job and could work 2 hours per day instead of playing video games. This means he could earn $10/hour * 2 hours = $20 per day.

Over a seven-day week, his earnings would be $20/day * 7 days = $140.

"To find the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year, we need to consider the pineapples per harvest and the number of harvests per year. 

He harvests 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples per harvest.

Since he harvests every 3 months, he harvests 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 times a year.

Therefore, John can harvest a total of 1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests = 4000 pineapples in a year.

"Let's break this problem down logically.  

* **Work Backwards:** The most effective approach is to start with the final number of fries and reverse the actions.

* **Ants:** Five fries were left after the ants took one, meaning there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants.

* **Raccoon:** The raccoon took two-thirds of the fries, leaving one-third. Since 6 fries represent one-third, there were 6 * 3 = 18 fries before the raccoon.

* **Pigeons:** The pigeons ate 9 fries (3 each), so there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries before the pigeons.

* **Seagull:** The seagull ate half of Dave's 14 fries, meaning it ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. There were 27 + 7 = 34 fries before the seagull.

* **Original Amount:** This means Dave started with 34 fries. 



Therefore, there were **34** fries in the pack originally.

"Let's break this problem down. We know Seth's age is double Brooke's, and in two years, their combined age will be 28.  

Let's use algebra to represent this:

*  Let Seth's current age be ""s""
*  Let Brooke's current age be ""b""

We can set up two equations:

1. s = 2b  (Seth's age is twice Brooke's)
2. (s + 2) + (b + 2) = 28 (Their combined age in two years will be 28)

Now, substitute the first equation into the second:

(2b + 2) + (b + 2) = 28

Simplify and solve for 'b':

3b + 4 = 28
3b = 24
b = 8

Now that we know Brooke's age (b = 8), we can find Seth's age using the first equation:

s = 2 * 8
s = 16



Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.

"Let's break this problem down.  A chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, and since each bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, each apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

The total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 bars * 40 grams/bar = 1000 grams.

The total weight of the candied apples is 80 apples * 20 grams/apple = 1600 grams.

"Let's break this problem down. We'll use a system of equations to represent the given information.

* Let 'r' be the number of red chickens.
* Let 'w' be the number of white chickens.

We know the following:

*  w = r + 2  (There are two more white chickens than red chickens)
* 3r + 5w = 42 (The total number of eggs collected daily is 42)

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for 'r':

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Simplify and solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4



Therefore, Jerry has **4** red chickens.

"Let's break down this problem. We know both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.  

Let 'x' represent the current amount of water in the small pool. The big pool currently has 4x water.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool, meaning it had 2x water.

Since both pools lose 4 gallons per minute, the small pool lost 16 gallons in those four minutes (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes). The big pool also lost 16 gallons.

This means four minutes ago, the small pool had x + 16 gallons, and the big pool had 2x + 16 gallons.

We know that 2x + 16 (the big pool's amount 4 minutes ago) is equal to 4x (the big pool's current amount).

Solving for x:

2x + 16 = 4x
16 = 2x
x = 8


Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, we need to find the total distance of a single round trip. The train travels 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles between the first and second cities, and then another 100 miles to the third city.  The return trip from the third city to the first is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

Therefore, a complete round trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip three times a day, it covers a total of 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

Finally, to determine how many days the train can travel before needing service, we divide the total service interval by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

* Joanne gets 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that, or 15, from the shortest trees.
* Her sister doubles Joanne's tallest tree haul (60 apples) and triples her shortest tree haul (45 apples).
* Together, that's 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.
* Since they gathered 500 apples total, Joanne must have collected 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"This problem can be solved using a system of equations. Let 'c' represent the number of camels and 'd' represent the number of dromedaries. We know:

*  c + d = 180 (total heads)
*  2c + d = 304 (total humps)

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

c = 124

Substituting this value back into the first equation:

124 + d = 180

Therefore, d = 56.

"Let's break down this problem.  The key is recognizing that the jogger jeans and tattered jeans were originally the same price.  

Here's why:

* Cole saved $6 total.
* He saved 1/3 of that amount on the jogger jeans, meaning he saved $6 / 3 = $2 on the jogger jeans.
* This means he saved the remaining $6 - $2 = $4 on the tattered jeans.

Since the tattered jeans were on sale for $28 and he saved $4, their original price was $28 + $4 = $32.

Because he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, their original price was also $22 + $2 = $24.

"Let's break this problem down.  Kenny had enough money to buy a $100 ticket and had $50 left over for spending, meaning he earned $50 from selling his cards.

Since he sold each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 per card = 33.33 cards.  Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He sold 2/3 of his collection, so 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total. To find the total number of cards he started with, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.  

Since he can't have half a card, he must have started with 50 cards.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the area of a rectangle is length times width, and we're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards, which is 9 feet).  

To find the width, we can use the formula:

Area = length * width

360 square feet = 9 feet * width

width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now, the perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of the length and width:

"Let's break down this triathlon problem.

* **Jon's Time:** Jon's total time is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

* **James's Swim:** James swims 10% faster than Jon, so his swim time is 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

* **James's Bike:** James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

* **James's Total Time:**  Let 'x' represent James's run time. His total time is 36 minutes + 85 minutes + x = 121 minutes + x.

* **The Difference:** We know James finished 10 minutes behind Jon, meaning his total time is 10 minutes more than Jon's: 121 minutes + x = 170 minutes - 10 minutes.

* **Solving for x:** Simplifying the equation, we get 121 minutes + x = 160 minutes. Subtracting 121 minutes from both sides, we find x = 39 minutes.

"Let's break this problem down. We know the total number of insects is 43.  We also know Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half the number Bodhi found.

To solve for Lily's insects, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent Bodhi's insects as 'B', David's as 'D', and Lily's as 'L'.

We have the following equations:

* L = D + 7
* D = B / 2
* L + D + B = 43

We can substitute the second equation into the first to get:

* L = (B / 2) + 7

Now, substitute both the modified first equation and the second equation into the third equation:

* (B / 2) + 7 + (B / 2) + B = 43

Simplifying this equation, we get:

* 2B + 7 = 43
* 2B = 36
* B = 18

Now that we know Bodhi found 18 insects, we can find David's insects:

* D = B / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

Finally, we can find Lily's insects:

* L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16



Lily found 16 insects.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'x'.

* Red jelly beans are 1% less than blue, so there are 0.99x red jelly beans.
* Green jelly beans are 1% more than blue, meaning there are 1.01x green jelly beans.

The total number of jelly beans can be expressed as: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 4500.

Solving for x, we find that x = 1500 (the number of blue jelly beans).

Now we can calculate the number of red and green jelly beans:

* Red: 0.99 * 1500 = 1485
* Green: 1.01 * 1500 = 1515

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's break down this problem. Jim chews gum at a rate of 1 piece every 2 hours at school.  Since his school day is 8 hours long, he'll chew 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.

Adding in the piece he chews on the way home and after dinner, his total consumption is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces.

He began with 20 pieces and chewed 6, leaving him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces.

Finally, he gives half of his remaining gum to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.

This leaves Jim with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.

"To determine the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to find the individual prices and then calculate the totals.

Let 'x' represent the price of one apple and 'y' represent the price of one orange. We are given the following system of equations:

Now, find the cost of one candy: $1.20 / 4 candies = $0.30/candy

Finally, calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

* 10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00
* 10 candies * $0.30/candy = $3.00

Add those costs together: $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00

"Let's break down this problem. The vaccines cost $20 each, totaling $40. The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, which means it costs 0.60 times the total cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check itself.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

Let 'x' be the total cost of the bill.

* 0.60x = cost of heartworm check

We know the cost of the vaccines is $40, so:

* x = $40 + cost of heartworm check

Substituting the first equation into the second:

* x = $40 + 0.60x

Solving for x:

* 0.40x = $40
* x = $100

John's total bill is $100. Since he brought $125, he leaves with:

* $125 - $100 = $25

"Let's analyze this situation step-by-step.

First, we determine the number of movies in series: 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies.

The cost of these series movies is 200 movies * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

Next, we find the number of movies not in a series: 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies.

Of these, 40% are older movies: 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies.

The cost of these older movies is 160 movies * $5 = $800.

This leaves us with 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 newer movies.

The cost of these newer movies is 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

"This problem requires us to analyze the scoring system and the differences in Ava and Emma's performance to determine the point difference.

Let's break it down:

* **Enemy Jumps:** Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, earning her an extra 80 points (8 enemies * 10 points/enemy).

* **Berry Collection:** Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, giving her an extra 15 points (3 berries * 5 points/berry).

* **Timer Bonus:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, meaning Emma earns 120 more points (4 seconds * 30 points/second).

To find the total difference in their scores, we need to consider the combined effect of these factors.

Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob buys. This means he buys (17 - w) orange fish.

After the purchase, he has:

* Orange fish: 3 + (17 - w)
* White fish: 4 + w

We're told the number of orange fish is double the number of white fish, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

20 - w = 8 + 2w

Combining like terms:

12 = 3w

Solving for 'w':

w = 4



Therefore, Bob bought **4** white fish at the store.

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Finally, dividing both sides by 7: x = 47

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

    * P = Pa + J

* **Solve for P:**

    1. Substitute ""J + 10"" for ""Pa"" in the third equation: P = (J + 10) + J  
    2. Simplify: P = 2J + 10
    3. Substitute ""2J + 10"" for ""P"" and ""J + 10"" for ""Pa"" in the first equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
    4. Simplify and solve for J: 4J + 20 = 100 => 4J = 80 => J = 20

*  S = 4A - 13 
*  X = S + 5
*  A + S + X = 339

Substituting the first two equations into the third, we get:

A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

Simplifying this equation:

9A - 21 = 339

Solving for A:

9A = 360
A = 40

Now, substitute the value of A back into the equation for S:

S = 4(40) - 13
S = 160 - 13
S = 147 


Therefore, Stan caught 147 Pokémon.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

The power bank loses charge at different rates, so we need to calculate the total charge loss before determining the initial charge.

* **Phase 1:** A 9% loss per hour for 5 hours results in a total loss of 9% * 5 = 45%.

* **Phase 2:** A 7% loss per hour for 3 hours results in a total loss of 7% * 3 = 21%.

* **Total Loss:** The combined loss is 45% + 21% = 66%.

This means that 34% of the charge remained after these losses (100% - 66% = 34%).

We know the final charge is 28%, which is 6% less than the 34% remaining after the losses. This 6% represents the charge used by Maria's friends.

Therefore, the original charge must have been 34% (the charge after losses) plus the 6% used by friends, totaling 40%.

Her cookie sales generated 80 cookies * $1/cookie = $80. Her cupcake sales generated 60 cupcakes * $4/cupcake = $240.  This gives her a total of $80 + $240 = $320 in earnings.

After giving her sisters $10 each, she spent a total of $10/sister * 2 sisters = $20.

Therefore, Suzanne has $320 - $20 = $300 remaining.

"Let's break this problem down.  

A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which means they mine 1.5 times the amount they would with an iron pickaxe.  Since an iron pickaxe doubles a dwarf's output compared to bare hands (12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds), a steel pickaxe allows a dwarf to mine 24 pounds * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Over a 30-day month, a single dwarf with a steel pickaxe would mine 36 pounds/day * 30 days = 1080 pounds.

With 40 dwarves, the total monthly output would be 1080 pounds/dwarf * 40 dwarves = 43200 pounds.

"To determine the cost, we first need to find the total area of the walls. The north and south walls each have an area of 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet.  The east and west walls each have an area of 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet.

The total area is 2 * 80 square feet + 2 * 40 square feet = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Since each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

At $12 per gallon, the total cost will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

"Let's break this problem down.  

First, we need to determine the total number of days Billy is available to help. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April before the tax deadline, totaling 50 days. He takes 20% of these days off, which is 50 * 0.20 = 10 days. This leaves him with 50 - 10 = 40 days to help people.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours each day, meaning he assists 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

Finally, over the 40 days he works, he helps a total of 40 * 6 = 240 people.

2. **Return:** After returning a $15.00 item, her balance is reduced to $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

3. **Frying Pan:** The frying pan, originally priced at $20.00, is on sale for 20% off, resulting in a discount of $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.  The frying pan's final price is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

4. **Towels:** The towels, originally priced at $30.00, have a 10% discount, amounting to $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00. The towels cost $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

5. **Total New Purchases:** The frying pan and towels together cost $16.00 + $27.00 = $43.00.

* **Solving for Sarah's eggs:** Combining like terms, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that Sarah painted 9 eggs.

* **Camden's eggs:** Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, he painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

* **Arnold and Madeline:** Together, they painted 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

"Let's break down this land sale problem:

* **Initial Land:** Abraham begins with 80 square meters.
* **First Sale:** He sells half (80 / 2 = 40 square meters) for $50.
* **Second Sale:** He sells a quarter of his remaining land (40 / 4 = 10 square meters) for $30.
* **Remaining Land:** This leaves him with 40 - 10 = 30 square meters.
* **Final Sale:** He sells the last 30 square meters at $3 per square meter, earning 30 * $3 = $90.
* **Total Earnings:** Adding up all his sales: $50 + $30 + $90 = $170. 


Therefore, Abraham will earn a total of $170 after selling all his land.

"Let's break down this problem.  

The first two apartment complexes contribute a total of 200 apartments * 2 = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% larger than the combined size of the first two, meaning it has 400 apartments * 0.60 = 240 more apartments than each of the first two.

This makes the third complex 400 apartments + 240 apartments = 640 apartments.

In total, John services 400 apartments + 400 apartments + 640 apartments = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects from each apartment three times a week, he makes 1440 apartments * 3 collections/apartment = 4320 collections per week.

Finally, at a rate of $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings are 4320 collections * $0.40/collection = $1728.00.

"Let's break this problem down. We're given the following relationships:

* **Red rope (r) = 4 * Blue rope (b)**
* **Blue rope (b) = Yellow rope (y) - 7**
* **r + b + y = 37**

We can solve for the red rope's length (r) using substitution.

1. **Express 'r' in terms of 'y':** Since r = 4b and b = y - 7, we have r = 4(y - 7) = 4y - 28.

2. **Substitute into the combined length equation:** (4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37

3. **Simplify and solve for 'y':** 6y - 35 = 37  =>  6y = 72  => y = 12

4. **Find 'b':** b = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5

5. **Calculate 'r':** r = 4b = 4 * 5 = 20



Therefore, the red rope is **20** centimeters long.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

Each bedroom has an area of 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

Since there are four bedrooms, their total area is 240 square feet/bedroom * 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet.

The living room is five times larger than a single bedroom, meaning it has an area of 240 square feet * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedroom and living room areas gives us 960 square feet + 1200 square feet = 2160 square feet.

Finally, including the remaining 1000 square feet of the house, the total area is 2160 square feet + 1000 square feet = 3160 square feet.

"Let's break down this problem step by step:

* **Initial Bills:** Thomas begins with $1000 / $20 = 50 twenty-dollar bills.

* **Bills Lost:** After losing some bills, he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills remaining.

* **Payment:** Using half his remaining bills for a payment leaves him with 40 / 2 = 20 bills.

* **Tripling Money:** Tripling the value of his remaining bills gives him 20 * 3 = 60 bills (each still worth $20).

* **Total Money:** This equates to a total of 60 * $20 = $1200.

* **Conversion:** Finally, converting to five-dollar bills results in $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.



Therefore, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.

"Let's break down this age word problem. We'll use algebra to represent the ages and relationships given.

* Let Wendy's current age be represented by the variable 'w'.
* Let Colin's current age be represented by the variable 'c'.

From the problem, we can form two equations:

1. **Equation 1:** Wendy's current age is five times the age Colin will be in seven years:  w = 5(c + 7)
2. **Equation 2:** In 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's current age: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have a system of two equations. Let's solve for 'c', which represents Colin's current age.

First, solve Equation 1 for 'w':
 w = 5c + 35

Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2:
c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for 'c':
c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20



Therefore, Colin is currently 20 years old.

First, we need to find the volume of the jar:

* Volume = base area * height
* Volume = (6 inches * 6 inches) * 15 inches
* Volume = 540 cubic inches

"Let's break this problem down. We know the total length of the board is 40 feet, and the longer piece is four times the length of the shorter piece.  

We can represent the shorter piece as 'x'. This means the longer piece is '4x'. The sum of these two pieces equals the total length: x + 4x = 40

Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40.  To isolate x, we divide both sides by 5, resulting in x = 8.

Finally, to find the length of the longer piece, we multiply the shorter piece's length by 4: 4 * 8 = 32.

"Let's break down this problem. Ryan earns $6 per week for chores and completed his chores for 3 weeks, giving him a total of $6 * 3 = $18.  He then spends $1.25 per ice cream cone for himself and 3 friends, totaling $1.25 * 4 = $5.00 on ice cream. This leaves him with $18 - $5 = $13 for movie tickets. Since each ticket costs $6.50, he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Let's break down the profit calculation. 

The cost of passion fruit per jar is 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12.

The jackfruit cost per jar is 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12.

The honey cost per jar is 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20.

The total cost per jar is $12 + $12 + $20 = $44.

Since he sells each jar for $50, his profit per jar is $50 - $44 = $6.

Therefore, his profit for selling 10 jars is $6/jar * 10 jars = $60.

"Let's break this problem down. The dog digs a total of 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.  Each day, Nate fills 9 holes but the dog digs 6 more, resulting in a net decrease of 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.  Therefore, it will take 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill all the holes. This equates to 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

* Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 16 / 2 = 8.
* Igor brought 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
*  He correctly brought 7 beakers.
* In total, Igor brought 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 items.

Since he only placed 29 items on the bench, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 items.

Since he didn't lose any test tubes or Petri dishes, he must have lost 2 beakers.

"Let's break down this problem.  Vanessa runs twice the distance Aaron does, meaning Aaron covers half the distance Vanessa does. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, he completes his portion of the race in half the time it takes Vanessa to run a mile.

We know Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, meaning he runs each mile in 8 minutes. Vanessa, running at half Aaron's speed, takes 16 minutes per mile.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, her total time is 4 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 64 minutes.

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we first need to calculate the total profit. A 25% profit on a $80 cost price is (25/100) * $80 = $20.  

Adding this profit to the original cost gives us a total selling price of $80 + $20 = $100.

Finally, dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons (50) gives us a selling price per watermelon of $100 / 50 = $2.

"Let's analyze the situation. Ana peels oranges at a rate of 1 orange every 3 minutes, while Jane takes 4 minutes per orange.  

In an hour (60 minutes), Ana will peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

Jane will peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"This is a classic system of equations problem. Let's break it down:

* Let 'c' be the number of chickens and 'w' be the number of cows.

We know:

*  c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
* 2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens) using substitution or elimination.  Let's use substitution:

1. Solve the first equation for 'w': w = 20 - c
2. Substitute this value of 'w' into the second equation: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. Simplify and solve for 'c': 2c + 80 - 4c = 70 => -2c = -10 => c = 5



Therefore, there are **5** chickens.
