* **Initial Investment:** Josh spends $80,000 on the house and another $50,000 on repairs, totaling $130,000.
* **Value Increase:** The repairs increase the house's value by 150% of the original price, which is $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.
* **Final Value:** The house is now worth $80,000 (original) + $120,000 (increase) = $200,000.
* **Profit:**  Josh's profit is the final value minus his total investment: $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Let's analyze the situation to determine when Carlos will start profiting from his lemon tree.

First, we need to calculate his annual profit. He earns $1.50 per lemon and harvests 7 lemons each year, resulting in an annual income of $10.50 (7 lemons * $1.50/lemon).  However, he also incurs $3.00 in annual expenses for watering and feeding.  This means his net annual profit is $7.50 ($10.50 - $3.00).

To determine the break-even point, we divide the initial cost of the tree ($90) by his annual profit ($7.50), which equals 12 years.

"Let's break this problem down.  We can use algebra to represent the situation and solve for the unknown.

* Let 'x' be the original number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had.

* She sold x/3 at the green house, leaving her with (2/3)x vacuum cleaners.

* After selling 2 more at the red house, she had (2/3)x - 2 left.

* She then sold half of this remaining amount at the orange house: [(2/3)x - 2]/2 = (1/3)x - 1

* We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners remaining, so: (1/3)x - 1 = 5

* Solving for x:
    * (1/3)x = 6

"Here's how to break down the problem:

First, calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 students * 20% = 4 students.

Next, determine the number of students remaining: 20 students - 4 students = 16 students.

Then, calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance: 16 students * 25% = 4 students.

Finally, subtract the number of contemporary and jazz dancers from the total to find the number of hip-hop dancers: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students.

To express this as a percentage of the entire class, divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students and multiply by 100%: (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%.

"To determine Marissa's required speed, we need to consider the total distance, total time, and the time already spent hiking.

She wants to average 4 miles per hour over a 12-mile trail, meaning the total hike should take 3 hours (12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours).  She's already hiked for 2 hours, leaving her with 1 hour for the remaining 6 miles.

Therefore, she needs to maintain a speed of 6 miles per hour for the rest of the hike (6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour).

"Let's break this problem down. The ratio 7:11 tells us that for every 7 years Darrell has aged, Allen has aged 11 years.  

First, we need to determine the value of one ""part"" of this ratio. We know their combined ages represent 18 parts (7 + 11 = 18). Since their total age is 162, one part is equal to 162 / 18 = 9 years.

This means Darrell is 7 * 9 = 63 years old, and Allen is 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

Finally, to find Allen's age in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Let's break this problem down. We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and the number of gold coins exceeds the number of silver coins by 30.  

We can represent this with two equations:

*  Let 's' be the number of silver coins.
*  Let 'g' be the number of gold coins.

This gives us:

1. s + g = 110 
2. g = s + 30

We can substitute the second equation into the first:

s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2s = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

s = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins:

g = s + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70



Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to figure out how much money John made from selling his Lego sets: 13 sets * $15/set = $195.

We know he spent $160 on video games (8 games * $20/game) and had $5 leftover. This means he had $165 before buying the games.

Since he earned $195 from the Lego sets and had $165 before buying games, he must have sold 11 Lego sets ($195 - $165 = $30, and $30 / $15/set = 2 sets).

Therefore, he has 2 Lego sets remaining (13 - 11 = 2).

Over six hours, she spends one-third of the time running (6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours) and two-thirds of the time walking (6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours).

During those two hours of running, she covers 6 miles/hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

During her four hours of walking, she covers 1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 6 miles.

In total, Dana travels 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles.

The cost of supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax is 2 pounds * $10.00/pound = $20.00.

His total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each is 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00.

Since she's leaving after 30 years, she'll receive the full base amount. Additionally, she becomes eligible for a 5% annual bonus on her pension after 20 years of service. This bonus will be applied for the 10 years between her 20th and 30th year of employment.

The annual bonus is calculated as 5% of $50,000, which equals $2,500.

Therefore, Marcy's total annual pension upon leaving after 30 years will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500.

"Let's break down the cost:

* Aleena pays $140 per month for the first six months, totaling $140 * 6 = $840.
* For the remaining six months, she receives a 10% discount, meaning she pays $140 * 0.10 = $14 less per month.
* Her new monthly rate is $140 - $14 = $126.
* This brings her total cost for the second half of the year to $126 * 6 = $756.
*  Adding the costs for both halves, her total annual expenditure is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"To determine how far Sophia can drive on a full tank, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency and then multiply that by the tank's capacity. 

First, we can find her miles per gallon (MPG) by dividing the distance traveled by the gallons used: 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG.

Then, multiply her MPG by the tank's capacity: 25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

"Let's break this problem down. We can represent the number of wins as 'w' and the number of losses as 'l'.  We're given two key pieces of information:

* The team played a total of 22 games: w + l = 22
* They won 8 more games than they lost: w = l + 8

We can use substitution to solve for 'w'. Since we know w = l + 8, we can substitute that into the first equation:

(l + 8) + l = 22

Combining like terms, we get: 2l + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2l = 14

Finally, dividing both sides by 2: l = 7

Now that we know the team lost 7 games, we can plug that back into the equation w = l + 8:

w = 7 + 8

Therefore, the team won 15 games.

* **Lylah's initial salary:** Adrien's initial salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.  If Adrien's initial salary was 1.30 times Lylah's, we can find Lylah's initial salary: $28,571.43 / 1.30 = $21,978.02 (approximately).

* **Salary increases:** Both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. We know Adrien's salary four years later was $56,000. To find Lylah's salary four years later, we need to determine the percentage increase she received.

* **Lylah's salary increase:** Since Adrien's salary increased by 40%, Lylah's salary likely increased by the same percentage.  

* **Lylah's salary four years later:** Lylah's salary four years later would be $21,978.02 + (0.40 * $21,978.02) = $30,769.23 (approximately).

"Let's break this problem down. Rosie runs at a faster pace initially, covering 10 miles per hour for the first 3 hours. This means she covers 30 miles in that time (10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles).

After that, her pace slows to 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours (7 hours total - 3 hours initial = 4 hours).  In this time, she covers another 20 miles (5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles).

Adding her distances together, Rosie covers a total of 50 miles (30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles).

"Here's how to determine the hospital's profit:

First, we need to calculate the total time doctors spend seeing patients: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12,000 minutes.  Converting this to hours, we get 12,000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

The hospital's cost for doctor time is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

The revenue generated from patients is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.

Therefore, the hospital's profit is $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations.

* Let 'q' represent the number of queen bees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of baby bees.
* Let 'w' represent the number of worker bees.

We're given the following information:

*  The total number of bees is 700:  q + b + w = 700
* There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees: b = 2q
* There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: w = 2b

Now we can use substitution to solve for the number of worker bees.

1. Substitute '2q' for 'b' in the equation w = 2b, giving us w = 4q.

2. Substitute '2q' for 'b' and '4q' for 'w' in the equation q + b + w = 700: q + 2q + 4q = 700

3. Combine like terms: 7q = 700

4. Solve for 'q': q = 100

5. Substitute the value of 'q' back into the equation b = 2q: b = 2 * 100 = 200

6. Substitute the value of 'b' back into the equation w = 2b: w = 2 * 200 = 400



Therefore, there are **400** worker bees in the hive.

Since 160 pieces of straw were used in total, the rats used 160 - 70 = 90 pieces of straw.

Knowing each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, there are 90 / 6 = 15 rats.

Finally, with the rats divided equally among 3 cages, there are 15 / 3 = 5 rats per cage.

"Let's break this problem down using a system of equations. 

Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens and 'w' represent the number of white chickens. We're given the following information:

* **Equation 1:** w = r + 2 (There are two more white chickens than red chickens)
* **Equation 2:** 3r + 5w = 42 (The total number of eggs collected daily is 42)

Now we can use substitution to solve for 'r'. Substitute the first equation into the second equation:

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

We know both pools are losing water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.  Let's use 'x' to represent the current amount of water in the smaller pool. This means the larger pool currently holds 4x gallons of water.

Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool.  This means the larger pool had 2x gallons of water four minutes ago.

Since both pools lose 4 gallons per minute, the larger pool lost 16 gallons (4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes) in that time.  Similarly, the smaller pool also lost 16 gallons.

This means four minutes ago, the smaller pool had x + 16 gallons.

We can now set up an equation:

2x (the larger pool's amount 4 minutes ago) + 16 (gallons lost) = 4x (the larger pool's current amount)

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 16 = 4x

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

16 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 8



Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

Finally, the problem tells us that this population figure represents half of the current population of Chile. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

"Let's break this problem down. We can use algebra to represent the relationships given in the problem.

* Let 'd' represent the number of players on defense.
* The offense has twice the number of players as the defense, so there are 2d players on offense.
* The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, meaning there are d/2 players on special teams.

The total number of players is the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams:  2d + d + d/2 = 105

To solve for 'd', we first combine like terms: 3.5d = 105

Finally, divide both sides by 3.5 to isolate 'd': d = 30 


Therefore, there are **30** players on the defense.

"To determine the number of boxes needed, we first need to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have. Jam has 26 pencils total, and Meg has 46, for a combined total of 70 pencils.  Assuming each box holds a standard number of pencils, let's say 8, they would need 70 pencils / 8 pencils per box = 8.75 boxes. Since you can't have a fraction of a box, they would need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

"Here's how to break down the problem:

First, we need to determine the number of junior programmers. We know they represent 2/5 of the total workforce:

* Junior programmers = (2/5) * 100 employees = 40 programmers

This means there are 60 senior programmers (100 total employees - 40 junior programmers).

Junior programmers earn $2000 per month, while senior programmers earn $400 more, totaling $2400 per month.

Now we can calculate the total salary expenditure for each group:

* Total junior salary = 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000
* Total senior salary = 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

Finally, add the two salaries together to find the company's total monthly programmer payroll:

First, we need to find the total distance of the train's route. The distance from the first to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second to the third is 100 miles. The distance from the third city back to the first is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, meaning it's 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

Therefore, the total distance of one complete round trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

The train makes this trip three times a day, covering a total of 300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles per day.

Finally, the train requires service every 18,000 miles.  Dividing the total service interval by the daily mileage, we find the train can operate for 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days before needing service.

"Let's break this problem down. The ratio 5:6 tells us that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  This means their popsicle amounts can be represented as 5x and 6x, respectively, where x is a constant.

We know their combined total is 165 popsicles, so 5x + 6x = 165. Combining like terms, we get 11x = 165.

To find x, we divide both sides by 11: x = 15.

Next, we know he spent $1.20 on chips (3 bags * $0.40 per bag).  

This means he spent $3.75 on candy bars ($4.95 - $1.20).

Finally, since each candy bar costs $0.75, he bought 5 candy bars ($3.75 / $0.75 per candy bar).

"Let's break this problem down. We know the area of a rectangle is length times width, and we're given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards, which is equal to 9 feet).  

To find the width, we can use the formula:

Area = length * width

360 square feet = 9 feet * width

width = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet

Now that we have both the length and width, we can calculate the perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet)

Perimeter = 2 * 49 feet

Perimeter = 98 feet

"Let's break down the temperature changes:

* **Baking:** The oven increases the temperature by 5 degrees per hour for 3 hours, resulting in a 15-degree increase (5 * 3 = 15).

* **Total Temperature After Baking:** The house starts at 40 degrees and increases by 15 degrees, bringing the temperature to 55 degrees (40 + 15 = 55).

* **Cooling:** The window is open for 30 minutes, which is half an hour.  The house cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes, so in 30 minutes it cools by 6 degrees (2 * 3 = 6).

* **Final Temperature:** Subtracting the cooling effect from the temperature after baking gives us a final temperature of 49 degrees (55 - 6 = 49).

"Let's break down this triathlon problem.

First, we need to figure out James's times for each leg of the race.  We know Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, and James is 10% faster, so James swims in 40 * 0.90 = 36 minutes.

Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, and James takes 5 minutes longer, putting him at 85 minutes.

Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. Since Jon won by 10 minutes, James's total time is 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.

Finally, we can calculate James's run time: 160 (total time) - 36 (swim) - 85 (bike) = 39 minutes.

First, we need to figure out how far the horse runs. Since it travels at 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours), the distance covered is 32 miles/hour * 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

The horse eats half a bale of hay per mile, so it consumes 16 miles * 0.5 bales/mile = 8 bales of hay.

Each bale costs $3, meaning the total cost of the hay is 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

Michael has six $5 bills, giving him a total of 6 bills * $5/bill = $30.

Finally, his change is $30 - $24 = $6.

"Let's break this problem down. We know the total number of insects found is 43.  We also know Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half the number Bodhi found.

To solve for Lily's total, we can use a system of equations. Let's represent the number of insects each person found with variables:

*  Bodhi: B
*  David: D
*  Lily: L

We can set up the following equations:

* L = D + 7 
* D = B / 2
* L + D + B = 43

Now we can use substitution to solve for L.  Since we want to find L, let's substitute the second equation into the first equation:

* L = (B/2) + 7

Now substitute both the modified first equation and the second equation into the third equation:

* (B/2) + 7 + (B/2) + B = 43

Simplify and solve for B:

"To maximize the number of popsicle sticks, Frederick should prioritize the wood that yields the most sticks per dollar.  

A 2x4 provides 200 sticks for $4, which is 50 sticks per dollar. A 2x8 provides 400 sticks for $6, which is approximately 66.67 sticks per dollar.

Since the 2x8 offers a better sticks-per-dollar ratio, Frederick should purchase as many of those as possible within his budget. He can buy four 2x8s with his $24 budget.

This will give him a total of 1600 popsicle sticks (4 pieces * 400 sticks/piece).

"Let's break this down. The oven is consistently overshooting the set temperature by a certain percentage.  

First, we need to determine that percentage. The oven is off by 18 degrees when set to 450 degrees. This means it's overshooting by (18 / 450) * 100% = 4%.

Now, to find the temperature Maggie should set for a recipe requiring 520 degrees, we need to account for this 4% overshoot.  

A 4% overshoot on 520 degrees is 520 * 0.04 = 20.8 degrees.

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 520 - 20.8 = 499.2 degrees.

"Let's break down this jelly bean problem.  We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. Let's represent the number of blue jelly beans as 'x'.  

The problem states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue, meaning there are 0.99x red jelly beans. Similarly, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue, making the number of green jelly beans 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans can be expressed as: x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500

Combining like terms, we get 3x = 4500.

Solving for x, we find that x = 1500, which represents the number of blue jelly beans.

Now we can calculate the number of red jelly beans (0.99 * 1500 = 1485) and green jelly beans (1.01 * 1500 = 1515).

Finally, the difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

"Let's break this problem down.  

First, we need to figure out how many times the tires rotate in a month. Since the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the tires rotate 400 miles/month * (725 rotations/2 miles) = 145,000 times per month.

Now, we know each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing replacement.  Dividing the total rotations by the monthly rotations gives us the lifespan of the tires in months: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

Finally, to find the lifespan in years, we divide the total months by the number of months in a year: 72 months / 12 months/year = 6 years.

Next, we convert megabits per second to megabits per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 3600 seconds in an hour.  We multiply her speed by this conversion factor: 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

"Let's break down this commission problem.  

First, we need to find the company's total cost for the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.  The company paid 30% of that to acquire the cars, so their cost was $250,000 * 0.30 = $75,000.

The total revenue from selling all the cars is 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.  Subtracting the company's cost gives us a profit of $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James earns a 10% commission on this profit, meaning he made $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

Next, we know that 60% of these successful surfers are women.  This means 25 riders * 0.60 = 15 women stay upright.

Finally, to find the number of men who stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of successful surfers: 25 riders - 15 women = 10 men.

"Let's use a system of equations to solve this.  

* Let 's' represent the number of sheep.
* Let 'g' represent the number of geese.

We know the following:

Subtracting the lollipop cost from the total, we find the candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.  

This means each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we can calculate:

* 10 lollipops * $0.40/lollipop = $4.00
* 10 candies * $0.30/candy = $3.00

Finally, adding those costs together, we get $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"Let's break down this savings problem.

First, we need to determine how many coins Neil saves each month. He saves 2/5 more than Rong, who saves 20 coins.  That means Neil saves an additional (2/5) * 20 = 8 coins.  

Therefore, Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong will have saved 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil will have saved 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

In total, they will have saved 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

"Let's break down the costs:

* The vaccines cost $20 each, totaling $40.
* The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, meaning it represents 60/100 * (cost of vaccines + heartworm check) 
*  Let 'x' be the total cost. We know 0.6x = cost of heartworm check.

We can set up an equation:

x = $40 + 0.6x

Solving for x:

0.4x = $40

x = $100

John's total bill is $100. Since he brought $125, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

"Let's break down the cost of the crate:

* **Bananas:** 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00 (since each banana costs twice the price of an apple, which is $0.50)
* **Apples:** 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* **Oranges:** 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00 (oranges cost three times the price of a banana)

Adding these costs together, the total price of the crate is $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00.

"To determine the total quarts produced in 48 hours, we first need to find the individual hourly production rates for each flavor. The factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, which translates to a rate of 50 quarts per hour (100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts/hour).  Similarly, the vanilla ice cream production rate is 12.5 quarts per hour (50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour).

Combining these rates, the factory produces a total of 62.5 quarts per hour (50 quarts/hour + 12.5 quarts/hour = 62.5 quarts/hour).  

Finally, over 48 hours, the total production would be 3000 quarts (62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts).

"Let's break down Lorraine's sticker-button trading spree.

* **Small Stickers to Large Buttons:** Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers, which is 27 stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 small buttons. She can then trade these 27 small buttons for 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9).

* **Large Stickers to Large Buttons:** Lorraine trades half of her 40 large stickers, resulting in 20 large buttons.

* **Remaining Large Stickers to Small Buttons:** Lorraine has 20 large stickers remaining. She trades these for 60 small buttons (20 * 3 = 60).

* **Total Buttons:** Adding up all her buttons, Lorraine has 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the votes in favor were twice the number of votes against.  If we represent the votes against as 'x', then the votes in favor would be '2x'. The total number of votes is the sum of these, so x + 2x = 33. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33.  Dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 11.  

Since the votes in favor were 2x, there were 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

"Let's break down this shingle situation.  We know the three houses require a total of 250 cases.  

Let's use algebra to represent the unknown quantities:

*  Let 'x' be the number of cases the second house needs.
* The first house needs half the amount of the second house, so it needs x/2 cases.
* The third house needs double the amount of the first house, meaning it needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total number of cases:

x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining like terms, we get: 2.5x = 250

Finally, divide both sides by 2.5 to solve for x: x = 100

Since the third house needs 'x' cases, it will require 100 cases of shingles.

Bob begins with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. He buys an additional 17 fish, and afterwards, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let 'w' represent the number of white fish Bob purchased. This means he bought (17 - w) orange fish.

After the purchase, his fish counts are:

* Orange: 3 + (17 - w)
* White: 4 + w

We know the number of orange fish is double the number of white fish, so we can set up the equation:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Simplifying the equation:

20 - w = 8 + 2w

Combining like terms:

12 = 3w

Solving for 'w':

w = 4



Therefore, Bob bought **4** white fish at the store.

"Let's break down this arcade scenario.

First, we need to figure out how long each friend can play per quarter. Jack gets 20 minutes per quarter. His two less-skilled friends get half that time, meaning 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter. His more skilled friend gets 1.5 times Jack's time, so 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter.

Next, we need to convert the total playtime into minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

Now we can calculate how many quarters each person needs:

* **Jack:** 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters
* **Worse friends:** 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters each, totaling 24 * 2 = 48 quarters
* **Better friend:** 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters

Finally, add up the quarters and multiply by the cost per quarter: (12 + 48 + 8) quarters * $0.25/quarter = $17.00

"Let's break down this problem step by step.  We know the total scrub volume is 10 ounces.  

Let's represent the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance, since they're equal) as 'x'.  

* Salt and sugar each equal twice the amount of zest, so they are each '2x' ounces.

* Oil is twice the amount of salt, making it '4x' ounces.

The total amount of each ingredient is: x + x + 2x + 2x + 4x = 10 ounces

Combining like terms, we get 10x = 10 ounces.

Solving for x, we find x = 1 ounce.

Therefore, Tanya uses 4x = 4 ounces of oil.

"Let's break this problem down algebraically. 

* Let 'x' represent the number of cards PJ has.
* Smendrick has three times the number of cards PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards.
* Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329. Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

They also charge $0.08 per mile, and the distribution center is 20 miles away, resulting in a mileage cost of $0.08 * 20 = $1.60.  The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Next, we need to figure out how much Amazon will refund Milly. They refund 75% of the book's price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, to find Milly's total loss, we subtract the refund and shipping cost from the original price: $32 - $24 - $3 = $5.00.

"Let's calculate Kelly's remaining budget. 

First, we find the cost of each chicken packet: $10 (bacon cost) / 5 packs = $2 per pack of bacon. Since each chicken packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, each chicken packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.

The total cost of the chicken is $4/packet * 6 packets = $24.

Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so they cost $4 (strawberry price) / 2 = $2 per pack. The total cost of the apples is $2/pack * 7 packs = $14.

The strawberries cost $4/pack * 3 packs = $12.

Adding up all the costs, we get $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Therefore, Kelly has $65 (budget) - $60 (total cost) = $5 left in her budget.

"Let's break down this problem.  

First, we need to find the total cost of the CDs before the discount. That's 10 CDs * $15/CD = $150.

The discount is 40% of the original price, so we calculate $150 * 0.40 = $60.

Subtracting the discount, James pays $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sells 5 CDs for $40 each, earning him 5 CDs * $40/CD = $200.

Finally, to find out how much money James is ""out,"" we subtract his expenses from his earnings: $200 - $90 = $110.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, covering a distance of 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

At a speed of 2 miles per hour, this initial leg takes him 12 miles / 2 mph = 6 hours.

He then rests for half this time, meaning 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours of rest on the island.

With 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles remaining, and swimming at half his original speed (1 mph), the final leg takes 8 miles / 1 mph = 8 hours.

Adding up all the time segments, his total travel time is 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.

"Let's denote the number of points Azibo scored as 'x'.  Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo, meaning Bahati scored x + 20 points. Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, so Dinar scored x + 20 - 10 = x + 10 points.

The total points scored by the three is 45, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45. Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15. Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 5.



Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

First, convert the cooling time to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Next, add up all the time components: 20 minutes (batter) + 30 minutes (baking) + 120 minutes (cooling) + 10 minutes (frosting) = 180 minutes.

Finally, convert the total time back to hours: 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours.

Subtracting this preparation time from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm gives us a start time of 2:00 pm.

"To determine the number of chocolate bars per box, we can use the following logic:

Lisa and Peter sold a combined total of 8 boxes (3.5 + 4.5).  Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in total, we can find the number of bars per box by dividing the total bars by the total boxes: 64 bars / 8 boxes = 8 bars per box.

"Let's break down the dance studio's earnings.  

They charge a flat $25 per session for studio rental and an additional $1.50 per student. With 10 students, that's $1.50 * 10 = $15 per session for the students.

Adding the rental fee, each session costs $25 + $15 = $40.

Since they hold sessions 3 days a week, their weekly earnings are $40/session * 3 sessions/week = $120.

Finally, assuming a month has 4 weeks, their expected monthly earnings are $120/week * 4 weeks/month = $480.

* **Male students over 16:** One-fourth of the students over 16 are male, meaning there are 1500 students * (1/4) = 375 male students over 16.

* **Female students over 16:**  This means there are 1500 students - 375 students = 1125 female students over 16.

* **Students under 16:** The other half of the student body is under 16, so there are also 1500 students under 16.

* **Male students under 16:** Half of the students under 16 are male, meaning there are 1500 students * (1/2) = 750 male students under 16.

* **Female students under 16:** This leaves 1500 students - 750 students = 750 female students under 16.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

The power bank loses charge at different rates, so we need to consider each period separately.

* **First 5 hours:** A 9% loss per hour for 5 hours results in a total loss of 45% (9% * 5 = 45%).

* **Next 3 hours:** A 7% loss per hour for 3 hours results in a total loss of 21% (7% * 3 = 21%).

* **Total loss:** The total charge lost is 66% (45% + 21%).

* **Charge remaining after losses:** This means 34% of the original charge remained (100% - 66% = 34%).

* **Charge used by friends:** The difference between the charge remaining after losses (34%) and the final charge (28%) is 6% (34% - 28% = 6%). This 6% represents the charge used by Maria's friends.

* **Original charge:** Since the 6% used by friends was part of the 34% remaining after the initial losses, we can set up a proportion: 6% / 34% = x / 100%. Solving for x, we find that the original charge was approximately 17.65%.

"Let's break down Jamaar's fruit-buying spree.  

First, we need to find the total cost of the fruit he's already chosen:

* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

Adding those up, his current total is $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25.

This leaves him with $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 for plums.

Since each plum costs $0.25, he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Let's break down this problem.  We know Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, which are $4 each. This means large stuffed animals cost $12.

Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold. She sold twice as many small stuffed animals, meaning she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Her earnings from large stuffed animals would be 12x, and her earnings from small stuffed animals would be 8x.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know the total time to make the meal was 98 minutes, and Betsy took 18 minutes longer than Donovan.  

We can represent Donovan's time as ""x"" and Betsy's time as ""x + 18"".  The sum of their times equals the total time:

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combining like terms, we get:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

This means Donovan took 40 minutes. Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

First, we need to find the total area of the walls. The north and south walls each have an area of 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, they contribute a total of 80 square feet * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls each have an area of 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet. With two of these walls, they add another 40 square feet * 2 = 80 square feet.

Adding the areas of all the walls, we get a total paintable area of 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so we'll need 240 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

"Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the combined output of the four workers who are already producing toys. Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so they produce a total of 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.  The other two workers produce 4 toys per hour each, for a total of 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.

Over a 10-hour shift, these four workers produce a total of (12 + 8) * 10 = 200 toys.

Since the manufacturer needs 400 toys and still needs 20 more after the other workers' shift, the fifth worker needs to produce 400 - 20 - 200 = 180 toys.

Therefore, the fifth worker must produce 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

* **Camden and Sarah's Eggs:** We know Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  Let's use algebra to solve for their individual contributions. Let 'x' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted. Camden painted x + 12 eggs.  The equation becomes: x + (x + 12) = 30.

* **Solving for Sarah's Eggs:** Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 12 = 30. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 2x = 18. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that Sarah painted 9 eggs.

* **Camden's Eggs:** Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, he painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

* **Arnold and Madeline's Eggs:** Together, Arnold and Madeline painted the remaining eggs: 56 - 30 = 26 eggs.

* **Arnold's Eggs:**  Because Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, each painted 26 / 2 = 13 eggs.

* **The Difference:** Finally, Camden painted 21 - 13 = 8 more eggs than Arnold.

"Let's break this problem down.  

First, we need to figure out how many boxes Nik will need. Since he has 200 crayons and wants to put 8 in each box, he'll need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.

Next, we know the crayons weigh 200 ounces total (200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon). The boxes themselves weigh another 200 ounces (25 boxes * 8 ounces/box).

That means the total weight is 200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces.

Finally, we convert ounces to pounds: 400 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds.

Since their mother earns twice their combined salary, she makes $15000 * 2 = $30000 per month.

"Here's how to break down this problem:

Let's denote Grandma's speed on the beach as 'b' miles per hour.  Since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk, her sidewalk speed is '2b' miles per hour.

We know she covers 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, which translates to 2/3 of an hour.  Therefore, her beach speed is:

b = 2 miles / (2/3 hour) = 3 miles per hour

Her sidewalk speed is then 2b = 6 miles per hour.

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, the time spent on the sidewalk is:

1 mile / 6 miles per hour = 1/6 hour = 10 minutes

Her total walking time is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the sidewalk:

40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes

"Let's break down this problem. Donny needs the water to be at least 40 degrees to drink it.  We know one mug is 33 degrees, and the other is unknown.  

The key is that mixing the two waters will result in a temperature somewhere between the two starting temperatures. Since the final mixture needs to be at least 40 degrees, the unknown mug must be significantly warmer than 40 degrees to compensate for the cooler water.

Here's the logic:

* The 33-degree water will lower the overall temperature of the mix.
* The unknown water needs to be hot enough to raise the temperature above 40 degrees after mixing.

Considering the small amount of water being mixed (4 ounces from the cooler mug and 1 ounce from the warmer mug), the unknown mug must be considerably warmer than 40 degrees to achieve the desired temperature.

Therefore, the second bottle must be at least 68 degrees.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

First, we need to determine Faraday's total earnings from sunflowers per day. He sells individual sunflowers for $2 each and earns $56 from bouquets containing 12 sunflowers, meaning each sunflower in a bouquet contributes $56 / 12 = $4.67 to his earnings.  This brings his total earnings per sunflower per day to $2 + $4.67 = $6.67.

Over three days, his total earnings from sunflowers would be $6.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $20.01/sunflower.

Since he earned a total of $26 from individual sunflowers and $56 from bouquets, totaling $82 over three days, he sold $82 / $6.67 per sunflower = 12.29 sunflowers.

Since he can't sell fractions of sunflowers, Faraday sold **12** sunflowers after three days.

"Let's break down this problem step by step.

We're given the following information:

* The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.
* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
* The total length of all three ropes is 37 centimeters.

Let's use variables to represent the lengths:

*  Red rope: *r*
*  Blue rope: *b*
*  Yellow rope: *y*

We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:

1. *r = 4b* 
2. *b = y - 7*
3. *r + b + y = 37*

Now we can solve for *r*, the length of the red rope.

Substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate *b*:

*r = 4(y - 7)*

Simplify:

*r = 4y - 28*

Substitute both the simplified equation for *r* and the equation for *b* into the third equation:

*(4y - 28) + (y - 7) + y = 37*

Combine like terms:

*6y - 35 = 37*

Add 35 to both sides:

*6y = 72*

Divide both sides by 6:

*y = 12*

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (*y* = 12), substitute it back into the equation *b = y - 7* to find the length of the blue rope:

*b = 12 - 7*
*b = 5*

Finally, substitute the value of *b* into the equation *r = 4b* to find the length of the red rope:

*r = 4 * 5*
*r = 20*

In the first half, Team A scores 4 goals, and Team B scores 2 fewer, meaning they score 2 goals.  

During the second half, Team B quadruples their first-half score, netting 8 goals. Team A scores a quarter of Team B's second-half total, which is 2 goals.

Adding up the goals for each team, Team A scores a total of 6 goals (4 + 2), and Team B scores 10 goals (2 + 8).

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 16.

"Let's break this problem down. After Monday's heavy use, the teacher has 55% of the chalk remaining, which is 2.75 inches (5 inches * 0.55).  He uses 20% of the chalk per day, meaning he uses 1 inch of chalk every 5 days (5 inches * 0.20 = 1 inch).

Therefore, the teacher can use the remaining chalk for 2.75 days / (1 inch / 5 days) = 2.75 * 5 = 13.75 days. Since he can't use a piece smaller than 2 inches, he has **2** full days before he needs to recycle the chalk.

"Here's how to solve this:

First, find the number of girls on varsity: (1/3) * 12 girls = 4 girls.

Next, find the number of boys on varsity: (1/4) * 12 boys = 3 boys.

This means a total of 4 + 3 = 7 students are on varsity.

Since there are 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students in total,  24 - 7 = 17 students are not on varsity.

"Let's break down this age word problem. We'll use variables to represent the ages:

* Let Wendy's current age be ""w""
* Let Colin's current age be ""c""

We're given two key pieces of information:

1. **Future Age Relationship:** Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. This translates to the equation:  w = 5(c + 7)

2. **Future Age Relationship (2):** In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. This gives us: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we have a system of two equations:

* w = 5c + 35
* c + 25 = (1/3)w

Let's solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.  We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to eliminate ""w"":

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20



Colin is currently 20 years old.

"Let's break down the pizza problem.  

Kate needs enough pizza for her 6 friends, with each friend wanting 6 slices of cheese and 4 slices of pepperoni. That's a total of 10 slices per friend (6 + 4 = 10).

In total, they need 60 slices (6 friends * 10 slices/friend = 60 slices).

Since the cheese pizzas are cut into 12 slices each, Kate needs 5 cheese pizzas (60 slices / 12 slices/pizza = 5 pizzas).

Similarly, she needs 7.5 pepperoni pizzas (60 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 7.5 pizzas).

Since you can't buy half a pizza, Kate needs to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas.

Therefore, Kate needs to buy a total of 13 pizzas (5 cheese + 8 pepperoni = 13 pizzas).

Josh services 3 cars per day and is open 5 days a week (7 days - 2 days). This means he services 15 cars weekly (3 cars/day * 5 days/week).  

At $4 per car, his weekly earnings are $60 (15 cars * $4/car). Over two weeks, he would make $120 ( $60/week * 2 weeks).

"Let's break down this problem. Matthew has 12 toy soldiers.  He's selling half at $5 each, which would be 6 toys * $5/toy = $30. The other half are selling for $7 each, so that's another 6 toys * $7/toy = $42.  Adding those together, Matthew would earn a total of $30 + $42 = $72.

"Let's break this problem down. The dog digs a total of 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes while Nate is away.  Each day, Nate fills 9 holes but the dog digs 6 more, resulting in a net decrease of 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day.  Therefore, it will take Nate 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days to fill all the holes. This equates to 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

"To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, we need to subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.  

7995 (total cookies) - 2595 (rainbow cookies) - 3075 (oatmeal cookies) = 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Let's break down the problem to find the solution.

Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, but Igor only brought 16 / 2 = 8. Igor brought 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes, which is two more than requested.  

We know Igor placed a total of 29 items on the bench, and we know he brought the correct number of beakers (7).  

Therefore, the total number of items Igor brought was 8 + 7 + 16 = 31. Since he only placed 29 on the bench, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 items.

Since he didn't lose any test tubes or Petri dishes, he must have lost 2 beakers.

"Let's break this down. James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, meaning each table requires 2 screws/leg * 4 legs/table = 8 screws.  With 4 tables, he'll need a total of 8 screws/table * 4 tables = 32 screws. Since he has 40 screws, he'll have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws leftover.

"Let's break this down. If one basket has 10 eggs, and the second basket has twice that amount, the second basket contains 10 * 2 = 20 eggs.  In total, there are 10 + 20 = 30 eggs in both baskets.

"To find the total amount raised, we need to calculate each girl's earnings and then sum them up. 

* Alexandra raises $430.
* Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so she raises $430 + $320 = $750.
* Sarah raises $300.
* Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, so she raises $300 + $400 = $700.

Therefore, the total amount raised is $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"Let's break this problem down.  We know Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, meaning for every mile Vanessa runs, Aaron runs two.  Conversely, Vanessa runs twice the distance Aaron does.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles. We're told Aaron completed his 2 miles in 16 minutes, meaning his pace was 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile.

Because Aaron runs twice as fast, Vanessa takes twice as long to run each mile, putting her pace at 8 minutes/mile * 2 = 16 minutes per mile.

Finally, Vanessa's total time is 4 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 64 minutes.

"Let's break down the restaurant's earnings:

Each reservation generates $15 in revenue (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). With 6 reservations per night, they make $90 per night.  Since they're open two nights a week, their total weekly revenue is $180.

"Here's how to determine the selling price of each watermelon:

First, calculate the total profit: 25% of $80 is (0.25) * $80 = $20.

Next, find the total selling price by adding the profit to the original cost: $80 + $20 = $100.

Finally, divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons to get the price per watermelon: $100 / 50 = $2.

"Let's break down this age problem step by step.

* Dora is turning 12 in three years, meaning she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
* James is twice Dora's age, making him 9 * 2 = 18 years old.
* John was 19 when James was born, so he is currently 18 + 19 = 37 years old.
* John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.
* In three years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

"Let's break this down.  

Ana peels oranges at a rate of one orange every 3 minutes, while Jane takes 4 minutes per orange.  In an hour (60 minutes), Ana can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges. Jane, on the other hand, can peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Let's calculate Mark's total expenses.

First, we need to determine the discounted price of the radiator: $400 * 0.80 = $320 off.

This means the radiator cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, totaling $50 * 3 = $150.

Therefore, Mark's total cost was $80 + $150 = $230.

"Let's use a system of equations to solve this problem.  

* Let 'c' represent the number of chickens.
* Let 'w' represent the number of cows.

We know the following:

* **Equation 1:** c + w = 20 (The total number of animals is 20)
* **Equation 2:** 2c + 4w = 70 (The total number of legs is 70)

We can solve for 'c' (the number of chickens) using substitution.

1. Solve Equation 1 for 'w': w = 20 - c
2. Substitute this value of 'w' into Equation 2: 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
3. Simplify and solve for 'c': 2c + 80 - 4c = 70 => -2c = -10 => c = 5



There are **5** chickens.
