"
"Alright, let's break this down. Josh spent a total of $130,000 ($80,000 for the house + $50,000 for repairs).  The repairs increased the value by 150%, meaning the house is now worth $200,000 ($80,000 x 1.50 = $120,000 increase + $80,000 original value).  

That means he made a profit of $70,000 ($200,000 selling price - $130,000 investment).

$70,000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, he runs 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters each day.  Then, over a whole week, he runs 180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed a day, and she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. That's a total of 40 cups. Since she has 20 chickens and they each need 3 cups, she needs a total of 60 cups.  

So, she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times that amount, then Charleston has 20 * 4 = 80 sheep. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 * 2 = 160 sheep.  

Adding them all up, Seattle's 20 + Charleston's 80 + Toulouse's 160 equals a total of 260 sheep.

"Alright, let's break this down. Carla hits a snag with that big download!

She gets 40% of the way through, which is 80 GB, before Windows throws a wrench in the works with those pesky updates. That takes 20 minutes, and she has to start all over.

So, she downloads 80 GB in 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes).  Then she's got 120 GB left to download, which takes another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes).

Add it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

It takes Carla a total of **120 minutes** to download the file. 



"
"Alright, let's figure this out. John drives 180 miles out (3 hours * 60 mph). Then he hits traffic and doesn't move for 2 hours. After that, he crawls along for half an hour at 30 mph, covering 15 miles.  That leaves him with 1.5 hours to drive at 80 mph, which means he covers another 120 miles (1.5 hours * 80 mph).

Adding up his return trip, he's covered 135 miles (15 miles + 120 miles).  

Since he drove 180 miles out, he's 45 miles from home.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings.

She makes $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime, and her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding that to her regular pay, Eliza earned a total of $400 + $60 = $460 this week. 


$460
"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The program had 60 downloads the first month.  The second month it tripled that to 180 downloads. Then, in the third month, those downloads went down by 30%, meaning they lost 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. That leaves 180 - 54 = 126 downloads for the third month.

Adding it all up: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 total downloads.

"Hey there! Let's break down Toula's bakery haul. 

* Those 3 dozen donuts at $68 a dozen cost her $204.
* The 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 a dozen add up to $160.
* And those 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 a dozen come to $330.

Adding it all together, Toula spent a total of $694 at the bakery. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

It costs $3 a year to keep the tree going, but Carlos makes $10.50 selling the lemons. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 each year. To make back the $90 it cost to plant, it'll take him 12 years.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.  

Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.  Think about it in reverse:

* **Before the orange house:** She had double the amount she has now, plus 1, so 5 * 2 + 1 = 11 vacuum cleaners.
* **Before the red house:** She had 2 more than that, so 11 + 2 = 13 vacuum cleaners.
* **Before the green house:** She had three times the amount she had before the red house, so 13 * 3 = 39 vacuum cleaners.

So Melanie started with 39 vacuum cleaners. 



"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.  

So, 20% of the students are into contemporary dance, which means there are 20 * 0.20 = 4 contemporary dancers. That leaves 20 - 4 = 16 students.

Then, 25% of those remaining students like jazz, so there are 16 * 0.25 = 4 jazz dancers.

That means 16 - 4 = 12 students are into hip-hop.

To find the percentage, we do (12 / 20) * 100% = 60%.

So the answer is 60%. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's see, the merchant wants to make the most money, right?  

The jewelry will go up by $5000 * 0.025 = $125.

The gadgets will only go up by $8000 * 0.012 = $96.

So, the merchant should buy the jewelry to make the biggest profit.

**Answer:** $125 



"
"Hey there!  

Let me see... they each travel 80 miles west, then 150 miles north.  To find the total distance, we just add those together: 80 + 150 = 230 miles.

So the answer is 230. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break down Jill's earnings.

She makes $20 an hour teaching and works 35 hours a week doing that, so that's $20 * 35 = $700 per week from teaching.

As a cheer coach, she earns $30 an hour for 15 hours a week, bringing in $30 * 15 = $450 per week.

Adding those together, she makes $700 + $450 = $1150 each week.

Over a year, with 50 weeks of work, her total salary is $1150 * 50 = $57500.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Marissa wants to average 4 miles per hour over the whole 12-mile hike.  She's already walked 6 miles in 2 hours. That means she has 6 miles left and only 1 hour to do it.  To figure out her needed speed, we divide the distance by the time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

She needs to pick up the pace!

**Answer:** 6 



"
"Hey there! Let me see... you've got 10 liters of orange drink, which is mostly water, and you're mixing it with some pineapple drink.  You spill a bit, but we can still figure out how much water is in the final mix.

First, the orange drink has 6.67 liters of water in it (10 liters * 2/3 = 6.67 liters). The pineapple drink has 9 liters of water (15 liters * 3/5 = 9 liters).

After the spill, you have 9 liters of orange drink left.  Adding that to the pineapple drink, you get a total of 15.67 liters of water.



"
"Alright, let's break this down. Samantha is 31, and Raymond is older by 6 years, making him 37. Raymond had his son when he was 23, so his son is currently 37 - 23 = 14 years old.  That means Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If $19.50 is 75% of the original price (because of that 25% discount), we can set up a simple equation.  

Divide $19.50 by 0.75, and you'll get the original price.

$19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Marie spent $12 on chicken, $15 on milk (5 packs x $3), and $6 on apples (4 apples x $1.50), for a total of $33. That means the pizza cost $17 ($50 - $33). Since each pizza box is $8.50, she must have bought 2 boxes ($17 / $8.50).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Mishka spent. 

Three pairs of shorts at $16.50 each is $49.50. Three pairs of pants at $22.50 each is $67.50. And three pairs of shoes at $42 each is $126.00.  

Adding those all up, Mishka spent a total of $243.00 on clothes. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, so that's 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).  Since each carton costs $4.00, she'll spend $16.00 in total (4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00).


16.00 

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... Henry biked 20 miles to his first stop, and his second stop was 15 miles from the end of his 60-mile trip. That means his second stop was at mile 45.  So, he biked 45 - 20 = 25 miles between stops.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, meaning their ages are like parts of a whole. If their combined age is 162, we need to figure out how big each ""part"" is.

Think of it like this: 7 + 11 = 18 parts make up their total age.

So, each ""part"" is worth 162 / 18 = 9 years.

Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the first friend guesses 80 jelly beans. The second friend says 20 more than half of that, which is 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans. The third friend guesses 25% more than the first friend, which is 80 * 0.25 = 20 more jelly beans, making their guess 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average, we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide by the number of guesses: 240 / 3 = 80.

The average guess is 80 jelly beans.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If John spends half an hour on each of his 10 furry friends, that's 5 hours a day of dog duty.  Since there are 7 days in a week, he spends a total of 35 hours taking care of those pups!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's call this number ""s""
* **Gold coins:** This would be ""s + 30""

Since she has 110 coins total, we can add those together: s + (s + 30) = 110

Combining like terms, we get 2s + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides: 2s = 80

Divide both sides by 2: s = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  

To find the gold coins, we add 30: 40 + 30 = 70

Gretchen has 70 gold coins. 


70
"
"Alright, let's break this down. Raymond's got 40 jewels, and Aaron has 5 more than half of that. So Aaron has 20 (half of 40) + 5 = 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer than Aaron, meaning she has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels. 


23
"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more than that, which is 1 extra point. So, he scores 5 points in the second half.  That means he scores a total of 9 points.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he'll eat 2 * 30 = 60 yogurts. Since the yogurts come in packs of 4 for $5, he'll need 60 / 4 = 15 packs. That means he'll spend 15 * $5 = $75.00 on yogurt. 


$75.00 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. John made 13 sets * $15/set = $195 from his Legos.  He spent $160 on games, and had $5 leftover, meaning he had $165 before buying games. That means he sold $165 / $15/set = 11 Lego sets. Since he started with 13, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.

2 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  John runs a total of 60 miles each week. He runs 3 days a week, with one day being 3 hours long. The other two days are half that time, so 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours each. That means he runs 1.5 hours * 2 days = 3 hours on those shorter days.

Adding it all up, he runs for 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours a week.

To find his speed, we divide his total miles by his total time: 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

So John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. 


10
"
"Alright, let's break this down. Dana's a speedy one!  

If she skips at 3 miles per hour and that's half her running speed, she must run at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours). That means she covers 12 miles running (6 mph * 2 hours) and 6 miles walking (1.5 mph * 4 hours).

Adding those up, Dana travels a total of 18 miles.

"
"Let's see... Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet normally. With the gemstone, she can throw it three times that distance, so that's 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since the dragon's fire only reaches 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet away and still hit it.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... Grandma baked 5 pies with 8 slices each, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 slices total. If there were 14 left, then the guests ate 40 - 14 = 26 slices.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  You've got 200 calories left and each serving of chips is 250 calories. That means you can only have 0.8 servings. Since a bag has 5 servings and weighs 300 grams, one serving is 60 grams. So, you can eat 0.8 servings * 60 grams/serving = 48 grams of chips. 


48 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Charlie's got a good idea with those beeswax candles!

He needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles (20 candles / 10 candles per pound = 2 pounds). That'll cost him $20.00 in supplies (2 pounds * $10.00 per pound = $20.00).

If he sells all 20 candles at $2.00 each, he'll rake in $40.00 (20 candles * $2.00 per candle = $40.00).

So, his profit is $20.00 ($40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00). 


$20.00
"
"Alright, let's break this down. Meredith's got a busy schedule!

* On Tuesday, she wrote 5 articles + (2/5 * 5 articles) = 7 articles.
* Wednesday was a big day, with 7 articles * 2 = 14 articles.
* That's a total of 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles over the three days.
* Since each article takes 4 hours, she spent 26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours writing.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes and used 220, leaving her with 23.  To figure out how many were in the package, we gotta do a little math.

She used a total of 80 + 220 = 300 Post-it notes.

Since she had 23 left over, she must have bought a package with 300 - 23 = 277 Post-it notes.


277 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. John snagged 5 blue ties since he spent $200 and they cost $40 each.  He's got double the red ties, so that's 10 red ones.  Those red ties are pricier, 50% more than the blue ones, making them $60 a pop.  So, the red ties cost him $600 (10 ties * $60/tie).  Adding that to the $200 he spent on blue ties, his total tie bill comes to $800. 


$800
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet: that's 4 times 12, which is 48 inches.

Then, we divide the total inches (48) by the length of each piece (6 inches): 48 / 6 = 8.

Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we gotta see how many eggs Lloyd gets in a week: 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs.

Then, we divide that by 12 to see how many dozens he has: 1764 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozen.

Finally, multiply that by his price per dozen: 147 dozen * $2/dozen = $294.

So Lloyd makes $294 a week from his eggs. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down. Tom travels for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, covering a distance of 30 miles.  On the way back, he's going slower at 6 miles per hour.  To find out how long that takes, we divide the distance by his speed: 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.

"
"Let's see... Uriah needs to take out 15 pounds total. His comic books weigh a quarter pound each, and he's getting rid of 30 of them, so that's 7.5 pounds right there (30 x 0.25 = 7.5).  That means he needs to take out another 7.5 pounds of toys (15 - 7.5 = 7.5). Since each toy weighs half a pound, he needs to remove 15 toys (7.5 / 0.5 = 15).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

On Thursday, the mechanic made $60 x 6 = $360 from truck tires and $40 x 4 = $160 from car tires, for a total of $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic made $40 x 12 = $480 from car tires.

The mechanic earned $520 - $480 = $40 more on Thursday.

"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for you. Marcy gets a base pension of $50,000 a year. After 20 years, she starts getting an extra 5% of that each year. Since she quits after 30 years, she'll get the bonus for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10). That bonus is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.  So, her total pension will be $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500 per year.


$52,500 

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Aleena pays $140 a month for the first six months, so that's $140 * 6 = $840.

For the next six months, she gets a 10% discount, which is $140 * 0.10 = $14 off her monthly bill. That means she pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month.

So for the last six months, she pays $126 * 6 = $756.

Adding up both halves of the year, her total cost is $840 + $756 = $1596.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Sophia got 100 miles out of 4 gallons, so her car gets 25 miles per gallon (100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 MPG). Since her tank holds 12 gallons, she can drive 300 miles on a full tank (25 MPG * 12 gallons = 300 miles).

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Tommy raises. He sells brownies for $3 each and cheesecakes for $4 a slice.  He sells 43 brownies, so that's 43 * $3 = $129. He also sells 23 slices of cheesecake, which brings in 23 * $4 = $92.  Adding those together, Tommy raises a total of $129 + $92 = $221.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Shiela's buying five phones at $150 each, so that's 5 * $150 = $750.  

Now, there's a 2% interest charge per phone, meaning an extra $150 * 0.02 = $3 per phone.

Since she's getting five phones, the total interest is $3 * 5 = $15.

Adding the interest to the original price, she'll pay a total of $750 + $15 = $765.

Finally, spread out over three months, her monthly payment will be $765 / 3 = $255.


Let me know if you have any other questions!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Artie makes.

He's selling marigolds for $3 a pot, petunias for $2 a pot, and begonias for $2 a pot.

* He sells 12 marigolds: 12 * $3 = $36
* He sells 9 petunias: 9 * $2 = $18
* He sells 17 begonias: 17 * $2 = $34

Adding it all up: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet

Finally, divide the total by the number of levels to find the average: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The puppy eats 1 cup a day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups right there. Then it eats 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is another 370 cups (2 cups/day * 185 days).

That's a total of 550 cups for the whole year. Since each bag has 110 cups, Cecilia will need 5 bags.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half that, he's doing 400 / 2 = 200 pounds.  Now, Sarah does 4 times the laundry David does, meaning David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds.  That means Raymond does 200 - 100 = 100 pounds more laundry than David.

"
"Hey there! This is Victor.  

Let's see... they played 22 games total, and won 8 more than they lost.  To figure out how many they won, we can think of it like this:

If they lost 'x' games, they won 'x + 8' games.

Since the total games are 22, we have: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Dividing both sides by 2: x = 7

So they lost 7 games.  That means they won 7 + 8 = 15 games!

"Hey there! Let me break this down for you. Sylvie's salary will increase by 10% each year after her fifth year.  

* After one year, her salary will be $600 + ($600 * 0.10) = $660.
* After two years, it'll be $660 + ($660 * 0.10) = $726.
* And after three years, it'll be $726 + ($726 * 0.10) = $798.60.


So, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years will be $798.60.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Marilyn sold 10 times more than Harald, think of it like this: Harald's sales are one ""part,"" and Marilyn's are ten ""parts."" That makes a total of eleven ""parts"" representing the 88,000 copies sold.

To find out how many copies are in one ""part"" (Harald's sales), we divide the total copies by the total ""parts"": 88,000 copies / 11 parts = 8,000 copies per part.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Adults eat 10 pounds each, and there are 20 adults, so that's 10 * 20 = 200 pounds of potato salad right there.

Kids eat half as much, so they'll eat 10 / 2 = 5 pounds each. With 5 kids, that's 5 * 5 = 25 pounds.

In total, Ted needs 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad.

"Alright, let's break this down. Lee is speedy, finishing the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Gerald was a bit slower, but he's been working hard! His new diet shaved 10% off his time.  Since Lee was 2 seconds faster than Gerald originally, Gerald must have taken 40 seconds to run the hurdles. A 10% improvement on that is 4 seconds. So, with his new diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds!

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  If there are 60 dogs and twice as many cats, that's 60 * 2 = 120 cats.  That means there are 60 + 120 = 180 dogs and cats altogether.

Since there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding it all up, there are 168 + 180 = 348 pets in the neighborhood.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, that means there are 80 boys (2/5 * 200 = 80).  That leaves 120 girls (200 - 80 = 120).

If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts, then 80 girls are Scouts (2/3 * 120 = 80). That means 40 girls aren't in the Girl Scouts (120 - 80 = 40).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times. The third friend rang it 10 more times than that, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 rings. The second friend rang it 1/4 more times than the first friend, who rang it 20 times. That means the second friend rang it 20 * (1/4) = 5 more times, for a total of 20 + 5 = 25 rings.

Adding up all the rings, we get 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 rings.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Each box has walls that are 1 inch thick, so we gotta figure out the space inside.  

Think of it like this: the outside of each box is 5 by 6 by 4 inches, but the inside is smaller by 2 inches in each direction. So, the inside of each box is 3 by 4 by 2 inches.

To find the volume of one box, we multiply those inside measurements: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has three boxes, the total inner volume is 24 x 3 = 72 cubic inches.

"Alright, let's break this down. Julia's boat is taking on water at a rate of 2 liters every 10 feet.  She rows at a speed of 20 feet in 16 seconds, meaning she covers 1.25 feet per second. To reach the shore, it takes her 64 seconds, so she rows a total of 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

Since she travels 80 feet, and the boat takes on 2 liters every 10 feet, it takes on a total of 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Sasha's got some leftover lumber she wants to sell.  

Those 2x4s cost her $10 each, and she's got ten of them. That's $100 right there. The 4x4s were $16 each, and she has five, so that's another $80.  

Now, lumber prices went up 50%, so she can sell those 2x4s for $15 each and the 4x4s for $24 each.

Let's see... ten 2x4s at $15 each is $150. And five 4x4s at $24 each is $120.

So, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270 in total.

Subtract her original cost of $180, and she makes a profit of $90.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

Katy's sugar and water ratio is 7:13, meaning for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.  If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined, we need to find out how much of that 120 is sugar.

Think of it like this: the ratio 7:13 represents 20 total parts (7 + 13 = 20).  Each of those parts is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the sugar part of the ratio is 7, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Adrien's salary was a third more than Lylah's, meaning if Lylah made $100, Adrien made $130.  We know Adrien was making $40,000 four years ago, so that means Lylah was making $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately) four years ago.

Fast forward four years, Adrien's salary jumped by 40%, bringing his total to $40,000 + ($40,000 * 0.40) = $56,000. Lylah's salary also increased, so she's now making $30,769.23 + ($30,769.23 * 0.30) = $40,000.

Adding their salaries together, we get $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  With 4 more nights, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, a watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, and a pepper is $15. That means a watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

An orange is $5 cheaper than a watermelon, so it's $45 - $5 = $40.

Dillon's buying 4 watermelons, so that's 4 * $45 = $180.

He's getting 20 peppers, which will cost 20 * $15 = $300.

And for the oranges, 10 of them will be 10 * $40 = $400.

Adding it all up: $180 + $300 + $400 = $880.

Dillon's gonna spend $880 at the store.

"Hey there! This beehive problem is buzzing with numbers! Let's break it down.

We know there are 700 bees total.  There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens.  

Think of it like this: if we have a group of queens, there are double that number of babies, and then double the babies again for the worker bees.

To figure out how many worker bees there are, we need to think in groups. Let's say there's 1 queen. That means there are 2 baby bees, and then 4 worker bees.

If we keep going like this, we can figure out how many groups of 7 (1 queen + 2 babies + 4 workers) fit into 700 bees.

700 divided by 7 is 100. So there are 100 groups of bees!

That means there are 100 queens, 200 babies, and 400 worker bees.

John spent $2 on milk and $3 on eggs, so his food cost is $5.  He spent $3 on light bulbs, $3 on cups, and $4 on roach traps, for a total of $10 on non-food stuff.  Since there's a 10% tax on those, that's another $1.  So the non-food stuff cost him $11.

Adding it all up, John spent $5 + $11 = $16.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Kim's profit.

He's got 8 clients total (3 + 5).  Each client needs $4 worth of bleach (2 bottles x $2) and $5 worth of cloths, for a total of $9 per client.

That means his total expenses are 8 clients * $9/client = $72.

Since he's making $92 each week, his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. John has a lot of pineapples! 

He gets 1000 pineapples each time he harvests (10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare). Since he harvests every 3 months, that means he harvests 4 times a year (12 months / 3 months/harvest).

So, in a year, he'll have 4000 pineapples (1000 pineapples/harvest * 4 harvests).


4000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The bigger set has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces. The smallest set has 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.

That means Johnny picks up a total of 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 Lego pieces. 

2125

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Debra saw 30 bees leave at first. Then 15 came back (half of the first group).  Then 60 more flew out (double the first group). That means a total of 90 bees left the hive during the day. Since they all came back eventually, 90 bees returned in the last 6 hours.

"Alright, let's break this down. Steve's got a head start with that bike, but Tim's gotta be quick on that skateboard!

First, we gotta figure out how long each dude takes to get home. Steve's going 3 miles, which is 15,840 feet, at 440 feet per minute. That's 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes.

Tim's only going 2 miles, or 10,560 feet, at 264 feet per minute. So, he takes 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Looks like Tim's gonna be 4 minutes late! 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Shawnda made.

She inflated 10 tires from bicycles (5 bikes * 2 tires each), 9 tires from tricycles (3 trikes * 3 tires each), and 1 tire from the unicycle. That's a total of 20 tires!

Since each tire costs 25 cents to inflate, she made 20 * $0.25 = $5.00. 


$5.00
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Carl's got 10 packs of cookies with 6 in each, so that's 10 * 6 = 60 cookies.  Each cookie costs a dime, so 60 cookies will cost 60 * $0.10 = $6.00. If he pays with a ten dollar bill, his change is $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.

$4.00 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

That sneaky seagull took half of Dave's fries, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left. Then those pesky pigeons ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries, leaving 21 - 9 = 12. The raccoon was a real jerk, taking two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries. That leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.  Since there was 1 left after the ants, there were 4 + 1 = 5 fries before the ants got to them.

Finally, adding up all the fries we know about: 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries in the pack originally. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kimo's got a busy schedule!

He has 9 hours of class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (3 classes x 1 hour each x 3 days).

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he's in class for 8 hours (2 classes x 2 hours each x 2 days).

That's a total of 17 hours per week. Over a 16-week semester, he spends 272 hours in class (17 hours/week x 16 weeks).

"
"Alright, let's see here.  Bill's got a lot of baking going on! 

First, we gotta figure out how many inches all those rolls add up to: 300 rolls times 4 inches each is 1200 inches.

Then the croissants: 120 croissants times 6 inches each is 720 inches.

Now those baguettes are tricky - they're two feet long, so that's 24 inches each.  60 baguettes times 24 inches each is 1440 inches.

Add it all up: 1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches.

Finally, we gotta convert that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 3360 inches divided by 12 is 280 feet.

So the answer is 280 feet.

"Alright, let's break this down. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field, so he covers 1500 yards. Kelly runs back and forth once for 100 yards, then does 34 trips to the 40-yard line and back, which is 34 times 80 yards, or 2720 yards.  That means she runs a total of 2820 yards. Kelly wins by 1320 yards!

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Raphael spent. 

He bought 4 pens at $1.50 each, so that's 4 * $1.50 = $6.00.

He also got 2 notebooks at $4.00 each, which is 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

And finally, the bond paper cost $20.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Anakin caught a bunch of sea creatures: 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer seahorses, and 2 more clownfish.  

To find the total, we need to add up all the starfish, seahorses, and clownfish they both caught.

* Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
* Locsin: (10-5) + (6-3) + (3+2) = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
* Together: 19 + 13 = 32

They caught a total of 32 fish! 



"
"Hey there! This is a bit of a tricky one, but let's break it down.  

The price goes up by 20% every two months, so over 36 months, that's 18 price increases. Each increase is $4 (20% of $20).

So, after 36 months, the bag of marbles would cost $92.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

If Seth is twice Brooke's age, we can say Seth's age is 2 times Brooke's age.  

In two years, they'll both be older. Seth will be 2 times Brooke's age plus 2 years, and Brooke will be her current age plus 2 years.

We know that in two years, their ages added together will equal 28.

Let's use some algebra to solve for Seth's age:

* Let Brooke's current age be ""b""
* Seth's current age is ""2b""

In two years:

* Brooke's age will be ""b + 2""
* Seth's age will be ""2b + 2""

Their ages in two years added together equal 28:

(b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms:

3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3:

b = 8

Now that we know Brooke is 8, we can find Seth's age:

Seth's age = 2 * 8 = 16



Seth is 16 years old. 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Ethel has $8, and Jimmy has $2 more than twice that amount, we gotta do a little math. Twice Ethel's money is $8 * 2 = $16.  Then add the extra $2 Jimmy has: $16 + $2 = $18.

So Jimmy has $18.

"
"Hey there! Let's break down the cost of these uniforms.

The jacket is three times the price of the hat, which means it costs $25 * 3 = $75.

To find the price of the pants, we need to average the cost of the hat and jacket: ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

Finally, add up the cost of all the pieces: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

So, each uniform costs $150.

"Alright, let's break this down. Sally Thirtytwo is 8, and Sally Four is the same age, so Sally Four is also 8. Granny Red is twice Sally Four's age, so she's 8 * 2 = 16. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, making her 16 + 3 = 19.  

To find the total age, we add up the ages of all four birds: 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51.

He spends a quarter of his $6000 salary on rent, which is $1500. Then, he uses a third of his salary on car fuel, coming to $2000. That's a total of $3500 already gone.

He donates half of what's left, so he gives $1250 to charity.  Adding his $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife brings his total expenses to $5650.

Subtracting that from his $6000 salary leaves him with $350.

"Alright, let's break this down.  The fast team is going to finish in 220 seconds flat – 55 seconds per runner times four runners.

The other team's first runner takes 60 seconds. Then they get 3 seconds faster each time, so the next runner is at 57, then 54, and finally 51. Add those up and they finish in 222 seconds.

That means the faster team wins by 2 seconds! 



"
"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

There are three numbers on a standard die that are greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6), so the chance of rolling one of those is 3 out of 6, or 50%.

To get two even numbers in a row, we need an even number on the first roll (3 out of 6 chance) AND another even number on the second roll (also a 3 out of 6 chance).  Multiply those probabilities together: (3/6) * (3/6) = 9 out of 36, which simplifies to 1 out of 4, or 25%.

The difference between those probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we gotta see how much straw the hamsters and rabbits used up. The hamsters used 10 hamsters * 5 pieces of straw/hamster = 50 pieces of straw. The rabbits used 20 pieces.

That means the rats used 160 total pieces - 50 pieces (hamsters) - 20 pieces (rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat gets 6 pieces, there are 90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces/rat = 15 rats.

Finally, with 15 rats split evenly into 3 cages, there are 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats per cage.

"Hey guys, let's figure this out!

So they spent $20.25 on tickets, and $4.50 less on food, which is $15.75.  The rides cost $33 each, so that's $66 total.  Adding it all up, they spent $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

Splitting that evenly means each person paid $102 / 3 = $34.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If ten ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each per week, that's a total of 35 pounds (3.5 x 10 = 35).

So the answer is 5. 



"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 more each year, but he also chops down 2. So, each year he gains 8 trees (10 - 2 = 8).

Over 10 years, that's 80 more trees (8 * 10 = 80).  That brings his total to 130 trees (50 + 80 = 130).

But wait, 30% of those trees die! That's 39 trees (130 * 0.30 = 39).

So, after the tree deaths, Tom has 91 trees left (130 - 39 = 91).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Elaine started with 20 cards.  Then she got a bunch more, three times her starting amount, so that's 20 * 3 = 60 cards.

In the second month, she got 20 fewer than the first month, meaning she got 60 - 20 = 40 cards.

Over the first two months, she collected a total of 60 + 40 = 100 cards.

The third month was a big one! She doubled her cards from the first two months, so she got 100 * 2 = 200 cards.

"Alright, let's crack this chicken egg problem!

Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens. We know a few things:

* White chickens lay more eggs:  Each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day, while each red chicken lays 3.
* More white chickens: Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* Total eggs: Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs in total.

We can use these clues to figure out how many red chickens Jerry has.  Think of it like a puzzle!

Let me know if you want to work through the math together, or if you'd like me to lay out the solution.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

The park's perimeter is what matters here since that's the distance Gary walks.  It's a rectangle, so we do: 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles) = 15 miles.

Since he walks at 3 miles per hour, it takes him 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = 5 hours.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Sloane saw 100 customers on the first day and 50 more on the second, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers for the first two days.

Since the total for three days was 500, she must have seen 500 - 150 = 250 customers on the third day. 


250 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Think about it this way: the pools are losing water at the same rate, so the difference in how much water they have now compared to 4 minutes ago is the same amount.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, and now it has four times as much, that means the big pool lost the same amount of water as the small pool *plus* three times the amount of water in the small pool.

That means the small pool must have 8 gallons in it now. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Lori needs to save up $320 for the shoes plus $32 for the belt, so that's a total of $352. If she makes $8 an hour, she'll need to work $352 / $8 = 44 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Janeth owes $2000 plus 10% interest, which is $200. That means she needs to pay back a total of $2200.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid $165 * 12 = $1980.

Subtracting that from the total amount owed, she'll still have $2200 - $1980 = $220 left to pay.


$220 

"
"Hey there! Let's see... 4 roses plus 7 more dahlias means there are 11 dahlias.  That's a total of 15 flowers.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, making him 63. Zack is twice Harriet's age, so he's 42.

In three years, they'll be 66, 24, and 45 respectively.  Adding those up gives us 135, and dividing by 3 gives us an average age of 45. 


45
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Naomi scored 68 points, and Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's score, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

That means Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Celine started with 120 liters and used 90, leaving her with 30 liters. Then she collected double that amount in rainwater, which is 60 liters.  Adding that to what was left, she has 90 liters in the tank now. 


90 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias.  

In total, he plants 90 + 50 = 140 flowers. 


140 

"
"Hey there!  Let me break that down for you.

They spent $15000 the first year, and then a third of that, which is $5000, the second year.  So in total, they spent $15000 + $5000 = $20000 on advertising.


$20000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Carlos spends $30 per hour for 3 hours, so that's $30 * 3 = $90. Benji spends $18 per hour for 5 hours, so that's $18 * 5 = $90.  

Altogether, they spend $90 + $90 = $180. 


180 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If it takes 6 days by bus, and half that time by car, then the car trip is 3 days.  That means the whole round trip is 6 days there + 3 days back = 9 days.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, James has 32 water type cards left (40 - 8). Then he'll have 34 grass type cards (20 + 14). That means he has a total of 96 cards (30 + 34 + 32).

To find the percentage chance of picking a water type, we do (32 / 96) * 100% which equals 33.33%. Rounding that to the nearest integer gives us 33%.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Chad owes.  

His burrito starts at $6.50. Then he adds $2.00 for extra meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and $0.50 for two sauces. That brings his total to $11.00.

He wants the meal upgrade for $3.00 more, so now it's $14.00.

But wait! He has a $5.00 gift card, so he subtracts that.

That means Chad owes $9.00. 


$9.00

"
"Hey there! Let me see... 30% of the watermelons were ready at first, so that's 120 * 0.30 = 36 melons. That leaves 120 - 36 = 84 melons. Then, 3/4 of those were ready two weeks later, which is 84 * (3/4) = 63 melons.  That means 84 - 63 = 21 melons weren't ready yet.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So Mark's buying 12 cars at 20 grand a pop, that's 12 times 20,000, which is 240,000 bucks. Then there's that pesky 10% tax, so tack on another 24,000.  That brings the total for the cars to 264,000.  Don't forget the 1000 bucks he's gotta shell out to register each one, so that's another 12,000.  

Add it all up, and Mark's looking at a grand total of 276,000 dollars.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... if there were 50 ants and half as many bugs, that means there were 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.  So, in total, there were 50 + 25 = 75 insects in the garden. 

75 

"
"Hey there!  Let me see... 36 penguins start sunbathing, and then a third go swimming and another third go eat.  That means 12 penguins went swimming and 12 went to eat.  So, 12 + 12 = 24 penguins left the sunbathing spot. That means 36 - 24 = 12 penguins are still sunbathing!

12 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half that, so she eats 3. That's a total of 9 tomatoes a day for the lovebirds.  

Over a week, they'd go through 9 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 63 tomatoes.

Each vine pumps out 3 tomatoes a week, so they'll need 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  If each of John's 20 friends wants 4 slices, that's a total of 80 slices needed (20 x 4 = 80). Since each pizza has 8 slices, John needs to order 10 pizzas (80 / 8 = 10).

"
"Hey there! This is a fun one.  

So Ram can make a new pen out of five empty ones. That means with 25 pens, he can make 25 / 5 = 5 new pens.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, 30% of the students, or 300 students, left through exit A. That leaves 700 students.

Then, 3/5 of those remaining students, which is 420 students, went out through exit B.

That means the rest, 280 students, must have used exit C. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. John has 54 candies, and that's twice the amount Robert has. So Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies. James has 6 more candies than Robert, meaning he has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.  

That means John has 54 - 33 = 21 more candies than James.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but stopped talking to 2, leaving him with 3.  Each of those 3 pals sends 2 letters a week, and he writes 2 back, for a total of 6 letters he sends and 6 he gets, or 12 letters total. Each letter is 5 pages long, so that's 12 letters * 5 pages/letter = 60 pages. If he writes a page every 6 minutes, that's 60 pages * 6 minutes/page = 360 minutes of writing.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he spends 360 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6 hours writing each week.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jason uses 15 minutes a day for his boss, so that's 15 * 30 = 450 minutes.  Add that to the extra 300 minutes he used, and he's used a total of 750 minutes. Since his plan has 1000 minutes, he has 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes left.

"Alright, let's break this down. Griffin started with 24 fries, Kyle snagged 5, and Billy took double that, which is 10 fries. So together they took 15 fries, leaving Griffin with 9. Then Colby took 3 less than Kyle, meaning he took 2 fries. That brings Griffin down to 7 fries.  Since he ended up with 27, Ginger must have given him 20 fries! 



"
"Hey there! Let's crack this snail and fish puzzle.  

The difference in snails between the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. Since this difference is twice the number of fish in each aquarium, there must be 28 / 2 = 14 fish in each aquarium.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  So, her makeup artist charges $250 an hour, and it takes 6 hours a day, four days a week. That's $250 * 6 = $1500 per day, and $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week. Over five weeks, that's $6000 * 5 = $30,000. But wait, there's a 10% discount! That's $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000 off. So, Jean pays $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.


$27000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Isabelle spent a total of $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 on the party. Since she split the cost with her two parents, that means there are 3 people paying.  So, each person pays $96 / 3 = $32. 


$32
"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for ya.  

The chef bought 200 pounds of onions (4 bags x 50 pounds per bag). Since onions cost $1.50 a pound, the chef spent $300.00 in total (200 pounds x $1.50 per pound). 


$300.00 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Sue ate a lot of cookies!

* On Monday, she ate 4 times her sister's 5 cookies, so that's 20 cookies.
* On Tuesday, she ate double her sister's 13 cookies, meaning 26 cookies.
* That's a total of 46 cookies for Sue! Her sister ate 18 in total.

Now, each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue ate 46 * 200 = 9200 calories. Her sister ate 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference is 9200 - 3600 = 5600 calories.

Sue ate a whopping 5600 more calories than her sister!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Alright, so the school has 60 students total (20 per class times 3 classes). Since it's half boys and half girls, that means there are 30 boys and 30 girls.

The first two classes have 27 girls (15 + 12), leaving 3 girls for the third class.

That means the third class has 17 boys (20 total students - 3 girls).

"
"Let's see... Rick's a busy guy!  He took down 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Today, he got three times as many wolves as cougars, and three fewer cougars than yesterday.  That means he bagged 12 cougars today (15 - 3 = 12) and a whopping 36 wolves (12 x 3 = 36).

In total, that's 46 wolves (10 + 36 = 46) and 27 cougars (15 + 12 = 27).

Adding those up, Rick killed a total of 73 animals.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Bill starts on the 3rd floor and goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6, we gotta do a little math.

4 times his starting floor is 4 * 3 = 12.

Then we add 6: 12 + 6 = 18.

So Bill is now on the 18th floor! 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than that, which is 30 * 0.30 = 9 fewer times. So Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times. Robert went down 4 times as many as Anne, meaning he went down 21 * 4 = 84 times. 


84 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  We start with 10 stalls and 20 cows in each, so that's 10 * 20 = 200 cows. Then Mr. Sylas adds 40 more cows, bringing the total to 200 + 40 = 240 cows.

Now he splits those 240 cows evenly among the 20 stalls, so each stall gets 240 / 20 = 12 cows.

Finally, we want to know how many cows are in 8 of those stalls, which is 8 * 12 = 96 cows.


96

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

That redwood is HUGE!  Okay, so it's 200 feet tall and each 10-foot chunk weighs 400 pounds. That means there are 20 sections in total, right? So, 20 sections times 400 pounds each is 8000 pounds. But those pesky termites got to 30% of it. That's 2400 pounds of wood gone!  

So, 8000 pounds minus 2400 pounds means the redwood now weighs 5600 pounds.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

If Andrea has 52 apples and that's 8 more than Jamal, then Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so he's got 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, meaning she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Altogether, Andrea has 52 + 24 = 76 fruits, and Jamal has 44 + 48 = 92 fruits.

That means they have a combined total of 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Carla's baking a whole lotta cookies!  

She needs 2 cups of flour for every 12 cookies, right?  So first, we gotta see how many dozens she's making in total: 36 cookies today plus 30 tomorrow is 66 cookies. That's 66 divided by 12, which is 5 and a half dozen cookies.

Since each dozen needs 2 cups of flour, she'll need 5.5 times 2 cups, which is 11 cups of flour.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we gotta figure out how much the fees are. The brokerage fee is 5% of $350,000, which is $17,500. Then there's the transfer fee, which is 12% of $350,000, coming out to $42,000.

Adding those to the selling price, the total cost of the house is $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500.

That's $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000. 


$9,500
"
"Hey there! Let's break down Mr. Tan's house sale.

First, we need to figure out his total expenses. The transfer fees are 3% of $400,000, which is $12,000. The brokerage fee is 5% of $400,000, coming out to $20,000.  Adding those together with the $250,000 he paid for the remaining loan, his total expenses are $282,000.

Finally, to find his net proceeds, we subtract his expenses from the selling price: $400,000 - $282,000 = $118,000.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling his house are $118,000. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down.  It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then another 40% of that time to get to 400 degrees.  So that's 20 minutes times 0.40, which is 8 more minutes.  

That means it takes 28 minutes total to heat the oil.  Then, cooking takes 5 minutes less than that, so 23 minutes.

Adding it all up, from starting the oil to having cooked chicken takes 51 minutes. 



"
"Hey there! Let me break that down for you.  

So, he spent $5 on each newspaper ad and got 50 of those, which is 50 * $5 = $250.

Then he spent $75 on each TV ad and got 15 of those, coming to 15 * $75 = $1125.

Adding those together, his total cost was $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Each house has 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows in the bedrooms.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  The mom spends $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00. Since she paid with $20.00, her change is $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00.

$5.00 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette is double the collar, meaning it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.  

That means the body, collar, and rosette together use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches. Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 - 1170) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds. 

She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so that's 20 * $40 = $800.

"Alright, let's break this down. Carly starts with 80 cards.  Two-fifths of them have an A, so that's 32 cards (80 x 2/5 = 32). That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48).

Half of those have a B, which is 24 cards (48 x 1/2 = 24).  That leaves another 24 cards (48 - 24 = 24).

Five-eighths of those have a C, so that's 15 cards (24 x 5/8 = 15).

Finally, the rest must have a D, which is 9 cards (24 - 15 = 9).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Alright, so Matthew needs 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of those. That's 30 * 3 = 90 minutes.

For the big holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, so that's 15 * 10 = 150 minutes.

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

"
"Hey there!  

If their ages add up to 20 now, in 10 years they'll both be 10 years older. That means their combined age will be 20 + 20 = 40.

40 

"
"Hey there! This is a classic age word problem. Let's break it down.

Let's say Sam is ""s"" years old now. That means Ruby is 6 times Sam's age, or 6s years old.

In 9 years, Sam will be s + 9 years old, and Ruby will be 6s + 9 years old.  We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be three times Sam's age, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So Sam is currently 6 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  A cobra has 70 spots, and that's double the spots of a mamba, so a mamba has 35 spots.  There are 40 cobras with a total of 2800 spots (40 x 70 = 2800). The 60 mambas have 2100 spots (60 x 35 = 2100). That means all the snakes have 4900 spots together (2800 + 2100 = 4900). Half of that is 2450.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, we've got 12 players, and each brings 2 guests, so that's 12 * 2 = 24 guests.  Don't forget the 3 coaches too! That's a total of 12 + 24 + 3 = 39 people needing pizza.

Each pizza feeds 3 people, so Maddy needs 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas.

If each pizza is $15, the total cost will be 13 * $15 = $195.

"Alright, let's break this down.  Each necklace has 8 topaz stones that are each 1 inch long, so that's 8 inches total for the topaz.  The whole necklace is 25 inches, so that leaves 17 inches for the silver beads (25 - 8 = 17). Since each bead is 1/4 inch long, Katerina uses 68 beads (17 / 0.25 = 68).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40, and Margot wrote 60 in the first week. That's a total of 120 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled their stories. So Alani wrote 40, Braylen wrote 80, and Margot wrote 120. That's another 240 stories!

Adding those together, they wrote a whopping 360 stories in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kelly's got 5 quarters, which is 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents. She also has 2 dimes, so that's 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents.  

In total, she has 125 + 20 = 145 cents.  After buying the pop for 55 cents, she'll have 145 - 55 = 90 cents left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, we've got 24 stars from the three rows of 8 and 12 stars from the two rows of 6. That's 36 stars total.

That leaves 40 stars for the 5-star rows (76 total stars - 36 stars = 40 stars).

Since each row has 5 stars, there must be 8 rows of 5 stars (40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows).

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Those flagstones are heavy!  If each one weighs 75 pounds, then 80 of them would weigh 6000 pounds (80 x 75 = 6000).  Since each truck can only carry 2000 pounds, they'll need 3 trucks to move all those flagstones in one trip (6000 / 2000 = 3).

"
"Hey there!  Let me see... the fast car is zooming along at 60 miles per hour, and the slowpoke is only doing half that, which is 30 miles per hour.  If the fast car covers 480 miles, the slow car takes longer. To figure out how long, we divide the distance by the slow car's speed: 480 miles / 30 miles per hour = 16 hours.

So the answer is 16. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ali has 22 medals, and Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 17. Together they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.  Since they have 10 times fewer medals than the total given out, there must be 39 x 10 = 390 medals in total.

"Alright, let's break this down. Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 less than Mike, so that's 18 points. Tony has double Mike's points, meaning he has 42 points.  

Now, for the extra points: Mike and Tony both get one because they have over 20 points. So, Mike has 22, Jim has 18, and Tony has 43.

Adding those up, they have a total of 83 points.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

On day two, Darren does 120 pushups, 40 squats, and 40 dumbbell presses.

Adding up all the exercises for both days:

Day 1: 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises
Day 2: 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises

Total: 170 + 200 = 370 exercises

"
"Hey there! Let me see... they eat 0.2 kg of rice per meal, twice a day, and there are 5 people. So that's 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day * 5 people = 2 kg of rice gone every day.  A 42 kg bag will last them 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days. That's 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Sam had a goal of selling 120 crates, but he was closed for two days.  He sold 20 crates over the weekend, then 15 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, and 18 on Thursday. That's a total of 65 crates sold.  

To see how far off he was, we subtract: 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

Sam was 55 crates short of his goal.

"Alright, let's figure this out. John's got a 30-mile commute each way, so that's 60 miles a day.  He works 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week. Over a year, that's 15,000 miles (300 miles/week * 50 weeks). At $2 a mile, that's $30,000 for mileage alone. Plus, he gives his driver a $150 bonus every month, which adds up to $1,800 a year.  

Adding those together, John pays $31,800 a year for his driving service.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Peter wants to exercise twice as long on Tuesday as he did on Sunday and Monday combined.  Sunday was 23 minutes and Monday was 16 minutes, so that's 23 + 16 = 39 minutes total.

To double that for Tuesday, he needs to exercise for 39 * 2 = 78 minutes.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Elise sold 45 books this year, and she has 50 left, meaning she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in the first two years. Since she sold twice as many in the first year compared to this year, she sold 200 - 45 = 155 books in the first year.  That means she sold 155 - 45 = 110 books in the second year.  At $20 a book, she made 110 * $20 = $2200 in the second year.

"Hey there! Let's crack this problem.

So, Cera is 46 now, which means six years ago she was 40. Noah was half her age then, making him 20.  Chile's population back then was 3000 times Noah's age, so that's 3000 * 20 = 60000.

But that was six years ago, and the problem says that was only half the current population.  So, Chile's population now is 60000 * 2 = 120000.


120000 

"
"Hey there! This is a classic sports math problem. Let me break it down.

Think of it like this: the offense is the biggest group, then defense, and special teams is the smallest.  Since offense is double the defense, and special teams is half the defense, we can figure out the defense first.

If we call the defense ""d"", the offense is ""2d"" and special teams is ""d/2"".  All those players together have to equal 105.

So, d + 2d + d/2 = 105

That means 3.5d = 105

Divide both sides by 3.5 and you get d = 30.

So there are **30** players on defense. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3 * 4 = 12 people.  That's a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people.

But, 8 people got sick and couldn't make it, and another 8 / 4 = 2 people had other plans. So, in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come.

That means 24 - 10 = 14 people showed up to Martha's party.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Solomon starts with 50 marbles and gets 20 more from Johanna, so that's 50 + 20 = 70 marbles. His dad gives him 2/5 * 20 = 8 more marbles.

That means Solomon has a total of 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.

Since each marble weighs 2 kgs, the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kgs.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  A pool that's 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep... that's a good-sized pool!  

First, we gotta find out how much water that is.  

6 times 4 times 5... that's 120 cubic feet of water.

Now, it costs 10 cents per cubic foot to fill it up. So 120 times 0.10...

That'll be $12.00 to fill the pool.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Jam has 26 pencils total, and 2 are loose, so that means she has 26 - 2 = 24 pencils in boxes.

Together, Jam and Meg have 24 + 46 = 70 pencils.

If each box holds, say, 8 pencils, they'd need 70 / 8 = 8.75 boxes.  Since you can't have part of a box, they'd need 9 boxes to fit all their pencils.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, and she needs to cool it by 65 degrees. That means she'll use 65 degrees / 13 degrees per cube = 5 ice cubes.  

That's 5 cubes * 12 ml/cube = 60 ml weaker from the ice.  

Don't forget the cream! That adds another 15 ml of weakness.

So in total, her iced coffee is 60 ml + 15 ml = 75 ml weaker.

"Hey there!  Let me see... they got 7 new records, and each trade gets you one new record. So that means there were 7 trades.  Since each trade needs 2 old records, they brought in 7 trades * 2 old records per trade = 14 old records.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

First, we figure out how many junior programmers there are: 2/5 of 100 employees is 40 junior programmers.

That means there are 60 senior programmers (100 total employees - 40 junior programmers).

Senior programmers make $400 more than junior programmers, so they earn $2400 each.

Now, let's calculate the total salary for each group:

* Junior programmers: 40 programmers * $2000/programmer = $80,000
* Senior programmers: 60 programmers * $2400/programmer = $144,000

Finally, add those together to find the total salary for all programmers: $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours, so that's $30,000 before taxes. With a 20% tax rate, Nick would take home $24,000.

Job B pays a flat $42,000, but there's a $6,000 property tax hit right off the bat. That leaves $36,000. Then, there's a 10% tax on that, which is $3,600. So, his net income for Job B is $32,400.

Job B pays Nick $8,400 more than Job A.

"Alright, let's break this down. Maria starts with 8 shares at $8 each, so that's 8 * $8 = $64.

The first year, the stock jumps up 50%, which is like adding half its value: $8 * 0.50 = $4.  So now each share is worth $8 + $4 = $12.

The second year, the stock drops 25%, which is like taking away a quarter of its value: $12 * 0.25 = $3.  That brings the price down to $12 - $3 = $9 per share.

Finally, Maria has 8 shares worth $9 each, for a total of 8 * $9 = $72.

Let's see... if we think of it like this:

* If he had only cows, he'd have 60 / 3 = 20 cows.
* Since he has twice as many chickens, that's 20 * 2 = 40 chickens.

Now, cows have 4 legs each, so that's 20 * 4 = 80 legs.

Chickens have 2 legs each, so that's 40 * 2 = 80 legs.

Add those together, and you get a grand total of 160 legs!

Now, add up all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

So Andrea saved $21. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down. John spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so that's 3 hours. He also watched 3 shows at 2 hours each, totaling 6 hours.  That means he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours on those activities.

We know that's 30% of his total vacation time.  If 15 hours is 30%, then his whole vacation was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

Finally, he spent 40% of his time sightseeing, so that's 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Annabelle needs $400 and already has $80. That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

Now, her first job pays her $10 an hour for 20 hours, so that's $10 * 20 = $200.

Her second job pays $5 an hour for 15 hours, so that's $5 * 15 = $75.

In total, she earns $200 + $75 = $275 from both jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she has $275 + $80 = $355.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Marisa gets $5 a day and spends $1 on lollipops, so she saves $4 each day. Over 5 days, that's $4 x 5 = $20. 

$20.00 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Billy had $10 and spent some on candy.  We know he spent half his change on gumballs, and those cost $2.00 total. That means he had $4.00 left after buying the candy. Since candy costs $1.50 a pound, he must have bought 2.67 pounds.

"
"Hey there!  Let me see... Carver is 45, and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age.  To figure out the son's age, we can set up an equation: 2 * (son's age) - 5 = 45.  

Solving for the son's age, we get 25.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

The train travels 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 125 miles (since it's 50 less than the first two combined). That's a total of 300 miles for one round trip.

It does this three times a day, so that's 900 miles a day.

To go 18,000 miles, it'll take 20 days.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. A collie bed needs 5 pounds of stuffing (that's right in the middle of a Rottweiler and chihuahua bed).  So, for the chihuahuas, that's 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing. For the collies, it's 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds.  Add those together, and Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  John drives 200 miles to his buddy's place at 70 mph, but a detour adds an extra 10 miles.  So that's 210 miles one way.  Then he takes a 240-mile route back home going 80 mph.

To find the total time, we gotta calculate each leg separately.

Going there: 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Coming back: 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Total trip time: 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours

"
"Let's see... 96 kids in total, and 43 are girls. That means there are 53 boys.  If 4 boys were absent, then 49 boys were at school. 


49 

"
"Hey there!  There are 6 girls, and twice that number of boys, so there are 6 * 2 = 12 boys.  That means there are 6 + 12 = 18 kids in the park.

"
"Hey there!  To figure this out, we gotta see how many more points Jane needs. She wants at least 42 points total, and she already has 15 + 18 = 33 points.  So, she needs 42 - 33 = 9 more points on her third test.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

They kicked out 3 folks for not wearing masks. Then they kicked out four times that many, minus 5, for shoplifting. So that's 3 * 4 - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Those shoplifters must have caused a scene because three times that number got tossed for fighting over sale items. That's 7 * 3 = 21 brawlers.

In total, that's 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people kicked out for those reasons.

Since 50 people got kicked out in total, that means 50 - 31 = 19 people got the boot for other reasons. 


19 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Erin has 14 points now, and that's three times more than Sara's 8 points.  That means Erin had 24 points before scoring more.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, 44 seniors need picture frames at $20 each, that's $880 right there.  Each frame also needs etching, which adds another 20%, so that's $4 extra per frame, making the etching a total of $176.  Two seniors get pins for $5 each, so that's $10.  And since a quarter of the seniors are officers, that's 11 officers who need cords at $12 each, totaling $132.

Adding it all up: $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.


$1198

"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for ya.

So, they sold 14 pairs on Friday, then double that on Saturday, which is 28 pairs.  On Sunday, they sold half of Saturday's amount, so that's 14 pairs. But then 6 people brought shoes back, leaving them with 8 pairs sold for Sunday.

Adding it all up: 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 pairs of shoes sold.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Hallie dances for 1 hour on Tuesdays, 2 hours on Thursdays, and twice her Tuesday time on Saturdays, which is another 2 hours.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If 40% of the equipment was faulty, that means 60% was working.  So, they spent 60% of $400,000 on good equipment.  

60% of $400,000 is $240,000.


$240,000 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Mary has 15 sheep giving 1 kg of milk each, so that's 15 kg. The other 15 sheep give 2 kg each, for a total of 30 kg.  Adding those together, Mary gets 45 kg of milk every day.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Mrs. Sherman had 12 rolls and gave 6 to her kids. That leaves 6 rolls for the chickens. She cuts each of those into 8 pieces, so that's 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces for the chickens. 


48 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Half the class likes blue, so that's 40 / 2 = 20 pupils. That leaves 40 - 20 = 20 pupils who like other colors.

One-fourth of those like green, so that's 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

That means 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Lucy made $56 on Monday selling apples for $4 each, so she sold 56 / 4 = 14 apples.  Then she picked 12 more on Tuesday and double that, or 24, on Wednesday.  That means she picked a total of 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Karan's total interest for the loan is $1825 (calculated as $3650 * 10% * 5 months / 12 months).

Adding that to the original loan amount, she needs to repay a total of $5475.

To find her monthly payment, we divide the total repayment by the number of months: $5475 / 5 = $1095.


So, Karan has to pay $1095 each month. 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Cho hiked for a longer time and at a faster pace, so he definitely went farther.  

Cho covered 14 kilometers every hour for 8 hours, so he hiked 14 * 8 = 112 kilometers.

Chloe hiked 9 kilometers each hour for 5 hours, meaning she hiked 9 * 5 = 45 kilometers.

To find the difference, we subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's: 112 - 45 = 67 kilometers.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Anna has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos and 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

That means together they have 50 + 100 = 150 silver pesos and 80 + 120 = 200 gold pesos.

Adding those up, they have a total of 150 + 200 = 350 pesos.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Millie's got 3 pitchers times 12 cups a pitcher, that's 36 cups of lemonade.  She sells each cup for a buck, so that's $36 total. But she spent $18 on supplies, so her profit is $18. Now, she sells 4 cups an hour, so her profit per hour is $18 divided by 9 hours, which is $2 an hour.

"
"Hey there!  

Let's see... if 12.8 hectares is 2/5 of his land, then to find the whole amount, we need to figure out what 5/5 would be.  We can do that by dividing 12.8 by 2 and then multiplying by 5.

12.8 / 2 = 6.4
6.4 * 5 = 32

So Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Half the choir are girls, so there are 52 / 2 = 26 girls.

If half of them can't make it, that's 26 / 2 = 13 girls who miss the show.

That leaves 26 - 13 = 13 girls to perform.

With the 3 teachers joining in, there are a total of 13 + 3 = 16 people singing.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If the popsicle ratio is 5:6, that means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  

Think of it like groups. Each group has 5 + 6 = 11 popsicles.

They have a total of 165 popsicles, so there are 165 / 11 = 15 groups of popsicles.

Betty has 5 popsicles per group, so she has 5 * 15 = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 popsicles per group, so he has 6 * 15 = 90 popsicles.

That means Sam has 90 - 75 = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"
"Hey there! Let's see... Tim's saving some serious cash by ditching cable.  

Hulu and Disney Plus together would normally be $20, but he gets a sweet 20% discount for bundling, bringing it down to $16. Add in his Netflix for $10, and his total streaming cost is $26. That's a whopping $34 saved compared to his old $60 cable bill!

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Carol spends 4 hours writing, 2 hours recording (half the writing time), and 1.5 hours editing. That's a total of 7.5 hours.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total time and multiply by 100%: (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100% = 20%

So the answer is 20%. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns, that's 6 * 6 = 36 spaces for books.

Wendy wants to double that, so that's 36 * 2 = 72 books.

But wait, she wants 20 *more* than double, so we add 20: 72 + 20 = 92 books.

She'll need 92 books.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Mark needs four times the normal amount of ingredients. That's 3 cups of flour times 4, which is 12 cups of flour. Since each bag has 2 cups, he'll need 6 bags. For milk, he needs 1 cup times 4, which is 4 cups.  That means he needs 2 bottles.  

So, he needs 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk, which means he needs 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

If Mel cuts back his AC use by 5 hours a day, he's saving 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours every day.  That's equal to 4.5 kilowatt-hours (since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt).

Over 30 days, that adds up to 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  Two zebras have 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. Then we've got one zebra with 36 stripes and another with half that, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  Adding them all up, we get 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes. Since there are four zebras, the average is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes per zebra. 


22 

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Tyson needs enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich feeds 4, so he'll need 5 sandwiches. That means 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.  Meat is $7 a pound, so that's $35. Cheese is $3 a pound, so that's $15.  In total, Tyson will spend $50 on meat and cheese.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Allan starts with 40 cannolis and twice that amount in corn, so he has 40 * 2 = 80 corns.

He then buys 60 more cannolis, bringing his total to 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.

But he buys 40 fewer corns than his new cannoli total, meaning he gets 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding up his corn, he now has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, his grand total of corn and cannolis is 140 + 100 = 240.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Elliott needs to take 10,000 steps. He did half on his way to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then he did another 1,000 steps with his friend. That's a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.  Since he only has 2,000 left to go, he must have done 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

2,000 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Toby's got a 45-page book with 200 words on each page, so that's 45 * 200 = 9000 words total. He reads 300 words a minute, so the book will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.  

Factoring in the 10-minute drive to the airport, he'll need 30 + 10 = 40 minutes total. Since he has a full hour before he needs to be there, he'll be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

In May, they paid 40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = $96,000.

In June, they had 40 employees * (1/4) = 10 employees leave. That leaves 30 employees.

So, in June they paid 30 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = $72,000.

Adding those together, the total for both months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Hey there! Let's break down Tim's firework spending.

The second pack cost him $400 * 2 = $800.

That means his total before the discount was $400 + $800 = $1200.

With a 20% discount, he saved $1200 * 0.20 = $240.

After the discount, his fireworks cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, adding the finale firework, his total spending was $960 + $150 = $1110.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Each blouse is $20, and they're 30% off, so that's a discount of $6 per blouse ($20 x 0.30 = $6). That means each blouse costs $14 ($20 - $6 = $14).  Since Misha buys 4 blouses, the total cost is $56 ($14 x 4 = $56).

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Joanne gets 30 apples from the tall trees and half that from the short ones, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister doubles Joanne's tall tree haul, getting 30 * 2 = 60 apples, and triples her short tree haul, getting 15 * 3 = 45 apples.  

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tall and short trees. That means Joanne got 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"
"Hey there! This is a classic animal riddle. Let me see... 

Alright, so we know each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one.  If we think about it, the difference in humps is what's going to help us figure out how many of each animal we have.

Let's say we have 'c' camels and 'd' dromedaries.  We know:

*  c + d = 180 (total heads)
* 2c + d = 304 (total humps)

Hmm, if we subtract the first equation from the second, we get:

c = 124

Now we can plug that back into the first equation to find 'd':

124 + d = 180

So, d = 56

There are **56** dromedaries in the herd. 



"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

Tom traveled 200 kilometers a day for the first four days, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

The next two days he traveled 30% of that distance, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a break for a day, so no kilometers there.

Then, in the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding it all up: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

So Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers on his trip.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Bill paid for his streaming service.

*  He got a sweet deal for the first 6 months at $8 a month, so that's 6 * $8 = $48.
* Then it went up to $12 a month for 8 months, costing him 8 * $12 = $96.
* Finally, it jumped to $14 a month for another 8 months, which is 8 * $14 = $112.

Adding it all up: $48 + $96 + $112 = $256.

So, 2 years of the service cost Bill $256.

"Alright, let's break this down. Kenny wants to go to the amusement park, which costs $100. He's got some spending cash, too, so he must have made $50 from selling his cards.

If he sells each card for $1.50, that means he sold 33 cards (50 / 1.50 = 33.33, but you can't sell parts of cards!).

He kept 1/3 of his cards, meaning the 33 he sold represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total, we divide the number of cards sold by 2/3: 33 / (2/3) = 49.5.  Since he can't have half a card, he must have started with 50 cards. 


50
"
"Hey there! Let me see... so the caterer planned for half the guests to have two hot dogs, which is 36 / 2 = 18 guests. That means he made enough for 18 * 2 + 18 = 54 hot dogs.  But then 40 people showed up, and they all wanted seconds!  Since he only had enough for 54 / 2 = 27 people to have two hot dogs, that means 40 - 27 = 13 guests missed out on a second hot dog.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Indras has 6 letters in her name. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name. So, half of Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3 letters.  That means her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters.  

Together, their names have 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

"Hey there! Let's break down Charlotte's shopping trip.

First, those utensils cost 5 * $5.00 = $25.00.

Adding everything up, her total before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.

A 20% discount means she saves $165.00 * 0.20 = $33.00.

So, her final cost is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Antoine's doubling the onions, so that's 2 pounds times 2, which is 4 pounds of onions.  Those onions will cost him 4 pounds times $2.00 a pound, so that's $8.00. The beef stock is $4.00, so his total cost is $12.00.  Since he's making enough for 6 people, each serving costs $2.00.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Bernadette's drive is four times longer than Wayne's, who takes 4 minutes. That means Bernadette's drive is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.  Since she wants to be there 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes before him. 


21 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

First, we know the room is 3 yards long, which is the same as 9 feet (since there are 3 feet in a yard).

The area is 360 square feet, and we know area is length times width. So, to find the width, we divide the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

Now, to find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 9 feet + 40 feet + 9 feet + 40 feet = 98 feet.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (20 beads) and 2 packs of clear beads (40 beads), for a total of 60 beads. Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (60 beads) and 4 packs of red beads (80 beads), giving her 140 beads.

That means Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down.  The oven heats the place up 5 degrees every hour for three hours, so that's 15 degrees warmer. That brings the temperature to 55 degrees. Then the window cools things down 2 degrees every 10 minutes, and it's open for 30 minutes, so that's 6 degrees cooler.  

So the final temperature is 49 degrees. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, 80 minutes to bike, and 50 minutes to run, for a total of 170 minutes. James is 10% faster swimming, so he does that in 36 minutes (40 * 0.90). But James takes 5 extra minutes on the bike, putting him at 85 minutes.

Since Jon wins by 10 minutes, James' total time is 160 minutes (170 - 10).  That means his run time is 39 minutes (160 - 36 - 85).


39 

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Movie C is 1.25 hours long, which is 75 minutes. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than that, so it's 80 minutes. Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, it's 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes long.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

That horse is fast!  32 miles per hour is no joke.  So, in 30 minutes, he'll cover 16 miles.  

Since he eats half a bale of hay per mile, that's 8 bales of hay he'll need. At $3 a bale, that's $24.

Michael has $30, so he'll have $6 left over after buying the hay. 



"
"Alright, let's figure this out. Rozanne's got 4 dozen eggs, which is 48 eggs. Plus those 2 stragglers, that's 50 eggs total.  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can make 10 glasses of eggnog.  Since each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 2 trays.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we gotta figure out how much each balloon cost originally. If 20 balloons cost $900, then each one cost $900 / 20 = $45.

Then the price went up by $20, so each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Finally, to find out how much Bentley paid for 170 balloons, we multiply the new price by 170: $65 * 170 = $11050.


$11050 

"
"Hey there!  To find the average speed, we gotta think about the total distance and the total time.  

The car went 120 miles in the first part and 30 miles in the second, for a total of 150 miles. It drove for 2 hours plus 1 hour, so 3 hours total.

150 miles divided by 3 hours is 50 miles per hour.

So the average speed is 50 mph. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down. Jenna starts with 8 sapphires worth $800 each, so those are worth 8 * $800 = $6400. She trades 3 for rubies, leaving her with 5 sapphires worth 5 * $800 = $4000.  Those 3 sapphires got her 2 rubies worth $1200 each, for a total of 2 * $1200 = $2400.  

Adding up all her jewels, she has $4000 + $2400 = $6400 worth.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Each bed needs 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet of soil.

Since he has 10 beds, that's 32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet total.

Each bag holds 2 cubic feet, so he'll need 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags.

At $12 a bag, that'll cost him 160 bags * $12/bag = $1920. 


$1920
"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, there are 15 red cards, and there are 60% more green cards than that. That means there are 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.  

Adding those to the red cards, we get 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Now, the yellow cards are the same amount as the red and green cards combined, so that's 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total, we add up all the colors: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.

"
"Let's see... two boxes of sugar cubes at a pound each, that's 2 pounds. Then there are four bags of carrots at 12 pounds a bag, so that's 48 pounds.  The hay is 42 bales times 75 pounds a bale, which comes out to 3150 pounds. And finally, 20 sacks of oats at 65 pounds a sack is 1300 pounds.

Adding it all up, that's 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds of feed.

His truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so he'll need to make 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

"
"Let's figure this out! Miss Maria has a lot of cards! 

She has 6 decks of basketball cards with 25 in each, so that's 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.

Then she has 5 boxes of baseball cards with 40 in each, so that's 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.

In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards.

She keeps 50 for herself, leaving 350 - 50 = 300 cards for her students.

If each student gets 10 cards, she has 300 / 10 = 30 students.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Frank starts with 200 shoes. He gets 5 pairs (that's 10 shoes!) on Monday, 15 pairs (30 shoes!) on Wednesday, and 30 pairs (60 shoes!) on Friday. That's a total of 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 new shoes.

So now he has 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.

Uh oh, but then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday. That leaves him with 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So the answer is 120.

"Hey there! This one's a bit tricky, but let's break it down.  

Those remoras are tiny compared to that huge shark!  

First, we gotta figure out how long the remoras are together. Two remoras at 6 inches each means they're 12 inches long total.

Now, the shark is a whopping 10 feet, which is 120 inches.

To get the percentage, we divide the remoras' length (12 inches) by the shark's length (120 inches) and multiply by 100. That gives us 10%!

"Alright, let's break this down.  Two packs of razors at four razors a pack means she's getting eight razors total.  With the buy one get one free deal, she's essentially paying for two packs, but getting four packs worth. That's $8.00, but then she takes off $2.00 with the coupon, bringing it down to $6.00.  So, eight razors for $6.00 means each razor costs 75 cents.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Nine cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and one is 60 inches.  So the tallest nine make up the base of the pyramid. That's 9 cheerleaders * 64 inches/cheerleader = 576 inches. Add in the shortest cheerleader, and the base is 576 inches + 60 inches = 636 inches tall.

Now, we gotta convert that to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 636 inches / 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If we call the number of guests ""x"", we can set up an equation to see when the costs are the same.

Venue 1 costs $200 plus $5 per guest, so that's 200 + 5x.

Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, so that's 25x.

To find when they're equal, we set them equal to each other: 200 + 5x = 25x

Subtract 5x from both sides: 200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20: x = 10

So, they'll cost the same if Mark invites 10 guests.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds, and we know it takes burning 3500 calories to lose one pound. That means he needs to burn a total of 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories.

Now, he has until July 19th, and today is December 31st.  Counting the days, that gives him about 200 days to reach his goal.

To figure out his daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days: 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories per day.

So, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Julie starts with $500. She spends 20% on clothes, so that's $500 * 0.20 = $100 gone.  That leaves her with $500 - $100 = $400. Then she spends 25% of that on CDs, which is $400 * 0.25 = $100.  So, she has $400 - $100 = $300 left.

$300 

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the house cost three times as much as the lot, think of it like this: the lot is one part, and the house is three parts. That makes a total of four parts.  Since the whole thing costs $120,000, one part is worth $120,000 / 4 = $30,000.  The house, being three parts, cost 3 * $30,000 = $90,000.

$90,000 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Tara bought 8 packs of bags, and each pack had 5 bags, so that's 8 * 5 = 40 bags total. She spent $4 on each pack, meaning she spent 8 * $4 = $32 on all the bags.

She sold each bag for $8, so she made 40 * $8 = $320.  

To find her profit, we subtract her costs from her earnings: $320 - $32 = $288.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ali has four $10 bills, which is $40, and six $20 bills, which is $120. That means he has a total of $160.

He gives half of that to his sister, so he gives away $80. That leaves him with $80.

Then he spends 3/5 of that $80 on dinner, which is $48.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has $32 left. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Rob takes 2 hours, that's 120 minutes. Double that is 240 minutes. Royce takes 40 minutes longer than that, so he takes 280 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Martha's making a lot of stuff!  

* Each grandchild needs 2 skeins for a hat + 4 for a scarf + 12 for a sweater + 1 for mittens + 2 for socks = 21 skeins total.
* Since she has 3 grandkids, that's 21 skeins/grandchild * 3 grandchildren = 63 skeins.

She'll need 63 skeins of wool. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Chris is a busy guy!

* He did 12 problems on Monday.
* Tuesday he did 3 times that, so 12 * 3 = 36 problems.
* That's a total of 12 + 36 = 48 problems done.
* He started with 100, so he had 100 - 48 = 52 left.
* On Wednesday, he powered through 52 / 4 = 13 problems.
* That leaves him with 52 - 13 = 39 problems for Thursday.

Looks like Chris still has 39 problems to tackle!

"Hey there!  Let me see... if one person takes 5 days to paint half a house, that means they paint 1/10 of the house each day.  With five people, they'd paint 5 times faster, so that's 1/2 the house per day.  So, it would take them 2 days to paint the whole house. That's 48 hours! 



"
"Alright, let's break this down. Ophelia's got 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she must have 22 chairs. Jenna has three times as many chairs as Ophelia, meaning she's got 66 chairs.  Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 64 sofas.  

Adding up all the sofas, Ophelia's 20 plus Jenna's 64 gives us 84 sofas.  Adding up all the chairs, Ophelia's 22 plus Jenna's 66 gives us 88 chairs.

In total, they have 84 sofas + 88 chairs = 172 sofas and chairs.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

We start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 get off, and then 40 get on (5 times the number who got off). That means there are 80 people on the bus after the first stop.

Then, at the second stop, 21 people get off, and only 2 get on (3 times fewer than those who got off at the first stop).  

So, after the second stop, there are 61 people left on the bus.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

The computer cost $1100, and the printer cost $700 less, so the printer was $400. Together, the computer and printer cost $1500. That means the two monitors cost $900 ($2400 - $1500 = $900).  

Since there are two monitors, one monitor costs $450 ($900 / 2 = $450).

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Since there were two equal groups of boys and girls, each group had 20 kids / 2 = 10 kids.

The boys found 60 shells each, so they brought back a total of 10 boys * 60 shells/boy = 600 shells.

The girls found the same amount as the boys plus four times that amount, so they found 600 shells + (4 * 600 shells) = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells.

That means each girl found 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells per girl.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Elvis wants to save $1125 this month, and he wants to save double in the second half of April compared to the first. Since April has 30 days, that means 15 days in each half.

He needs to save $1125 / 2 = $562.50 in the second half of the month.

To hit that goal, he needs to save $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50 each day in the second half of April.

Think of it like this: the blue jelly beans are our starting point.  Since there are 4500 total, and we need to split them up with those percentages, the blue jelly beans must be a nice round number.  

Let's say there are 1500 blue jelly beans. That means there are 1485 red ones (1% less) and 1515 green ones (1% more).

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans!

Jared starts at 47 WPM, then goes up to 52 WPM. If he increases by another 5, he'll be at 57 WPM. To find the average, we add those three speeds together (47 + 52 + 57 = 156) and then divide by 3 (156 / 3 = 52).

So the average of his typing speeds is 52 WPM.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Martin eats Cheerios, he loses 1.25 pounds a week, so over 5 weeks, that's 1.25 * 5 = 6.25 pounds gone.  But if he eats donuts, he gains 1.75 pounds a week, meaning he'd gain 1.75 * 5 = 8.75 pounds.  

The difference between gaining weight and losing weight is 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Alex invited 100 people, and each of them brings 2 friends, so that's 100 * 2 = 200 friends.  That's a total of 300 people from the emails. Then she invites 10 more friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses, adding another 8 people. So, in total, Alex needs 300 + 10 + 8 = 318 seats.

"Alright, let's break this down. The Dachshund weighs twice the Affenpinscher, so that's 10 pounds * 2 = 20 pounds. The Papillon is a quarter the weight of the Dachshund, meaning it weighs 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds. Finally, the Mastiff is a whopping 44 times heavier than the Papillon, so it weighs 5 pounds * 44 = 220 pounds.

So the answer is 3 days. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms a day and each 100 grams has 3 grams of protein, that means he's getting 6 grams of protein per day (200 / 100 * 3 = 6). Over a week, that adds up to 42 grams of protein (6 * 7 = 42).

"Hey there!  Let's break this triangle problem down.

Think of the smallest angle as ""x"".  The next angle is double that, so it's ""2x"". The biggest angle is triple the smallest, making it ""3x"".

Remember, all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. So, we have:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining those 'x's, we get:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6 to find 'x':

x = 30

Now, to find the biggest angle, multiply the smallest angle by 3:

3 * 30 = 90

So the largest angle is 90 degrees.

"Hey there! Let's see... Colby's got a lot of coins!  

First, we gotta figure out how much money he has. Eight quarters are worth two dollars, six dimes are sixty cents, fourteen nickels are seventy cents, and fifteen pennies are fifteen cents.  Add that all up, and he's got three dollars and forty-five cents.

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is five cents, he can buy a whole bunch!  Three dollars and forty-five cents is the same as sixty-nine nickels.

So the answer is 69.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Patrick made.

He sold 15 cups an hour for four hours, so that's 15 * 4 = 60 cups. At $0.50 each, he made 60 * $0.50 = $30.00.

Then he sold 10 cups an hour for two hours, which is 10 * 2 = 20 cups. At $0.60 each, that's 20 * $0.60 = $12.00.

Adding those together, Patrick made $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00 selling lemonade.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  If the tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, that's a lot of rotations!  

Each tire can handle 10,440,000 rotations before needing a swap. So, we gotta see how many months those tires will last.

Hmm, 400 miles a month times 725 rotations per 2 miles... that's 145,000 rotations every month.

Now, divide the total rotations a tire can handle by the rotations per month: 10,440,000 rotations / 145,000 rotations/month = 72 months.

That's 6 years before those tires need replacing!

"Alright, let's break this down.  If the bottle gives you 120 washes with 2 pumps, that means one pump lasts for 120 washes / 2 = 60 washes.  So, the bottle will last Jackie 60 washes.

That means each wash costs $24.00 / 60 washes = $0.40. Since she uses one pump per wash, each pump costs 40 cents.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Joe's got $50, and that 30% off sale is pretty sweet. The shirt is $25, and with the discount, that's $25 - ($25 * 0.30) = $17.50. The shorts are $35, so after the discount, they're $35 - ($35 * 0.30) = $24.50.

Adding those up, his total is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.

That means Joe has $50 - $42.00 = $8.00 left over.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

It costs $194 per meter to repave a street. Monica's street is 150 meters long, so repaving it would cost $194 * 150 = $29100.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so repaving his street would cost $194 * 490 = $95060.

The difference in cost is $95060 - $29100 = $65960.

"Alright, let's figure this out. John's research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so that's 50 months total.  After those first 5 months, his funding went up by 50% each month.  

So, the first 5 months cost him 5 * $100,000 = $500,000.

The rest of the time, he was paying $100,000 + ($100,000 * 0.50) = $150,000 per month. That's 45 months * $150,000 = $6,750,000.

Adding those together, his total research cost was $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

Over a year, that's 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks/year = 2080 gallons.

Since water costs $0.15 per gallon, his yearly laundry water bill is 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

* The coral was $2.00 each, and she bought 3 pieces, so that's $2.00 * 3 = $6.00.
* The fish were $0.50 each, and she bought 20, so that's $0.50 * 20 = $10.00.
* The fish food cost $2.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

The auditorium has 4 rows with 18 seats each, so that's 4 * 18 = 72 seats total.

The administrators took up 1/4 of the seats, which is 72 * (1/4) = 18 seats.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

Parents filled 1/3 of those, meaning they took 54 * (1/3) = 18 seats.

Finally, the students got the rest, so there were 54 - 18 = 36 students.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

First, we need to know how many kilobytes (kb) are in a megabyte (Mb): there are 1000 kb in 1 Mb. So, Ashley's speed of 20 kb per second is equal to 0.02 Mb per second (20 / 1000 = 0.02).

Now, to get her speed in Mb per hour, we need to do some more conversions. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. So, there are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 * 60 = 3600).

Finally, multiply her speed in Mb per second by the number of seconds in an hour: 0.02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

* A third of a pound of walnuts is $5 (a third of $15).
* That mix costs $10 total.

Second mix:

* A fifth of a pound of almonds is $2 (a fifth of $10).
* A third of a pound of walnuts is still $5.
* That mix costs $7 total.

The difference in price is $3 ($10 - $7).

"Hey there! This is a classic animal problem. Let's break it down.

We know each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2.  We also know there are 20 heads in total.

Think of it like this: if all the animals were sheep, we'd have 80 legs (20 heads x 4 legs). Since we only have 70 legs, some of those heads must belong to geese.

Let's try subtracting legs to see how many ""extra"" legs we have if we assume all 20 heads are sheep: 80 - 70 = 10 extra legs.

Since each goose has 2 fewer legs than a sheep, those 10 extra legs represent 5 geese (10 / 2 = 5).

If there are 5 geese, there must be 15 sheep (20 total heads - 5 geese = 15 sheep).

"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, the coffee Roger usually buys is $5 a pound. But since his favorite is out, he has to get the fancy stuff, which is 20% more. That means the expensive coffee is $5 + ($5 * 0.20) = $6 a pound.

He drinks a pound a day, so for a week (7 days) that's 7 pounds of coffee, costing him 7 * $6 = $42.

Don't forget the donut! That's another $2.

In total, Roger spent $42 + $2 = $44.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Gus spent $20.00 total, and we know the chips were $4.00, the chicken was $8.00, and the soda was $1.00.  That means the apple pie cost $7.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If James delivers 600 newspapers total and we know 198 go to District A and 209 go to District C, we can find out how many go to District B by subtracting those amounts from the total.

600 - 198 - 209 = 193

So James delivers 193 newspapers to District B. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  John's in class for 4 days a week times 2 hours a day, so that's 8 hours a week. Over 6 weeks, that's 8 times 6, which is 48 hours total. Since he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours, he'll learn 48 divided by 1.5, which is 32 recipes.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

So, 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, which means there are 90 history teachers. That leaves 60 math teachers.

Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, all the math teachers together sleep for 360 hours in a day.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we gotta see how much Kassidy has. Aurelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 of that, so Kassidy has (3/4) * $120 = $90.

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so she has $90 + $60 = $150.

Altogether, they have $120 + $90 + $150 = $360.

If they split that evenly, each person gets $360 / 3 = $120.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, and Janey has 21 books, we can set up an equation. Let's say Sally has 'x' books. Twice the number of Sally's books is 2x, and 3 more than that is 2x + 3.  We know this equals 21, so 2x + 3 = 21.  

Subtract 3 from both sides to get 2x = 18, then divide both sides by 2 to find x = 9.

Sally has 9 books. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we gotta know how many inches the bamboo needs to grow. It's already 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches (20 x 12).  We want it to be 600 inches tall, so it needs to grow another 360 inches (600 - 240).

Since it grows 30 inches every day, it'll take 12 days to reach 600 inches (360 / 30).

"Alright, let's figure this out. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he needs 8 more toys for the 8 new pups. Then, the number of dogs doubles, meaning he needs 16 more toys! That's a total of 24 toys. But wait, 3 dogs leave, so he doesn't need those 3 toys anymore.  

So, James needs 21 toys in total.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Jack and 8 other adults are in the elevator, that's a total of 9 adults.  Since each adult weighs about 80 kg, their combined weight is 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

The elevator can only handle 700 kg, so they're going over by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer's got a sweet tooth! She has 23 more cookies than Max, so she has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the dress is 140cm long after adding 20cm of lace and extending the original length by 50%, we need to work backwards.

Think of it like this: 140cm is the total length, and 20cm of that is just the lace. That means the dress was 140cm - 20cm = 120cm long before the lace.

Now, since the 120cm length represents 150% of the original (100% + 50% increase), we can find the original length by dividing: 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.


So the original dress was 80cm long.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

We know one twin is older than one of the triplets by 7 years.  If we add up all their ages, it equals 44.  

To figure out how old one of the twins is, we gotta do some thinking.  Since there are two twins and three triplets, that's five people in total.

Let's think of it like this:

*  If all five were the same age, they'd each be 44 / 5 = 8.8 years old.

* But one twin is older by 7 years, so that twin must be 8.8 + 7 = 15.8 years old.

But wait! We can't have part of a year.  That means we need to adjust our thinking a bit.  

Let me know if you want to try working through it together!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"
"Hey there! Let's break down the cost of that fruit crate. 

So, we've got 5 bananas, and each banana costs twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50. That means each banana is $1.00.  Then we have 12 apples at $0.50 each, and 7 oranges. Oranges are the priciest at three times the cost of a banana, so they're $3.00 a pop.

Let's add it all up:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Total cost: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Brittany's got 14 red squares, then 4 more blue, so that's 18 blue squares.  Then 6 more green than blue, making it 24 green squares.  Finally, 12 fewer white than green, so 12 white squares.  Add 'em all up: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, her comforter is 68 square feet.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Mia needs enough chairs for all the adults and babies.  She's got 8 high chairs, and those are for the little ones. Since she has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, that means she has 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.  

In total, she has 40 + 8 = 48 chairs. But she needs enough for 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people.  

So, Mia needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

Tom has 30 less than Betty, putting him at 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta collected triple Tom's amount, meaning she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding everyone's points together, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 - 255 = 145 more points for their trip.

* And those blueberry muffins add up to 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

That's a subtotal of $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

So, James spent $20 to get in and then $1.50 for every pound of blueberries. He got 30 pounds, so that's 30 * $1.50 = $45 just for the berries.  

Adding the entry fee, his total cost was $45 + $20 = $65.

If he bought them at the store, it would have cost him $2.50 a pound, so that's 30 * $2.50 = $75.

Bryce and two of his buddies ate two-thirds of their pizzas, so that's 24 slices gone (2/3 * 12 slices/pizza * 3 pizzas = 24 slices). The other two friends ate three-quarters of their pizzas, which is another 18 slices (3/4 * 12 slices/pizza * 2 pizzas = 18 slices).  

That means they ate a total of 42 slices (24 + 18 = 42).

"Alright, let's break this down. Hannah's having a rough time, huh?  

So, she smashes windows on a quarter of the student cars, which is 64 cars / 4 = 16 cars. Since each student car has 4 windows, that's 16 cars * 4 windows/car = 64 windows.

Then she goes after the teachers' cars, smashing windows on 3/4 of them. That's 32 cars * (3/4) = 24 cars. With 2 windows per teacher car, that's 24 cars * 2 windows/car = 48 windows.

Adding it all up, Hannah smashes a total of 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.

"Hey there!  If Greg splits $20 equally with his 3 siblings, that means there are 4 people sharing the money (Greg plus his 3 siblings). So, each person would get $5! 



"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Her math and science books are 2 pounds each, so those are 2 + 2 = 4 pounds. Her French book is 4 pounds and her English book is 3 pounds. Her history book is double her English book, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 pounds.  Adding it all up: 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, who got 20%. That means B got 20 + (50/100)*20 = 30% of the votes.  Together, A and B got 20% + 30% = 50% of the votes. That leaves 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes for candidate C. Since there were 100 voters, candidate C got 50% of 100, which is 50 votes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Boris starts with 100 apples, and Beck has 23 less, so Beck has 77.  If Boris gives Beck 10, Beck will have 87, and Boris will have 90. That means Boris has 3 more apples than Beck.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Peter uses 12 ounces for the giant cubes, 14 ounces for the medium cubes, and 4 ounces for the small cubes. That's a total of 30 ounces. Since he started with 32 ounces, he has 2 ounces left over.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Clara has 20 books, and that's twice the number Steven has. So Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books. Alice has 6 more books than Steven, meaning she has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  That means Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. A gallon jar costs $5, and a half-gallon jar costs $3.  So, 10 gallon jars would cost 10 * $5 = $50. And 16 half-gallon jars would cost 16 * $3 = $48.  Adding those together, Cecelia spent a total of $50 + $48 = $98.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, 10 students like baking, 5 like basketball, and the rest are into video games or music. We know the music lovers are double the basketball fans, meaning 5 * 2 = 10 students like music.

That leaves 50 - 10 - 5 - 10 = 25 students who must like video games.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down. If each class has the same number of students, that means there are 80 students / 2 classes = 40 students in each class.

If 40% are girls, then there are 40 students * 0.40 = 16 girls in each class.

That leaves 40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys in each class.

"Alright, let's break this down. Mark spent 3 * $1800 = $5400 on those packs.  He lucked out and got a $4000 card and a $1000 card, so that's $5000 right there. Plus, he got 30 more cards worth $50 each, for a total of 30 * $50 = $1500.  

So, he made $5000 + $1500 = $6500 selling the cards.  

That means his profit was $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save. 

At the first park, two adults would cost 2 * $26 = $52, and two kids would cost 2 * $12 = $24. That's a total of $52 + $24 = $76.

At the second park, two adults would cost 2 * $14 = $28, and two kids would cost 2 * $10 = $20.  That's a total of $28 + $20 = $48.

The family would save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. Sean has 56 marbles, and Cal has twice that amount, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times the number Sean has, meaning Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.  

To find the total, we add Carl's and Cal's marbles: 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

"
"Hey there!  

To figure this out, we need to see how many students would be in each group if we had 12 groups. Since there are 54 students, and we want 6 groups, each group would have 9 students (54 / 6 = 9).

If we had 12 groups, we'd need 108 students (12 x 9 = 108).  That means we need 54 more students to make 12 groups (108 - 54 = 54).

But the question asks how many *more groups* we need, not how many more students. Since each group has 9 students, we need 6 more groups (54 / 9 = 6).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Candy rents out 60 chairs per day on weekdays, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 chairs per week. On weekends, she rents 100 chairs per day, meaning 100 * 2 = 200 chairs per weekend.

That's a total of 300 + 200 = 500 chairs per week.

In a month with 4 weeks, she'd rent out 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs.

Over two months, she'd rent out 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jeff started with 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 * 12 = 96 glasses. He also had 4 dozen plates, meaning 4 * 12 = 48 plates.  

After the party, he lost 10 glasses and 6 plates. That leaves him with 96 - 10 = 86 glasses and 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

In total, Jeff has 86 + 42 = 128 glasses and plates left.

"
"Alright, let's break this sticker and button trade down. Lorraine's got a lot of swapping to do!

First, she trades 90% of her small stickers, which is 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.  Each of those gets her a small button, so that's 27 buttons right there. And she can trade those 27 small buttons for 9 large buttons (27 / 3 = 9).

Next, she trades half of her large stickers, which is 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers. Each of those is worth a large button, so that's another 20 large buttons.

She's still got 20 large stickers left.  Those can be traded for 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

Adding it all up, Lorraine ends up with 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Joey played 2 games on Monday, 1 on Friday, and double the Monday amount on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 games.

"Alright, let's figure this out!

*  Krissa needs 11 extra-small shirts.
* Twice that many, or 11 * 2 = 22 shirts, are small.
* Four less than the small shirts, or 22 - 4 = 18 shirts, are medium.
* Half the number of medium shirts, or 18 / 2 = 9 shirts, are large.
* Six more than the large shirts, or 9 + 6 = 15 shirts, are extra-large.

Adding all those up: 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.

Krissa needs to order 75 shirts.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

First, figure out how many folks are rooting for horse #2: 20% of 50 people is 10 people.

That leaves us with 40 people.  Then, 60% of those folks like horse #7, which is 24 people.

Finally, subtract those who like horse #7 from the remaining people to find out how many are cheering for horse #12: 40 - 24 = 16 people.

So the answer is 16.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the third house needs double the first, and all three houses need 250 cases total, we gotta think about how the shingles are split up.  

Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases. The first house needs half of that, so x/2 cases. The third house needs double the first, so another x cases.

That means x/2 + x + x = 250 cases total.

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 2.5x = 250.

Divide both sides by 2.5, and we find out x, the number of cases for the second house, is 100.

Since the third house needs the same as the second, it also needs 100 cases.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Ezra read a whopping 300 books, and that's twice as many as Ahmed. So Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books. Ezra then reads another 150, bringing his total to 300 + 150 = 450 books.  

Altogether, they read 450 + 150 = 600 books.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Tanya made.

On Monday, she taught 4 classes for 5 hours, so she earned $15/hour * 5 hours = $75. Plus, since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5 bonus, bringing her Monday total to $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, she taught 2 classes for 2 hours, earning $15/hour * 2 hours = $30. No bonus for her on Wednesday.

Adding up both days, Tanya made $80 + $30 = $110.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

Jack drives 150 miles each way, so that's 300 miles total. At 75 mph, that's 300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours of driving.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Henry needs 4 wheels for each of his 57 cars, so that's 57 * 4 = 228 wheels.

For his 73 motorcycles, he'll need 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.

In total, he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.

If he starts with 650 wheels, he'll have 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left over.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Mike's got a big collection!

So, a third of his 600 movies are in series, which is 200 movies. Since he can get those as a bundle for a discount, they'll cost him $666.67.

That leaves him with 400 movies that aren't in a series.  Of those, 40% are older movies, so that's 160 movies at $5 each, totaling $800.

The rest of the movies, 240 of them, are newer and cost the full $10 each, so that's $2400.

Adding it all up: $666.67 + $800 + $2400 = $3866.67.

Looks like replacing his collection will cost Mike $3866.67. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Winston spent.

Peaches cost $2.00 a pound, and he got 6 pounds, so that's $2.00 * 6 = $12.00.

Plums are $1.00 a pound, and he got 8 pounds, so that's $1.00 * 8 = $8.00.

Apricots are $3.00 a pound, and he got 6 pounds, so that's $3.00 * 6 = $18.00.

Adding it all up, he spent $12.00 + $8.00 + $18.00 = $38.00 on fruit.

"Hey there! This sounds like a fun competition.  

To figure out the difference in their scores, we need to think about all the ways they earn points.  

* **Enemies:** Ava gets 10 points per enemy, and she jumps on 8 more than Emma.
* **Berries:** Ava gets 5 points per berry and collects 3 more than Emma.
* **Time:** Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so Emma gets 30 points for those extra seconds.

Since we don't know how many enemies they jump on or berries they collect, or how much time they have left, we can't get an exact number for the difference.  

It'll depend on those specific details!

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Bob starts with 3 orange and 4 white fish. He buys some more, and ends up with twice as many orange as white.  

Think of it like this: if he has 'x' white fish after the purchase, he has '2x' orange fish.  

We know he bought 17 fish total, so the number of orange fish he bought plus the number of white fish he bought equals 17.

Let's use some algebra!

* Orange fish after the purchase: 3 + (17 - white fish bought)
* White fish after the purchase: 4 + white fish bought

We know orange fish after = 2 * white fish after

So: 3 + (17 - white fish bought) = 2 * (4 + white fish bought)

Simplify and solve for the number of white fish bought. You'll find Bob bought 4 white fish. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Andy drives 10 miles a day to work and back, so that's 50 miles a week (10 miles/day * 5 days/week).  Since his car gets 10 miles per gallon, he'll use 5 gallons of gas each week (50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons). With gas at $3 a gallon, that's a total of $15 a week.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  If it's 33 degrees colder at night, that means it'll be 12 degrees (45 - 33 = 12).  To keep the pipes from freezing, he needs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees (32 - 12 = 20). Since each log warms things up by 5 degrees, he'll need to burn 4 logs (20 / 5 = 4).

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  They had 90 people and split them into groups of 9, so that's 10 groups total.  Three-fifths of those groups, or 6 groups, brought back 2 seashells each person.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, we start with 172 people. Then 47 get off, and 13 hop on. That means there are 172 - 47 + 13 = 138 people left.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jamie makes $20 an hour for her first 8 hours. That's $20 * 8 = $160. Since she worked 3 extra hours, she gets paid time and a half for those, which is $20 * 1.5 = $30 an hour. So her overtime pay is $30 * 3 = $90.  Adding that to her regular pay, she made $160 + $90 = $250 for the day.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Billy's been hustlin'! He started at $10 an hour, got a $0.50 bump after two months, and then another $1.00 raise a year in. That puts him at $11.50 an hour now.

Sally's just starting out, making $0.50 more than Billy did at the beginning, so she's at $10.50 an hour.

If they both work 20 hours, Billy makes $11.50 * 20 = $230. Sally makes $10.50 * 20 = $210.

So, Billy earns $20 more than Sally.

Now, let's add up all the students who passed: 340 third graders + 40 fourth graders + 320 fifth graders = 700 students.

Finally, divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students: 700 / 1000 = 0.7 or 70%.

The school's overall pass rate is 70%.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Milo needs 12 chips per square inch, and his mosaic is gonna be 3 inches tall. That means he needs 12 chips/inch * 3 inches = 36 chips for every inch of length. He's got two bags with 72 chips each, so that's 2 bags * 72 chips/bag = 144 chips total.  

So, he can make his mosaic 144 chips / 36 chips/inch = 4 inches long.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Those students sure love their tea!

So, four students drank 1.5 quarts each, that's 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts. Then we have 16 students chugging down 2 quarts each, so that's 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.

In total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.

Since there are 10 quarts left, they must have started with 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.

And since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, they had 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea at the beginning.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Dale started with 100 candies, then got 100 more, so that's 200 candies total. He already sold 150, so he has 200 - 150 = 50 candies left to sell.

"
"Hey there! This is a fun one. Let me see... if the student body doubles every month, by the end of May, there would be a whole lot more students!  

Here's how I figured it out:

* Starting with 10 students, they double to 20, then 40, then 80, then 160, and finally 320 by the end of May.

That means 310 extra students joined!

"
"Hey there! This sounds like a pretty cool gig Felix has going.  

Let's see... he made $105 and each branch costs $.25 to climb. That means he climbed a total of $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches.

If he worked 5 days, that's an average of 420 branches / 5 days = 84 branches per day.

"
"Alright, let's see... Rose picked a bunch of flowers!  She started with 3 flowers that had 5 petals each, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 petals. Then she got 4 flowers with 6 petals each, so that's 4 times 6, or 24 petals.  She added 5 more flowers with 4 petals each, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 petals. Finally, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, so that's 6 times 7, or 42 petals.

Now, she dropped one of each kind of flower, so that's 5 petals lost.  

Let me add up all the petals she has left: 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 - 5 = 96 petals.


96 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. They used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows for their s'mores.  Oops, they also dropped 3! That means they have 35 - 18 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left. Since each s'more needs one marshmallow, they can each have 14 / 2 = 7 more s'mores.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter. His buddies who aren't as good only get 10 minutes per quarter, and the really good one gets 30 minutes.  They play for 4 hours straight, which is 240 minutes.

So, Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.

The weaker players each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, and there are two of them, so that's 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.

The good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

Adding it all up, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

That means they spend 68 * $0.25 = $17.00 at the arcade. 


$17.00
"
"Alright, let's break this down.  Tanya's got a good thing going with that salt scrub!  

Since she uses the same amount of zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar, let's think of those as pairs.  She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  That means oil is four times the amount of zest.

If we think of the zest as 1 part, the salt is 2 parts, the sugar is 2 parts, the fragrance is 1 part, and the oil is 4 parts. That's a total of 10 parts.

If each part is represented by 1 ounce, then the oil is 4 ounces.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Joe has twice the cars Robert has, and Robert has 20. So Joe starts with 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

He sells 20% of those, which is 0.20 * 40 = 8 cars.

Then he gives his mom twice that amount, so 2 * 8 = 16 cars go to his mom.

In total, he gives away 8 + 16 = 24 cars.

That leaves Joe with 40 - 24 = 16 cars.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If the charity got $50,000 from organizations, that means the students raised $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.  Since there are 20 students, each student raised $125,000 / 20 = $6,250. 


$6,250
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Sandy walked for 8 hours the first day and half that time, which is 4 hours, on the second day. That's a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours of walking.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she walked for 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. John does a lot of work! 

He makes $6.00 for each cycle (5 tasks x $1.20 per task).  Since he does 30 cycles a day, that's $180.00 per day. Over a whole week, he earns $1260.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Sasha scored 14 points in the first game, and Julie scored 4 less than that, so she got 10 points. In the second game, Sasha scored 6 less than Julie's first game score, meaning she scored 4 points.  

Adding up Sasha's points from both games, we get 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Kimberly bought a lot of pet food!  She got 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food. She also got 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins each, for a total of 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.  To find the difference, we subtract: 88 - 36 = 52.

Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

We know there are 341 cards total. Let's say PJ has 'x' number of cards. Smendrick has three times that, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to figure out 'x'.  We know:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

Now we know PJ has 47 cards.  Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.

Finally, Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Cindy had 5 green eggs, and twice that many blue ones, so she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs. She had one less pink egg than blue eggs, meaning she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  Adding them all up, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So Milly's gotta ship back this dud of a book. Shipping's gonna cost her $0.35 per pound, and the book's a hefty 4 pounds. That's $1.40 right there. Then there's the mileage - $0.08 per mile for 20 miles, so another $1.60.  

Amazon's only giving her back 75% of the $32 she spent, which is $24.  

Adding up the shipping ($1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00) and subtracting that from the refund and the original price, Milly's out $5.00.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Boris makes 50,000 chocolate bars a month. In week one, he makes 8,000. Week two is half of week one, so that's 4,000 bars. Week three is triple week one, meaning he makes 24,000 bars. That's a total of 36,000 bars for the first three weeks.  To hit his goal, he needs to make 14,000 bars in week four.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Britany makes a lot of TikToks!  

* First, her videos take up 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes.
* Then there's the songwriting, which is 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.
* And don't forget the makeup, which is 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes.

That's a total of 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes per week on TikTok.

Over a month, that's 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes.

Finally, let's turn that into hours: 1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18.8 hours.

So Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok each month.

"Hey there! Let's figure out Angela's installation cost. 

The base installation is $129.00.  She needs 2 extra mirrors at $15.00 each, so that's $30.00. She also has one extra chandelier for another $15.00. And for the extra pictures, that's 10 pictures * $15.00/picture = $150.00.

Adding it all up: $129.00 + $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $324.00

"Alright, let's break this down.  Pompei lifts a measly inch. Saskay is a beast and lifts 12 times that, so Saskay lifts 12 inches. Kagiyami is even stronger, lifting 4 times what Saskay can, meaning Kagiyami lifts 48 inches. Now, Naruto is the real powerhouse, lifting 10 times what Kagiyami can, so Naruto lifts a whopping 480 inches!  

But we need feet, not inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... Mason travels 8 miles every hour.  He bikes for 4 hours, then rests, and then bikes for another 6 hours.  So that's 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours of biking total.

If he bikes 8 miles each hour for 10 hours, he travels 8 * 10 = 80 miles.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Three kangaroos take 18 hours, so one kangaroo would take three times as long, which is 54 hours.  That means one kangaroo travels at a speed of 1 highway length every 54 hours.

Now, those turtles are slowpokes, only half as fast as a kangaroo. So, each turtle takes twice as long, meaning 108 hours for one turtle to cross.

With four turtles, their combined speed is four times faster than one turtle. That means it'll take them 108 hours / 4 = 27 hours.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Kora made 20 dishes, and Rory made 20 more than that, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, meaning she made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.

To find the total, we add up the number of dishes each person made: 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If each glue stick starts at 12 millimeters, we need to find out how much is left over from each one and add those amounts together.

* The first stick has 5/6 left, so that's (5/6) * 12 mm = 10 mm unused.
* The second stick has 1/3 left, so that's (1/3) * 12 mm = 4 mm unused.
* The third stick has 1/2 left, so that's (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm unused.

Adding those up, we get 10 mm + 4 mm + 6 mm = 20 mm.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Jack has 60 dishes, and that's twice the number of socks he has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.

Peter has double the socks Jack has, meaning he has 30 * 2 = 60 socks.

Peter has half the number of dishes Jack has, so he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.

Altogether, they have 60 + 30 = 90 socks and 30 + 60 = 90 dishes.

That means they have a total of 90 + 90 = 180 socks and dishes.

"Hey there! This age puzzle is kinda tricky, but I think I got it.  

Let me see... I'm three years younger than my brother, so if I'm *x* years old, he's *x + 3*. I'm also two years older than my sister, making her *x - 2*. My mom's age is a bit more complicated - it's one less than three times my brother's age, so that's *3(x + 3) - 1*.

If we add all our ages together, it equals 87. So, *x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3(x + 3) - 1) = 87*.

Solving that equation gives me... *x = 11*.

"Alright, let's break this down. Claire gets a badge every month, right? Amber takes twice as long, so she gets one every two months. That means in a year, she gets 12 months / 2 months/badge = 6 badges. Wendy's a rockstar, getting three times as many as Claire, so she gets 1 badge/month * 3 = 3 badges a month, or 36 badges in a year.  

So, Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Think of it like this:

* Fawn has 'F' books.
* Anne has 'F - 12' books because she has 12 fewer than Fawn.
* Sofie has 'F + 13' books because she has 25 more than Anne (who has 12 fewer than Fawn).

All together, they have 85 books, so:

F + (F - 12) + (F + 13) = 85

Simplify that: 3F + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides: 3F = 84

Divide both sides by 3: F = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Paul starts with 52 marbles, gets 28 more, so that's 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  But then he loses a quarter of them, which is 80 / 4 = 20 marbles.  That means he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.

"Alright, let's break this down. Amy's got a good handle on her history!

* She nails 80% of the multiple-choice, so that's 10 questions * 0.80 = 8 questions right.  Those are worth 1 point each, so that's 8 points.
* On the true/false, she gets 90%, meaning 20 questions * 0.90 = 18 correct.  Another point each, so that's 18 points.
* The long answer is trickier, but she still gets 60%, or 5 questions * 0.60 = 3 right. Those are worth 5 points a pop, for a total of 15 points.

Adding it all up: 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points. 

Not bad, Amy!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Isaias wants to make a $2000 profit, and he's selling each chicken for $50.  He's selling 3/5 of his 300 chickens, which is 180 chickens. That means he'll make 180 chickens * $50/chicken = $9000 from the sales.

To find out how much he paid for the chickens, we subtract his desired profit: $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

So, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000. 


$7000
"
"Hey there!  Let's see... Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold the rest, which is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. Since they sold the same amount, each boy sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses. That means Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  Iris spent $100 on her manicure (since that's a quarter of her hair cost) and $75 on her pedicure (three-quarters of the manicure price).  Adding those to her $400 hair appointment, her total spa day cost is $575.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Sarah makes $40 from selling her rope (20 meters * $2/meter).  The new rope costs her $30 (20 meters * $1.5/meter). That means she'll have $10 left over ($40 - $30).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Melanie's gonna be 18 in 10 years, that means she's 8 years old now.  To be three times her current age, she'd need to be 24.  That means it'll take her another 16 years.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left.

First, each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each chicken pack costs $10 / 5 * 2 = $4.

That means 6 packs of chicken cost $4 * 6 = $24.

Apple packs are half the price of strawberries, so each apple pack costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Seven packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

Three packs of strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Adding it all up, Kelly's total cost is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Since Kelly has a budget of $65, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual ones plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can work backwards.  

First, take away the encore: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That 50 minutes is double the length of a regular concert, so divide it in half: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

So, Elaina's usual concerts are 25 minutes long.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  The daisies have way more petals than the orchids.  

The orchids have 5 petals each, and Joelle has 5 of them, so that's 5 * 5 = 25 petals.

The daisies have 10 petals each, and she has 4, so that's 10 * 4 = 40 petals.

The daisies have 40 - 25 = 15 more petals than the orchids.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Mrs. Smith has 100 plants. A quarter of them are inside, which is 25 plants (100 / 4 = 25). That leaves 75 plants left (100 - 25 = 75).

Two-thirds of those are outdoor plants, so that's 50 outdoor plants (75 x (2/3) = 50).

That means the rest, 25 plants, must be flowering plants (75 - 50 = 25).

To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100: (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  The whatchamacallit is a real speed demon, huh?  121 meters per second!  It's eleven times faster than that slowpoke thingamabob. So the thingamabob is doing 121 divided by 11, which is 11 meters per second. Now, the whirligig is five times faster than the thingamabob, so it's zipping along at 11 times 5, or 55 meters per second.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Anis rowed 1/5 more than Dijana's 50 miles, which is an extra 10 miles (50 * 1/5 = 10).  That means Anis rowed a total of 60 miles (50 + 10 = 60).  

Together they rowed 110 miles (50 + 60 = 110).

That's a total of 300 lollipops * $0.80/lollipop = $240 earned.

But they spent 300 lollipops * $0.50/lollipop = $150 to buy them.

So their profit is $240 - $150 = $90.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out how many pets Larry has.  He's got 3 cats, and 3 times that many dogs, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, meaning he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.  His fish tank has 3 times the number of rabbits, so that's 7 * 3 = 21 fish. Finally, he has 1/3 the number of gerbils as fish, which is 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Adding them all up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Colby's got $150 for movies this month. He already spent some on tickets and snacks, so we gotta see how much he has left.

He saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays at $10 each, so that's 5 * $10 = $50.

He saw 8 movies on other days at $7 each, so that's 8 * $7 = $56.

He bought 2 popcorns at $8 each, so that's 2 * $8 = $16.

And he got 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so that's 4 * $2 = $8.

Adding all that up, he spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130.

That leaves him with $150 - $130 = $20.

Tonight's a Friday, and a movie, popcorn, and candy will cost him $10 + $8 + $2 = $20.

Looks like he can squeeze in **1** more movie tonight! 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

First, we gotta find out how many calories are in each mini pastry. A regular cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini one has 600 / 3 = 200 calories. A regular blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini one has 450 / 3 = 150 calories.

Now, let's multiply to find the total calories for each type:

* Cinnamon rolls: 200 rolls * 200 calories/roll = 40,000 calories
* Blueberry muffins: 300 muffins * 150 calories/muffin = 45,000 calories

Finally, add those together to get the total calories for all the pastries: 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Rita's got a Junebug problem! On Tuesday and Wednesday, she snagged 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs each day. That's a whopping 78 * 2 = 156 Junebugs for those two days alone!

Adding up all the days, she removed 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.

To find the average, we divide the total by the number of days: 300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.

We know Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100.  Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's and John's ages combined.

To figure out Peter's age, we can think like this:

* If Paul is 10 years older than John, let's say John is ""x"" years old. That means Paul is ""x + 10"" years old.
* Peter's age is Paul's age plus John's age, so Peter is (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10 years old.

Now, we know all their ages add up to 100: x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100

Let's solve for x:

* 4x + 20 = 100
* 4x = 80
* x = 20

So John is 20 years old.

Since Peter is 2x + 10, he's (2 * 20) + 10 = 50 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

The Widgeteer 3000 churns out 60 widgets an hour, so in a day, that's 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets. Over a whole month (30 days), it'd make 1440 * 30 = 43200 widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so daily that's 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets. In a month, it'd make 1080 * 30 = 32400 widgets.

Now, each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 would earn 43200 * $6 = $259200. The WidgetMaster 9000 would earn 32400 * $6 = $194400.

That means Fern would make $259200 - $194400 = $64800 more with the Widgeteer 3000.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Each sheep needs 2 times the amount of hay a goat needs (which is 5 pounds) minus 3 pounds, so that's 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.

So, the sheep need 12 sheep * 7 pounds/sheep = 84 pounds of hay.

The goats need 15 goats * 5 pounds/goat = 75 pounds of hay.

In total, Nate needs 84 pounds + 75 pounds = 159 pounds of hay.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. John makes a good chunk of change at 50 bucks an hour for 6 hours, so that's 300 dollars right off the bat.  He spends 50 on gas, and those pencils cost him another 50 bucks. That leaves him with 200 dollars. After he puts 100 in the bank, he's got 100 left for pens.  Since each pen is 25 dollars, he can snag 4 of them.

"Hey there! Let's break down Patty's charges.  

The visit cost $40, labor was 2.25 hours at $35 per hour, so that's $78.75. Plus, there were $60 in parts.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

James snagged 10 CDs at $15 a pop, so that's 10 * $15 = $150 originally.

But wait, there's a 40% discount! That means he saved $150 * 0.40 = $60.

So, he paid $150 - $60 = $90 for the CDs.

He then sells 5 of them for $40 each, making him $5 * $40 = $200.

In the end, James walks away with $200 - $90 = $110.

And finally, 4 carrots at $1.25 each, making 4 * $1.25 = $5.00.

Adding it all up: $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

Looks like Jen will earn $34.00 if she sells everything!

"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

Cayley gets $0.50 for every New York Times he sells (10% of $5) and $1.20 for every Wall Street Journal (8% of $15).

So, from the Times, he makes $3.00 (6 copies * $0.50). From the Journals, he makes $12.00 (10 copies * $1.20).

Adding those together, Cayley earns a total of $15.00 in commission.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Deanna is 26, and Marcus is 5 years younger than her, so Marcus is 21. Marcus is half Leo's age, meaning Leo is twice Marcus's age. That makes Leo 42 years old.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Bahati scored the most and had 20 more points than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar, we can use some algebra. Let's say Azibo scored 'x' points. That means Bahati scored x + 20 points, and Dinar scored x + 10 points.

Since their total score is 45, we can write the equation: x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45

Combining like terms, we get 3x + 30 = 45.

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 3x = 15.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find that x = 5.

So Azibo scored 5 points.

"Let me see... 15 hours of stapling is a lot!  Okay, so there are 60 minutes in an hour, so that's 900 minutes total. If he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, that means he does 60 sets of 15 minutes.  So, 60 sets times 30 reports per set... that's 1800 reports!

"Let's see... Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours, which is 480 minutes. She was sleepwalking for 23 minutes, so subtract that: 480 - 23 = 457 minutes.  And she woke up 5 minutes early, so subtract that too: 457 - 5 = 452 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jonathan has two dozen cups, which is 24 cups. He has 2/3 that many spoons, so he starts with 16 spoons. After giving 6 to Pedro, he has 10 spoons left.  That means he has 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils in total.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The hospital starts with 1000 beds and 1/5 are full, meaning 200 beds are occupied. That leaves 800 beds empty.

Over two weeks, they get 50 new patients each day, totaling 700 new patients (50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients).

Adding those to the initial occupied beds, we have 900 occupied beds (200 + 700 = 900).

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total beds gives us 100 unoccupied beds (1000 - 900 = 100).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. If Courtney overstated the crowd by 20%, that means the real number is 20% less than what she said.  

20% of 48 is 9.6.  So, we subtract that from Courtney's count: 48 - 9.6 = 38.4. Since we can't have part of a person, we round down.

"Ahoy, matey! Let's see... they dug 10 holes the first day, then 13 more the second, and 8 on the third. That's 31 holes total, but they filled in 2, so there were 29 holes left. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first, so there must have been 7 holes at the end of the first day. That means they dug 22 holes on the fourth day!

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Amora and Lainey each got 70 chips, and Collins got 15 more than them, that means Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 chips.  To find the total, we add up what everyone got: 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 chips.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the supplies cost $400 and the tickets cost 50% more, that means the tickets cost an extra $200 (because 50% of $400 is $200).  So, the total cost of travel is $400 + $200 = $600.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  

We know they caught a total of 339 Pokemon. Let's use some detective work:

*  Stan has 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught. That's a good starting point.

* Alex caught 5 more than Stan.

Hmm, let me see... if we figure out how many Stan caught, we can work our way back to Adelwolfe and then Alex.

* Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon.

* Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon.

* Alex caught (4A - 13) + 5 Pokemon.

Now, let's add them all up and see if we can solve for 'A':

A + (4A - 13) + ((4A - 13) + 5) = 339

Simplify that...

9A - 21 = 339

9A = 360

A = 40

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, back to Stan:

Stan caught 4(40) - 13 = 147 Pokemon.



**Answer:** 147 

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as minutes in an episode, meaning there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.  Since each episode is 20 minutes, watching them all would take 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 miles. Then it flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, which is 2 * 18 = 36 miles. Finally, it flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, covering 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between the homes, we add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.

And finally, 4 hybrid racquets at 18 minutes each, that's 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.

Adding it all up: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So John buys two phones at full price, which is 2 * $600 = $1200. The other two phones are half price, so they cost $600 / 2 = $300 each. That means those two cost 2 * $300 = $600.

Adding it all up, John spends $1200 + $600 = $1800 on phones.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Sunny sold 10 gingerbread on Saturday and 4 less apple pies, so that's 6 apple pies. On Sunday, he sold 15 gingerbread (5 more than Saturday) and 15 apple pies.

* **Saturday:**
    * Gingerbread: 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
    * Apple pie: 6 boxes * $15/box = $90
    * Total: $60 + $90 = $150

* **Sunday:**
    * Gingerbread: 15 boxes * $6/box = $90

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Emil's dad will be twice Emil's age when Emil is 24, meaning the dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.  Since Emil is currently 19, his dad is 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Emil will be twice his brother's age when he's 24, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.  Since Emil is currently 19, his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Adding their ages together, we get 43 + 7 = 50.

1332 inches divided by 30 inches per plant means she can fit about 44 plants. But she already has 17, so she needs to buy 27 more.

Those plants cost $6 each, so 27 plants times $6 is... $162.

"Alright, let's break this down.  The second plane does 44 trips a day, and that's only half of what the first plane does. So the first plane is making 44 * 2 = 88 trips.

Now, that first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of those trips, which is 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights. That leaves 88 - 66 = 22 flights for France and Germany.

Since those are split evenly, the first plane takes 22 / 2 = 11 flights to France each day.

We know Helene is twice the average age of the group, and the total age of all four kids is 20.  Akbar is 3 and Alessandro is 4, so let's add those up: 3 + 4 = 7.

That means Helene and Wilfred's ages combined must equal 20 - 7 = 13. Since Helene is twice the average age (and the average age is 20 / 4 = 5), Helene is 5 * 2 = 10 years old.

"Hey there!  Let's figure out how much it'll cost the Smiths to fill their pool.

First, we gotta find the pool's volume: 14 feet wide times 25 feet long times 4 feet deep equals 1400 cubic feet.

Then, we multiply that by 5.9 gallons per cubic foot to see how many gallons they need: 1400 cubic feet times 5.9 gallons per cubic foot equals 8260 gallons.

Finally, we multiply the gallons by the price per gallon, which is $0.10: 8260 gallons times $0.10 per gallon equals $826.00.

So, it'll cost the Smiths $826.00 to fill their pool.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Half of the 3000 students are over 16, so that's 1500 students. A quarter of those are guys, meaning 375 are dudes over 16. That leaves 1125 girls over 16.

The other half of the school, 1500 students, are under 16. Half of them are guys, so 750 are dudes under 16. That means 750 girls are under 16.

Adding those together, we get 1125 + 750 = 1875 girls in the whole school.

"Alright, let's figure this out. Wanda and Ms. B are working hard to fill that tank!

On the first day, Wanda pumps in a quarter of the tank, which is 18000 gallons / 4 = 4500 gallons. Ms. B pumps in three-quarters of what Wanda does, so that's 4500 gallons * 0.75 = 3375 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumps in two-thirds of her day one amount, which is 4500 gallons * (2/3) = 3000 gallons. Ms. B only pumps in a third of her day one amount, so that's 3375 gallons * (1/3) = 1125 gallons.

Let's add up all the water they pumped: 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons + 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

Finally, to find out how much is left, we subtract the total pumped from the tank's capacity: 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.



So the answer is 6000.

"Hey there! This is a tricky one, but let me break it down.

Think of it like this: the power bank lost a chunk of charge just sitting there, then another chunk while charging her friends' phones.  We know what's left at the end, so we gotta work backwards.

It lost 45% in the first 5 hours, then another 21% in the next 3. That's a total of 66% gone!

So, before all that, it must have had 100% - 66% = 34% left.

But remember, her friends used some of that 34%.  They used 34% - 28% = 6% of the power bank's total capacity.

That 6% represents what was left *after* the initial losses.  So, if 6% is what's left of the 34%, the original charge must have been bigger.

Let's see... 6% is about 1/6th of 34%.  So, the original charge was probably around 1/6th * 100% = 16.67% (approximately).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Janet makes $25 an hour ($10 wages + $15 tips) and wants to save 20% of $10,000, which is $2,000. Since she earns $1,000 per week, she'll need to work for 2 weeks to save enough for the down payment.

"Hey there! Let's see... Jamaar's got $10 and has already spent some on peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples.  

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

That's a total of $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25 spent.

He has $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75 left.

Since plums cost $0.25 each, he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Anne had 15 packs of sweets with 60 in each, so that's 15 * 60 = 900 sweets total. She kept 2 packs for herself, leaving 13 packs for her friends. That's 13 * 60 = 780 sweets to share.  With 10 friends, each one gets 780 / 10 = 78 sweets.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If the price goes up 5% each year, here's how it would look:

* **Year 1:** $120 + (0.05 * $120) = $126
* **Year 2:** $126 + (0.05 * $126) = $132.30
* **Year 3:** $132.30 + (0.05 * $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost about $139 after three years. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Olivia put 72 pictures into 8 albums, that means each album has 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  She has 3 albums of selfies, so that's 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.  Her 2 portrait albums have 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.  In total, she has 27 + 18 = 45 portraits and selfies.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

There are 24 easy questions, and Aries gets 75% of those right, so that's 18 easy questions.

The other 36 questions are split evenly between average and difficult, meaning there are 18 of each. She gets half of those right, so that's 9 average and 9 difficult questions correct.

Adding those up, Aries is sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Teresa makes a sweet profit selling those cuddly critters!  Since she sells the big ones for three times the price of the small ones, and she sold twice as many small ones, we can figure this out.

We know she made $120 total, and each small one costs $4. Let's think about it:

* If she sold 'x' big ones, she sold 2x small ones.
* Big ones cost $12 each (3 * $4).
* So, she made 12x dollars from the big ones and 8x dollars from the small ones.

That means 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining those, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.

Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Alright, let's see here...  A dwarf with just his hands can mine 12 pounds a day. With an iron pickaxe, that jumps to 24 pounds. A steel pickaxe is even better, giving them 50% more than the iron pickaxe, so that's 24 * 1.50 = 36 pounds a day.

Now, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds a day, so in a month of 30 days, that's 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds.

With 40 dwarves, we multiply that by 40, giving us a grand total of 1080 * 40 = 43200 pounds of ore.

"Alright, let's break this down. Sally starts with a bunch of balloons: 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow.  Then, whoosh! The wind takes out 40% of the red ones. That's 10 red balloons gone (25 x 0.40 = 10).  

She's left with 15 red balloons. Then, she loses half her yellow balloons, which is 6 (12 / 2 = 6). Now she's down to 6 yellow balloons.

On her way, she finds 8 blue balloons stuck in a tree and grabs 6 of them (8 x 0.75 = 6).

Finally, she walks into school with 15 red + 6 yellow + 6 blue = 27 balloons.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  There's a 50/50 shot Marcus gets a sub, and if that happens, no homework. If his regular teacher shows up, there's a 40% chance everyone gets more time. Even if they don't, Marcus has a 20% chance of pulling the ""dog ate it"" card.

So, to get the chance he *actually* has to turn it in, we gotta look at the times he *doesn't* get out of it. That's the regular teacher, no extension, and no dog excuse. That's a 50% chance of the regular teacher *times* a 60% chance of no extension *times* an 80% chance he can't pull a fast one.

That comes out to 24%.

"Hey there! Let's break this down. Melissa works 6 hours a day for 3 days, so that's 6 * 3 = 18 hours total. She earns $15 per day, so over three days she makes $15 * 3 = $45.  But don't forget parking! That's $3 per day, so for three days it's $3 * 3 = $9.  

So, her total earnings after parking are $45 - $9 = $36.  To find her hourly rate, we divide her net earnings by the total hours: $36 / 18 hours = $2 per hour.

Wednesday they delivered 5 more than twice the amount from Tuesday, meaning 102 * 2 = 204 letters, plus 5 more, for a total of 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Adding up all three days: 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.

"Hey there!  Let me see... they split $1920, the second person got $80 more than the first, and the third got double the second person's share.  

To figure out the first person's cut, let's think of it like this:

*  First person:  x
*  Second person: x + $80
*  Third person: 2 * (x + $80) = 2x + $160

Adding those all up, we get x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

That simplifies to 4x + $240 = $1920

Subtract $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680

Finally, divide both sides by 4: x = $420

So the first person got $420.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

If Rory got half as many balls in the third set compared to the second, and he got a total of 19, we know the second set must have been a decent amount. Let's call the number of balls in the second set ""x"".

* Second set: x balls
* First set: x + 4 balls
* Third set: x / 2 balls

Adding those up, we get x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19

Let's solve for x:

2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

So, the second set had 6 balls. That means the first set had 6 + 4 = 10 balls.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Betsy took longer than Donovan, and their times add up to 98 minutes, we gotta do some subtracting.  

Let's say Donovan took 'x' minutes. Betsy took 'x + 18' minutes.  So, x + (x + 18) = 98.

That means 2x + 18 = 98.  

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Donovan took 40 minutes, and Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Kayla's party will cost.

First, we need to know how many people are coming. She invited 25 classmates + 7 dance friends + 13 family members = 45 people.  But, 4 people can't make it, so that leaves 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

Since the theater costs $125 for the first 20 people, and Kayla has 41 coming, she'll need to pay for 41 - 20 = 21 extra guests.

That's 21 guests * $6/guest = $126 for the extra folks.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800.  That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Jenny bought 10 bunches of bananas with 4 bananas per bunch, that's 40 bananas total.

Buying them individually would cost 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

But she got them in bunches for 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

That means she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, think of it like splitting the fence into three parts: Sam's share, Harry's extra 60 feet, and then the rest for Sam.  Since they have 100 feet total, and Harry's extra 60 feet is one of those parts, that leaves 40 feet for Sam's initial share.

"Hey there!  

This is a classic rate problem.  If the croc grows 8 inches in 4 years, that means it grows 2 inches each year (8 / 4 = 2).  Over 13 years, it'd grow a total of 26 inches (2 x 13 = 26).

"Hey there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings.

First, we know he sold 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each, so that's 150 * $450 = $67,500.

Then, he sold 45 BMX bikes at half the price of an MTB, which is $500 / 2 = $250 each. That brings in 45 * $250 = $11,250.

Finally, he sold 105 MTB bikes at $500 each, totaling 105 * $500 = $52,500.

Adding all those up, Marcel earned a total of $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250 from selling bikes that month. 


$131,250
"
"Hey there! Let me see... the farmer makes 5 bales an hour for 6 hours, so that's 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck takes away 3 bales an hour for 6 hours, so it takes 3 * 6 = 18 bales.  That means there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales left in the field.

"Hey there! Let's break this down.

John's got a busy schedule!  He's taking 8 classes a day, which is 320 minutes of class time.  Over a whole week, that's 1600 minutes.

Then he adds another 100 minutes each day on the weekend for extra studying, so that's another 200 minutes.

Adding it all up, he spends 1800 minutes learning each week.  That's 30 hours!

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  The Allosaurus ate the leftovers, which was 270 kg, and that was only half of what the velociraptors left. So, before those sneaky raptors got to it, there was 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg. But remember, that was only half of what the T-Rex left behind!  That means the triceratops started with 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

Two walls are 10 by 8, so that's 160 square feet (10 * 8 * 2). The other two walls are 5 by 8, which is 80 square feet (5 * 8 * 2).  Add those together and you get 240 square feet total.

Each gallon covers 20 square feet, so he'll need 12 gallons (240 / 20). At $12 a gallon, that's gonna cost him $144.

"Alright, let's break this down. Billy's a real go-getter, helping folks with their taxes!

* First, figure out how many days he's working. March has 31 days, plus 19 in April, that's 50 days total. He takes 20% of those days off, so that's 50 * 0.20 = 10 days off.

* That leaves him with 50 - 10 = 40 days of tax-helping action.

* He helps 2 people per hour, and works 3 hours a day, so that's 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.

* Over 40 days, he helps a whopping 40 * 6 = 240 people!

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. The big slide is 300 feet long and you zoom down at 60 feet per minute. That means it takes 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.

The second slide is shorter at 240 feet, but faster at 80 feet per minute. So that one takes 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.

The difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes. 

It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. Bobby's lunch and breaks each day add up to 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes. Over five days, that's 60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, that's equal to 300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Sheila's credit card balance.

First, she returns that $15 item, so her balance goes down to $85 - $15 = $70.

Then she gets that frying pan deal! 20% off $20 is $4, so the pan costs $16.

The towels are 10% off, which is $3 off of $30, making them $27.

Adding those new purchases to her balance, we get $70 + $16 + $27 = $113.


So her new balance is $113.00. 

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  If 6 jellyfish change color, and that's only a third of the big jellyfish, then there must be 6 * 3 = 18 big jellyfish.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Lauren wants to live on 40% of her $100,000 salary during retirement, which is $40,000 per year.  She's aiming for 20 years of retirement, so she'll need a total of $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 saved up.

Since she saves 20% of her salary each year, that's $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 saved annually. To reach her goal, she'll need to save for $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Soledad wants to hike a whopping 9,300 miles in June. If she hikes 125 miles twice a day, that's 250 miles per day. Over 30 days, that's 7,500 miles (250 miles/day * 30 days).  

She needs to hike 1,800 more miles (9,300 miles - 7,500 miles). To do that in 30 days, she needs to add 60 miles to her daily hikes (1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, they've got 3 red balls at $9 each, that's 3 * $9 = $27.

Then there are 11 blue balls at $5 each, so that's 11 * $5 = $55.

Finally, 25 green balls at $3 each brings in 25 * $3 = $75.

Add it all up: $27 + $55 + $75 = $157.

The store will have made $157 after selling all the balls.

"Hey there! Let's crack this egg-painting mystery.

Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, and together they painted 30.  That means Sarah painted 9 eggs (30 - 12 = 18, then 18 / 2 = 9). Camden painted 21 (9 + 12).

Arnold and Madeline painted the same amount, and together they painted 26 eggs (56 total eggs - 30 = 26). So, Arnold painted 13 eggs (26 / 2 = 13).

Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold (21 - 13 = 8).

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Nik's got 200 crayons, and each box holds 8. That means he'll need 25 boxes (200 / 8 = 25).

Since each crayon weighs an ounce, all those crayons weigh 200 ounces. The boxes themselves weigh 200 ounces too (25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces).

Adding those together, the total weight is 400 ounces.  

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, that's 25 pounds of crayons and boxes (400 / 16 = 25).

"Alright, let's break this down.  That tree's gonna make John some cash!

First, he can only use 80% of the 80-foot tree, so that's 64 feet of wood.

He cuts that into 4-foot logs, so he gets 16 logs.

Each log gives him 5 planks, meaning he's got 80 planks in total.

Selling each plank for $1.20, he'll make a cool $96.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

Valerie makes $5000 a month, which is half of what her brother makes. So her brother earns $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Together, they make $5000 + $10000 = $15000. Their mom makes double that, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000.

Adding it all up, they have a total of $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000 each month.


45000 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Grandma's got a nice routine going!

She spends 40 minutes on the beach, covering 2 miles. That means she's walking at 3 miles per hour on the sand.  On the sidewalk, she doubles that speed, so she's cruising at 6 miles per hour. Since the sidewalk part is only 1 mile, it takes her 10 minutes to finish that stretch.

Adding up the beach time and sidewalk time, Grandma's total walk takes her 50 minutes. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Jane's saved $4 a week for 8 weeks, so that's $4 * 8 = $32.  She wants to reach $60, so she needs $60 - $32 = $28 more.  To get that extra $28, it'll take her $28 / $4 = 7 more weeks.

"Alright, let's break this down. Donny's picky about his water temperature, huh?  

We know the mix has to be at least 40 degrees. That 33-degree water is dragging the temperature down, so the other mug has to be pretty warm to make up for it.

Think of it like this: the colder water adds ""coldness,"" and the hotter water adds ""hotness."" We need enough ""hotness"" to get the whole mix up to 40 degrees.

Since we're only adding a little bit from the hotter mug, it's gotta be pretty darn hot to make a difference. I'd say the second bottle has to be at least 68 degrees. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 more cows each day for three weeks, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens each day for three weeks.

* That's 20 cows/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 420 cows from Milkie Cows Limited.
* And 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week * 3 weeks = 210 chickens from Broilers Limited.

Adding those to his starting animals, he'll have 50 + 420 = 470 cows and 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

In total, that's 470 + 230 = 700 animals on the farm!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, Russell gets 9 bagels per pack, and he's buying 4 packs, which means he's got 9 * 4 = 36 bagels in total.

Those 4 packs would normally cost him 4 * $10.00 = $40.00, but he gets a sweet 10% discount, saving him $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00.

That brings his total down to $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

To find the price per bagel, we divide the total cost by the number of bagels: $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so that's 18 scoops.

It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes, which is 3 potatoes, to make 1 less than 3 scoops, which is 2 scoops.

So, each scoop needs 3 potatoes divided by 2 scoops, which equals 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Gomer ate 18 scoops times 1.5 potatoes per scoop, totaling 27 potatoes.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Chester eats a lot of eggs!  

He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.

Then he ups it to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, which is 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 eggs over 60 days.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he'll need 240 / 12 = 20 dozen eggs.

"
"Hey there! Let's crack this jelly bean mystery.  

We know there are 17 green jelly beans and twice that many red ones, so that's 17 * 2 = 34 red jelly beans. That means there are 17 + 34 = 51 green and red jelly beans altogether.

Since there are 60 jelly beans total, the rest must be blue! That's 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans.

"Alright, let's break this down.  The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women. That's a total of 14 parts.

If there are 84 passengers total, that means each ""part"" of the ratio represents 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

So, there were initially 9 parts * 6 passengers/part = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 women - 20 women = 34 women left.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and bouquets for $8. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet. That means he makes $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower each day.

Over three days, he makes $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.  He earned a total of $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over three days.

So, he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.67 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, Faraday sold 30 sunflowers after 3 days.

"Alright, let's break this down. Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is 2 feet shorter than that, making him 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so he's 6 feet tall. Since Carl's cane is half his height, it's 3 feet long.

"Hey there! Let me see... Hortex makes 4200 bottles a day, and each bottle covers 20% of a person's energy needs.  So, they're covering 4200 * 0.20 = 840% of a person's daily energy needs.

To cover 100% for 2300 people, they'd need to cover 2300 * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy needs.

That means they need to make up 230,000% - 840% = 229,160% more.

Since each bottle covers 20%, they'd need to produce 229,160% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Abraham made.

He started with 80 square meters and sold half for $50, so that's 40 square meters gone. Then he sold another 1/4 of what was left (which was 40 square meters), so that's another 10 square meters sold for $30.

That leaves him with 30 square meters. He sells those for $3 each, so that's 30 * $3 = $90.

Adding up all his sales, he made $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

"Hey there! Let's crack this egg hunt mystery. Cole hid a whole lotta eggs – 3 dozen, which is 36! Lamar snagged 5, Stacy found double that, so she got 10. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, meaning he got 8. And Mei, she found half of what Charlie did, so that's 4.  

Altogether, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.

That means there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs still hiding out there!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, John's got a lot of garbage to collect!  

* The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.
* The third complex is 60% bigger than those two combined, so it's 400 * 0.60 = 240 apartments bigger.
* That means the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.
* In total, he's collecting from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.
* He hits each place three times a week, so that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.
* At $0.40 per collection, he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 a week.

Not bad for a garbage man!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the avocado tree's fruit production goes like this:

* Year 5: 50 fruits
* Year 6: 50 * 3 = 150 fruits
* Year 7: 50 * 7 = 350 fruits
* Year 8:  We know a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 less than that, so 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
* Year 9: 0 fruits
* Year 10: 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits

Adding all those up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 + 0 = 2350 fruits

"Hey there! Let's break this problem down.

We know the red rope is four times longer than the blue rope.  The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  And all three ropes together are 37 centimeters long.

To figure out the red rope's length, we gotta do some detective work. Think of it like a puzzle!

Let's say the blue rope is 'b' centimeters long. That means the red rope is 4 times that, or 4b centimeters long. The yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than the blue rope, so it's b + 7 centimeters long.

Now, if we add up the lengths of all three ropes, we get:

b + 4b + (b + 7) = 37

Combining like terms, we have:

6b + 7 = 37

Subtracting 7 from both sides:

6b = 30

Dividing both sides by 6:

b = 5

So the blue rope is 5 centimeters long.  

Since the red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

"Let's break this down. Rissa had three times the amount Ronnie had, so she started with $5 * 3 = $15.  

After giving some money to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left. That means she gave away 1/5 of $15, which is $3.

Ronnie also gave $3 to their sister. Since he started with $5, he has $5 - $3 = $2 left.

"Hey there!  Let's break this down.  Half the mural is yellow, so that's 12 pints / 2 = 6 pints of yellow.  That leaves 12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints for the red, white, and purple. Since they're used equally, each of those colors takes up 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so that's 20 * 12 = 240 square feet per bedroom.  Since there are four bedrooms, that's 240 * 4 = 960 square feet total for the bedrooms.

The living room is five times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

Finally, adding the rest of the house, the total area is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

"Hey there! This sounds like a fun problem. Let's see...

Alice starts with 3 clouds on Monday. Then she sees double that on Tuesday, so that's 6. Wednesday is double Tuesday, so that's 12. Thursday is double Wednesday, making it 24. And finally, Friday is double Thursday, giving us 48 clouds.

"Hey there!  Let me break this down for ya.  

That special box has 20% more pods, so that's an extra 20 pods on top of the usual 100. That brings the total to 120 pods.

"Alright, let's break this down. Team A had a great first half with 4 goals! Team B was a bit behind with 2 fewer, so they scored 2 goals.  In the second half, Team B really stepped it up, scoring 4 times their first half amount, which is 8 goals! Team A only managed half of that, scoring 2 goals.

Adding it all up, Team A scored 6 goals total (4 + 2) and Team B scored 10 goals (2 + 8). That means there were a total of 16 goals in the match!

"
"Alright, let's break this down.  

Let's say Wendy is ""w"" years old and Colin is ""c"" years old.

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years: w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

Now we can solve for ""c"", Colin's current age.

First, let's solve the first equation for ""w"":

w = 5c + 35

Now, plug that value of ""w"" into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Simplify and solve for ""c"":

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

So, Colin is 20 years old.

"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.

If Bob spends $500 for every 100 books, that means each book costs $5.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 bottles.  That means he spends 20 * $90 = $1800 on cognac. In total, he spends $600 + $1800 = $2400.

Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day and twice that many Lodgepole Pine, so he planted 20 * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees. That's a total of 20 + 40 = 60 trees on the first day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, bringing his total to 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine than the first day, which is 40 * (1/4) = 10 more Lodgepole Pine.  So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

If Mattison and the first floor together are 60 inches + 180 inches = 240 inches, then the second floor is 420 inches - 240 inches = 180 inches high.

"Alright, let's break this down.  

First, we gotta figure out how many jelly beans this jar can hold. It's a square, so the base is 6 inches by 6 inches, and it's 15 inches tall. That means it's got a volume of 6 times 6 times 15, which is 540 cubic inches.

But jelly beans don't fit together perfectly, right? They're gonna leave some air gaps.  He said they get about 80% packing efficiency, so we multiply that 540 cubic inches by 0.80, giving us 432 cubic inches of actual jelly bean space.

Each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, so we divide 432 by 0.15 to get 2880 jelly beans total.

Now, he thinks 30% of those are red, so we multiply 2880 by 0.30, which gives us 864 red jelly beans.

Now, add everyone up: the original 20, plus the 40 from the first stop, and the 30 from the second stop. That's 20 + 40 + 30 = 90 people.

At the third stop, the number of passengers doubles, so now there are 90 * 2 = 180 people on the bus.

Finally, subtract that from the bus's total capacity to see how many more people can fit: 200 - 180 = 20 people.

The longer piece is four parts, so it's 4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet long.

"Alright, let's figure this out.  Aiden needs 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs per pound of beef. That means he'll need 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.

He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of beef, so he'll need 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons per pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out.  

If Luke has five windows at 35 inches each, that's 5 * 35 = 175 inches total. Since he needs twice that amount of fabric, he should buy 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric. 


350 

"
"Hey there!  Let me break that down for ya.  

The first 16 minutes cost $4.00 (16 x $0.25). The rest of the call, 20 minutes, costs $4.00 (20 x $0.20).  

So, a 36-minute call would set you back $8.00. 


$8.00
"
"Hey there! Let me see... twice the rain from Monday would be 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.  And then one more inch on top of that is 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

So the answer is 5. 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Carly needs enough treats for everyone in her class to have two each, so that's 5 people * 2 treats/person = 10 treats total.  She makes fewer cupcakes than brownies, and the brownies are based on how many cupcakes she makes.  

To figure out how many cupcakes she made, we gotta think backwards. Let's say she made 'x' cupcakes. She makes three times that many brownies minus two, so that's 3x - 2 brownies.

Adding the cupcakes and brownies together, we get x + (3x - 2) = 10. Combining like terms, we have 4x - 2 = 10.  Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4x = 12. Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find x = 3.

So Carly made 3 cupcakes. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Karen's total cost. 

A mani-pedi combo usually costs $35 + $40 = $75.  But since she's getting both, she gets a 20% discount, which is $75 * 0.20 = $15 off. So the combo is now $75 - $15 = $60.

Adding nail art to all 10 fingers will cost $3/nail * 10 nails = $30.

In total, Karen will pay $60 + $30 = $90.


$90
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Susan gets a lot of magazines! Those three magazines sending 12 issues each add up to 36 issues (3 x 12 = 36). Then she gets 6 more from another one. And that last magazine? That's a whopping 24 issues (6 x 4 = 24)!

Adding them all up, she gets 66 magazines a year (36 + 6 + 24 = 66). 


66
"
"Alright, let's break this down. Samantha has 27 paintings, and that's 12 fewer than Shelley. So Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Now, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, meaning Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings. 

31 

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.

The toy started at $40. In December, the price jumped up by 80%, which is like adding $40 * 0.80 = $32 to the original price. So in December, it cost $40 + $32 = $72.

Then in January, the price dropped by 50%, meaning it went down by $72 * 0.50 = $36.  That brings the January price to $72 - $36 = $36.

So the final price in January was $36. 



"
"Alright, let's break this down. Charlie makes $80 an hour normally, but gives a 25% discount to veterans, so that's $80 * 0.25 = $20 off.  That means he charges veterans $80 - $20 = $60 an hour.

He's got 4 regular lessons at $80 each, so that's 4 * $80 = $320.

Then he's got 2 lessons with veterans at $60 each, so that's 2 * $60 = $120.

Adding those together, he makes $320 + $120 = $440 for the day.


$440 

"
"Hey there! To find Sally's mean score, we gotta add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the total number of quizzes.  

Let's see... 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630.

Now, divide that by 9 quizzes: 630 / 9 = 70.

So Sally's mean score is 70. 



"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If Eve had 20 pomelos and now has 1/4 of that amount left, she gave away 3/4 of her pomelos.  That means she gave away 20 * (3/4) = 15 pomelos.


15 

"
"Hey there! Let me break this down for you.

First, Walter munched on 2/5 * 60 = 24 apples. That leaves him with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

Then, he gives his sister 25% of those, which is (25/100) * 36 = 9 apples.

That means he has 36 - 9 = 27 apples left.

Finally, he sells those for $3 each, earning him 27 * $3 = $81.


$81
"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. If 9 novels is three-quarters of the total she wrote this year, we can think of it like this: 9 novels is 3 out of 4 equal parts. To find the whole (all 4 parts), we divide the known part (9 novels) by 3: 9 / 3 = 3. Then, we multiply that by 4 to get the total: 3 * 4 = 12.

So Regina wrote 12 novels this year. 


12
"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Michael's driving 50 km per hour for 3 whole days, which is 72 hours total. That means he covers 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km.

Now, if the trip from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km, he's covered 3600 km / 6000 km * 100% = 60% of the distance.

"
"Let's see... Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used 5 times that amount, which is 6 * 5 = 30 grapes.  That's a total of 6 + 30 = 36 grapes gone already.  

Their mom used 48 grapes for pies because she needed 12 grapes per pie and made 4 pies.

So, they started with 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.


84 

"
"Hey there!  Let's see... 82 teachers minus 13 sick teachers equals 69 teachers. Then you add the 9 substitute teachers, so that's 69 plus 9, which is 78 teachers at school.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Bud's macaroni and cheese habit sounds delicious.

So, he spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar, and $6.00 on gruyere (since that's twice the cheddar). That's a total of $10.00 per week.

Over a whole year, with 52 weeks, that adds up to $520.00. 


520.00 

"
"Hey there! Let me see... 80 classrooms at 15 minutes each is 1200 minutes of cleaning.  That's a full 20 hours of cleaning!  Since they work 8 hour days, that means cleaning takes up half their time.

So the answer is 50%. 



"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and the bottom shelf holds double that, so 20 books. The top shelf holds 5 less than the bottom, meaning it holds 15 books. That's a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

Since Elly has 110 books, she'll need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure out Rose's profit. 

She spent $2.40 per dozen on five dozens, so that's 5 * $2.40 = $12.00 total.

She's got 60 eggs (5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen) and can sell them in sets of 3 for $1.00 each. That means she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sets.

Selling all the sets will earn her 20 * $1.00 = $20.00.

Her profit is her earnings minus her costs: $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00.


$8.00 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Skyler's got a lot of hats! Half of his 100 hats are red, so that's 50 red hats. That leaves 50 hats left.  Three-fifths of those are blue, which is 30 blue hats.  That means the rest, 20 hats, must be white.


20 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If the jerky is $3 off, that means Archie pays $15 for the bag.  Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, each stick costs 50 cents. 


50
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right, which means she needs to answer 77 questions correctly (110 total questions * 0.70 = 77).

She already got 42 questions right on the first test (70 questions * 0.60 = 42).  That means she needs to get 35 questions right on the second test (77 - 42 = 35).

So the answer is 35. 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  If Mary makes 's' strawberry cubes, she makes 5s - 4 blueberry cubes.  Since she makes 116 total, we know s + (5s - 4) = 116.  Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116.  Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6s = 120, and dividing by 6 gives us s = 20 strawberry cubes.  

That means she makes 5(20) - 4 = 96 blueberry cubes.


96 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ara plays 40 games a year and scores 21 points each game. Over four years, that's 4 years * 40 games/year = 160 games.

3360
"
"Let's break it down:

Brendan starts with 10 marbles, drops half (5), and finds 3. That means he lost 2 marbles (5 - 3 = 2).  He then finds he has a bead mixed in, so he gets rid of that.

That leaves him with 4 marbles.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Jason needs to sell 15 cars, and he knows that for every 25 calls he makes, one person comes to the dealership.  Then, for every two people who visit, one buys a car.  

So, he needs 15 customers to buy cars, which means he needs 30 people to visit the dealership (15 customers * 2 people per customer = 30 visits). To get 30 visits, he'll need to make 750 phone calls (30 visits * 25 calls per visit = 750 calls).

750 

"
"Hey there! Let's see... they've got 4 people and each person gets a flashlight, so that's 4 flashlights right off the bat.  Then there are 8 rooms, and each room gets 2 flashlights, so that's another 16 flashlights.  

Now for the candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 rooms times 4 candles, which is 16 candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's another 4 rooms times 5 candles, which is 20 candles.

Adding all those up, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.  

Finally, add the candles and flashlights together: 36 + 4 = 40.

So the answer is 40! 



"
"Hey there! Let's see... two bags with 55 chips each is 110 chips total.  Since there are five people, each person gets 22 chips.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So, the first side takes 5 minutes. The second and third sides each take twice that, so that's 10 minutes each. The last two sides take half the time of the first, which is 2.5 minutes each.

Adding it all up: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.

It takes 30 minutes to solve the whole cube! 



"
"Hey there! Let's break this down. If there were 20 helmets, and there were half as many robots, that means there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  There were also twice as many footballs as helmets, so there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs.

Adding them all up, Dominick saw 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items. 


70 

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Tim works 6 hours a day, which is 360 minutes. If each call takes 15 minutes, he can handle 360 / 15 = 24 calls per day. Over a 5 day work week, that's 24 calls/day * 5 days/week = 120 calls.

"
"Hey there! Let me see... the old varnish took 7 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, that's 7 * 6 = 42 minutes.  The new varnish takes 12 minutes per painting, so for 6 paintings, it's 12 * 6 = 72 minutes.  That means the new varnish takes 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Crista has 20 plants.  Four of them need half a cup of water, which is 2 cups total. Eight plants need a full cup each, so that's 8 cups. The rest, which is 8 plants, need a quarter cup each, making it another 2 cups.

Adding it all up, Crista needs 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts a day, which is 120 doughnuts (10 x 12 = 120).  He sells each one for $2, so he makes $240 every day (120 x 2 = 240).  Since June has 30 days, he'd make $7200 that month (240 x 30 = 7200).


7200 

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Jade uploads 7 photos per batch and does 6 batches a day, so that's 7 * 6 = 42 photos a day.  To upload all 210 photos, it'll take her 210 / 42 = 5 days.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Alicia spends $5.00 per blouse, and she has 5 blouses, so that's $5.00 * 5 = $25.00. Her pants cost $8.00 each, and she has 2 pairs, so that's $8.00 * 2 = $16.00.  The skirt is $6.00.

In total, her weekly dry cleaning bill is $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00.

Over 5 weeks, that's $47.00 * 5 = $235.00.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

Conor saw 50 people on the first day, then 50 + 20 = 70 people on the second day. On the third day, there were 70 * 2 = 140 people. For the rest of the week, he saw 60 people each day for 4 days, so that's 60 * 4 = 240 people.

Adding it all up: 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500 people.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  

So, Garrett starts with 20 kernels popping in the first 30 seconds. Then, BAM, three times that many pop in the next 30 seconds, which is 60 kernels.  The next 30 seconds are even crazier, with four times the original amount, so that's 80 kernels.  

Things slow down a bit in the last 30 seconds, with half the rate of the previous 30, meaning 40 kernels pop. But wait, there's more! Even after he takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of those last 30 seconds' pops happen, so that's another 10 kernels.

Adding it all up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn for Garrett to munch on!

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  Tim needs 4 gallons of regular lemonade, and each gallon takes 1 cup of lemon juice. Since 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice, he'll need 24 lemons for that (4 gallons * 6 lemons/gallon = 24 lemons).

Now, Allen wants an extra gallon that's twice as tart. That means it needs twice the lemon juice, or 2 cups. So, he'll need 12 lemons for that (2 cups * 6 lemons/cup = 12 lemons).

In total, Tim needs 36 lemons (24 lemons + 12 lemons = 36 lemons).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Those German Shepherds are big eaters!  They gobble up 15 kilograms of food a day (3 dogs x 5 kg/dog). The Bulldogs aren't as hungry, only needing 6 kilograms total (2 dogs x 3 kg/dog). That means they need 21 kilograms every single day (15 kg + 6 kg).

Over a whole week, that adds up to a whopping 147 kilograms (21 kg/day * 7 days/week).

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Elvis drove west for 5 hours at 18 mph, covering 90 miles (5 * 18 = 90). Then he drove east for 8 hours at the same speed, covering 144 miles (8 * 18 = 144). Since he drove further east than west, we subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance: 144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.

"Hey there! Let's crack this candy conundrum.  

We know there are 232 candies total.  There are 54 red ones, twice that many orange (so 108), and half as many yellow as red (so 27). That's 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies accounted for.

That means there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

So Helen's hotel cost $80 per night, and she stayed for three nights, meaning the hotel cost her $80 * 3 = $240.

Each bus ride was 10% of the hotel cost, which is $80 * 0.10 = $8. Since she took 7 bus rides, that's $8 * 7 = $56.

Adding the hotel and bus costs together, Helen spent $240 + $56 = $296 on her trip.

They make 5000 chocolate bars a day and sell each one for $2. That means they make 5000 * $2 = $10,000 every day.

Over a week, that's $10,000 * 7 = $70,000.

And for two weeks, it's double that: $70,000 * 2 = $140,000.

So the answer is $140,000.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent.

Those T-shirts are a good deal! Since he gets one half off, the second one costs $8 / 2 = $4.  So the shirts cost $8 + $4 = $12 total.

The shoes are 40% off, which is a discount of $40 * 0.40 = $16. That means the shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Ryan earns $6 a week for chores, and he did them for 3 weeks, so that's $6 x 3 = $18.  He spent $1.25 per ice cream cone for himself and his 3 friends, for a total of 4 cones, so that's $1.25 x 4 = $5.  That leaves him with $18 - $5 = $13.  Movie tickets cost $6.50 each, so he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Hey there! Let's figure out how much Ellen and Lani spent. Ellen's leggings cost $100 and the frame was $5, so that's $100 + $5 = $105. Lani spent $30 on sunglasses and $100 each on two bathrobes, which is $100 x 2 = $200.  Adding the bathrobes to the sunglasses, she spent $200 + $30 = $230.  

Finally, to find the total, we add Ellen's spending and Lani's spending: $105 + $230 = $335.

"Alright, let's break down Tim's honey and jam business.

He spends $12 on passion fruit, $12 on jackfruit, and $20 on honey for each jar, totaling $44 in costs. Since he sells each jar for $50, he makes a profit of $6 per jar.

Selling 10 jars would net him a profit of $60.

"Hey there! Let's see... 32 quarters is $8.00, 95 dimes is $9.50, 120 nickels is $6.00, and 750 pennies is $7.50.  Adding those all up, Justin has $31.00 in his jar.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream, $15.00 on movie tickets (since she bought two at $7.50 each), and $8.50 on a bracelet. That's a total of $27.00. If her parents gave her $40.00, she has $13.00 left. 


$13.00
"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out. Josh works 5 days a week and services 3 cars each day, so that's 15 cars a week.  He makes $4 per car, so he earns $60 each week. Over two weeks, he'd make $120. 


$120 

"
"Let's see... Randy starts with 18 cookies. He eats 3, then 2 more, leaving him with 13.  He gives away 2, so he has 11 left. Then he bakes 12 more, for a grand total of 23 cookies!

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Matthew's got 12 toy soldiers. Half of them, that's 6, would sell for $5 each, so that's 6 * $5 = $30. The other 6 would sell for $7 each, so that's 6 * $7 = $42.  Add those together, and Matthew would make $30 + $42 = $72.

"
"Alright, let's figure this out.  The dog digs a ton of holes! 84 holes in total while Nate's gone.  

Nate fills 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 more each night. That means Nate's actually making progress by 3 holes every day (9 - 6 = 3).

So, it'll take him 28 days to fill all those holes (84 holes / 3 holes per day = 28 days).

That's 4 weeks of filling holes!

"Hey there!  

Let's see... Norman High has 4000 students, and Butler High has 3/4 of that, so that's 3000 students.  That means Norman High has 1000 more students than Butler High.

1000

"Hey there! Let's see... they made 7995 cookies total, and 2595 were rainbow and 3075 were oatmeal.  That means they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies! 



"
"Igor, that blundering buffoon! He always messes things up. Let's see... I asked for 16 test tubes, he brought 8.  And 16 Petri dishes instead of 14.  He did get the 7 beakers right, but somehow managed to lose some on the way to the bench.  If he only put out 29 things in total, that means he lost... hmm... 8 items.  But he only brought 8 fewer test tubes than I asked for, so he must have lost all the beakers he *didn't* lose!

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

James needs 2 screws per leg, and each table has 4 legs, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 screws per table.

He's building 4 tables, so he'll need 8 * 4 = 32 screws total.

Since he starts with 40 screws, he'll have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left over.

"Hey there!  Let's see... if one basket has 10 eggs and the other has twice that amount, that means the second basket has 20 eggs.  So, together they have 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.

"
"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  Alexandra raised $430, and Kim raised $320 more than that, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, meaning Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

To find the total, we add up everyone's earnings: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $2180.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, who ran 2 miles in 16 minutes. That means Aaron ran each mile in 8 minutes. Since Vanessa runs each mile in twice the time as Aaron, she takes 16 minutes per mile.  With Vanessa running 4 miles, her total time is 4 miles * 16 minutes/mile = 64 minutes.

"Alright, let me see... 200 feet of dock and he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. That's 200 times 3, which is 600 feet of line in total.  He already has 6 feet, so he needs to buy 594 more feet.

"
"Hey there! Let's break this down.  

Tom's restaurant gets 6 groups of folks in each night, and each group spends $15 (2 meals at $5 each plus a $5 bottle of wine). That means they make $90 each night. Since they're open two nights a week, they rake in $180.

"
"Hey there!  Let me see... he made a 25% profit on 50 watermelons that cost him $80.  That means he made an extra $20 (25% of $80). So, he sold them all for $100.  To find out how much each one cost, we divide $100 by 50, which gives us $2 per watermelon.

"
"Alright, let's break this down. Dora's turning 12 in three years, so she's 9 now.  James is twice her age, making him 18.  John was 19 when James was born, so he's 37 now. His youngest son was born when John was 32, meaning the youngest is 5. In three years, the little guy will be 8.

"
"Hey there!  Let's figure this out. Ana peels oranges faster than Jane, so after an hour, she'll have peeled more.  

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Ana will peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

Jane will peel 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges.

That means Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.

So, the radiator normally costs $400, but he got a sweet deal at the junk shop for 80% off. That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320!

So the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 an hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding it all up, Mark paid $80 + $150 = $230.

"Hey there! This is a classic puzzle. Let me see... 20 animals with 70 legs...  Gotta be some chickens and cows in there.  

Think about it: chickens have two legs, cows have four.  If we had all chickens, we'd only have 40 legs.  Gotta be some cows to make up the difference.

Let me do some figuring...

...

Aha! There are **5** chickens on the farm.

"Hey there!  Let's see... 7 pizzas times 8 slices each is 56 slices total.  Since there are 4 people, they each get 56 divided by 4, which is 14 slices.
