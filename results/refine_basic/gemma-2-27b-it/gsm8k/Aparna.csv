"Hi there! Let's figure out Josh's profit. 

First, we need to find out how much the house is worth after the repairs. Since the repairs increased the value by 150%, that means the value went up by $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000.

So, the house is now worth $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Josh's total investment was $80,000 (for the house) + $50,000 (for repairs) = $130,000.

Finally, his profit is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, for a total of 40 cups. Since each chicken needs 3 cups a day, and she has 20 chickens, she needs a total of 60 cups.  That means she needs to give them 20 more cups in the final meal.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Since every second glass is discounted, Kylar will pay full price for 8 glasses and the discounted price for the other 8.

A discounted glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3. So, 8 glasses at full price cost $40 (8 * $5 = $40) and 8 glasses at the discounted price cost $24 (8 * $3 = $24).

In total, Kylar needs to pay $64 ($40 + $24 = $64).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Carla downloads 40% of the file, which is 80 GB, before the restart. That took her 40 minutes (80 GB / 2 GB/minute).  

After the 20-minute restart, she has 120 GB left to download. That will take another 60 minutes (120 GB / 2 GB/minute).

Adding it all up: 40 minutes + 20 minutes + 60 minutes = 120 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

John drives 180 miles initially (3 hours * 60 mph).  Then, he's stuck for 2 hours, so he doesn't cover any more ground.  

He drives another 15 miles at 30 mph for half an hour. Finally, he zooms for 1.5 hours at 80 mph, covering 120 miles.

That means in those 4 hours, he covers a total of 15 + 120 = 135 miles.

Since he drove 180 miles out and 135 miles back, he's 180 - 135 = 45 miles from home.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Eliza's earnings. 

She earns $10 an hour for her first 40 hours, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours - 40 regular hours). Her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.  So her overtime pay is 5 * $12 = $60.

Adding her regular pay and overtime pay, Eliza earned $400 + $60 = $460 this week.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

The program had 60 downloads the first month. In the second month, it got three times that amount, which is 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.  But then in the third month, downloads went down by 30% from the second month. That's a reduction of 180 * 0.30 = 54 downloads. So, the third month had 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Adding up all three months, we get 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Carlos needs to make back the $90 it costs to plant the tree. He earns $10.50 each year from selling lemons (7 lemons * $1.50/lemon) but spends $3.00 on care. That means he makes a profit of $7.50 per year ($10.50 - $3.00).

To find out how many years it takes to make back the $90, we divide: $90 / $7.50 per year = 12 years.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, and that's after selling some, we need to work backwards. Think of it like this:

* **Before the orange house:** She had 5 + (the amount she sold at the orange house).
* **Before the red house:** She had that amount + 2 (since she sold 2 at the red house).
* **Before the green house:** She had that amount * 3 (since she sold 1/3 at the green house).

Let's say 'x' is the original number of vacuum cleaners.  We can set up an equation:

x = (5 + (x/2 - 1)) * 3 + 2

Solving for x:

x = (5 + x/2 - 1) * 3 + 2
x = (x/2 + 4) * 3 + 2
x = 3x/2 + 12 + 2
x = 3x/2 + 14
x - 3x/2 = 14
x/2 = 14
x = 28



Melanie started with 28 vacuum cleaners. 

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If 20% of the 20 students are in contemporary dance, that's 4 students (20 * 0.20 = 4). That leaves 16 students (20 - 4 = 16).

Then, 25% of those remaining students are in jazz, which is another 4 students (16 * 0.25 = 4).

That means 12 students are left for hip-hop (16 - 4 = 12).

To find the percentage, we divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students and multiply by 100: (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

"Hey there!  

Let's figure this out. If $19.50 is 75% of the original price (because of that 25% discount), we can set up a simple equation: 0.75 * original price = $19.50.

To find the original price, we divide both sides by 0.75:

original price = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, let's see how much Marie spent on the chicken, milk, and apples:

* Chicken: $12
* Milk: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
* Apples: 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6

That's a total of $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Since Marie paid $50 in total, she spent $50 - $33 = $17 on pizza.

If each pizza box costs $8.50, she must have ordered $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes of pizza.

Finally, she bought 3 pairs of shoes at $42 each, which is 3 * $42 = $126.00.

Adding it all up: $49.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $243.00


Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Cynthia eats ice cream every day for 60 days, so that's 60 servings. Each carton has 15 servings, so she'll need 4 cartons (60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons).  Since each carton costs $4.00, her total cost will be $16.00 (4 cartons * $4.00/carton).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Darrell and Allen's ages have a ratio of 7:11, and their combined age is 162.  This means their ages are like 7 parts and 11 parts of a whole.

First, we find the value of one ""part"" by dividing their total age by the total ratio parts: 162 / (7 + 11) = 162 / 18 = 9.

Darrell is 7 parts, so he's 7 * 9 = 63 years old.

Allen is 11 parts, making him 11 * 9 = 99 years old.

In 10 years, Allen will be 99 + 10 = 109 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Gretchen has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can think of it like this:

* **Silver coins:**  Let's say Gretchen has 'x' silver coins.
* **Gold coins:** She would then have 'x + 30' gold coins.

Since she has a total of 110 coins, we can write an equation:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Combining like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 40

So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

To find the number of gold coins, we add 30:

40 + 30 = 70


Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. John earned $15 for each of his 13 Lego sets, so he made 13 * $15 = $195.  He spent $20 on each of the 8 video games, totaling $20 * 8 = $160. Since he had $5 left over, he had $160 + $5 = $165 before buying the games. This means he sold enough Lego sets to make $165, which is $165 / $15 per set = 11 Lego sets.  If he started with 13 and sold 11, he has 13 - 11 = 2 Lego sets left.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down.

Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, and that's half her running speed, so she runs at 6 miles per hour.  Since she runs four times faster than she walks, her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.

She spends 2 hours running (one-third of 6 hours) and 4 hours walking (two-thirds of 6 hours).

In those 2 hours of running, she covers 12 miles (6 miles/hour * 2 hours).

During her 4 hours of walking, she covers 6 miles (1.5 miles/hour * 4 hours).

Adding those distances together, Dana travels a total of 18 miles.

That bonus is $50,000 * 0.05 = $2,500 per year.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many gems are in that treasure chest. 

There are 175 diamonds, and 35 fewer rubies, so there are 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.

There are twice as many emeralds as rubies, meaning there are 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

Adding them all up, there are 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems in the chest!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, there must be 120 boys (60 x 2 = 120). That means there are a total of 180 students (120 + 60 = 180).

Since there are 5 students for every teacher, there must be 36 teachers (180 / 5 = 36).

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Judy makes. 

She teaches 25 classes during the week (5 classes a day for 5 days) and 8 on Saturday, for a total of 33 classes. With 15 students in each class, that's 33 * 15 = 495 students.

Since she charges $15 per student, she earns 495 * $15 = $7425.00 in a week.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find the total cost of the phones: 5 phones * $150/phone = $750.

Then, we calculate the interest for each phone: $150 * 0.02 = $3.

The total interest is $3/phone * 5 phones = $15.

Adding the interest to the original cost, Shiela will pay $750 + $15 = $765 in total.

Finally, her monthly payment will be $765 / 3 months = $255.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Artie makes. 

Since he's rounding to the nearest dollar, here's the breakdown:

* **Marigolds:** 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
* **Petunias:** 9 pots * $2/pot = $18
* **Begonias:** 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Adding those up, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $88 today.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If the top level is 16 square feet and each level is half the size of the one below it, we can work our way down:

* Level 3: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet
* Level 2: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet
* Level 1: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet

Now, to find the average, we add up all the levels: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

Finally, we divide the total by the number of levels: 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Cecilia needs 1 cup of food per day for the first 180 days, so that's 180 cups.  Then she needs 2 cups a day for the rest of the year, which is 365 - 180 = 185 days. That's another 370 cups (2 cups/day * 185 days).

In total, she needs 180 + 370 = 550 cups of food. Since each bag has 110 cups, she'll need 550 / 110 = 5 bags.

"Okay, let's figure this out!

Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, and that's 2 seconds faster than Gerald used to run it. So Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.

Gerald's diet helped him improve by 10%, which is 40 * 0.10 = 4 seconds faster.

That means Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are two cats for every dog and 60 dogs, that means there are 60 * 2 = 120 cats.

That's a lot of cats!  

So, there are 120 cats + 60 dogs = 180 dogs and cats in total.

The problem says there are 12 fewer rabbits than dogs and cats combined, so there are 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Finally, to find the total number of pets, we add up all the animals: 168 rabbits + 180 dogs and cats = 348 pets.

First, we need to find the space inside each box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we subtract 2 inches from each outside measurement (1 inch from each side).

That means each box is 3 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 2 inches tall on the inside.

To find the volume, we multiply those numbers together: 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has three boxes, the total inner volume is 24 cubic inches/box * 3 boxes = 72 cubic inches.

First, we need to figure out how far she rows in total. It takes her 64 seconds to reach shore, and she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. That means she rows 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

Over 64 seconds, she rows 1.25 feet/second * 64 seconds = 80 feet.

Since she takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet, over 80 feet she takes on 80 feet / 10 feet/intake * 2 liters/intake = 16 liters of water.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Sasha's profit. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the 2x4s: 10 boards * $10/board = $100.  Since the price went up 50%, each 2x4 now costs $10 * 1.50 = $15. So, she'll make 10 boards * $15/board = $150 from those.

Now for the 4x4s: 5 boards * $16/board = $80 originally. With the increase, each 4x4 costs $16 * 1.50 = $24. She'll earn 5 boards * $24/board = $120 from those.

In total, she'll make $150 + $120 = $270.  

Since her total cost was $100 + $80 = $180, her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

Think of it like this: the ratio 7:13 represents 20 parts in total (7 + 13 = 20).  Each of those parts is worth 120 / 20 = 6.

Since the sugar part of the ratio is 7, Katy used 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

"Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, and this was 30% higher than Lylah's salary.  To find Lylah's salary, we can set up an equation:

* Let Lylah's salary four years ago be represented by 'x'.
* Adrien's salary four years ago = x + 0.30x = 1.30x
* We know 1.30x = $40,000
* Solving for x: x = $40,000 / 1.30 = $30,769.23 (approximately)

Now, let's figure out their salaries four years later. Adrien's salary increased by 40%:

* Adrien's salary four years later = $40,000 + (0.40 * $40,000) = $56,000

Lylah's salary also increased, but we need to remember her original salary was $30,769.23.

* Lylah's salary four years later = $30,769.23 + (0.30 * $30,769.23) = $40,000

Finally, to find their total combined salary four years later:

* Total salary = Adrien's salary + Lylah's salary = $56,000 + $40,000 = $96,000

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, meaning she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each night.  Since there are 4 more days in the week, that's 7 * 4 = 28 hours.

Adding up all the hours, Sadie slept a total of 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

The subs cost 2 * $7.50 = $15.00.
The chips are 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.
The cookies are 2 * $1.00 = $2.00.

That's a subtotal of $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

The delivery fee is $20.00 * 0.20 = $4.00.

Adding that to the subtotal, we get $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Finally, with the $5.00 tip, the total is $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. If there are 12 blue gumballs, and there are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs, we need to do a little math.

Four times the number of blue gumballs is 12 * 4 = 48.

Then we add 22: 48 + 22 = 70.


There are 70 pink gumballs.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.  

There are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic, with 4 being manual. That means there are 20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars.

To find the percentage, we do (4 semi-automatic cars / 20 total cars) * 100% = 20%

So the answer is 20%.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many babies as queens, we can think of it like this:

* Imagine the queen bees as a group of 1.
* The baby bees are twice that, so there are 1 * 2 = 2 groups of baby bees.
* The worker bees are twice the number of baby bees, meaning there are 2 * 2 = 4 groups of worker bees.

That means there are a total of 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 groups of bees.

Since there are 700 bees in total, each group has 700 / 7 = 100 bees.

So, there are 4 * 100 = 400 worker bees.

His food items (milk and eggs) cost $2 + $3 = $5.

The non-food items (light bulbs, cups, and roach traps) cost $3 + $3 + $4 = $10.

There's a 10% tax on those non-food items, so that's $10 * 0.10 = $1 extra.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. John has a lot of pineapples! 

Since he gets 100 pineapples per hectare and has 10 hectares, that's 1000 pineapples per harvest (100 * 10 = 1000).

He harvests every 3 months, so in a year (12 months) he'll harvest 4 times (12 / 3 = 4).

That means he'll have a total of 4000 pineapples in a year (1000 * 4 = 4000).

First, we need to convert the distances to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute:

* Steve: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
* Tim: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

Now, let's calculate how long each of them takes:

* Steve: 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
* Tim: 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Finally, to see how long the winner waits, we find the difference in their times:

* 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes


The winner will be waiting for **4** minutes.

"Let's break this down step by step!

* The seagull ate half the fries Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
* That means there were 14 + 7 = 21 fries left.
* The pigeons ate 3 fries each, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
* So, there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.
* The raccoon took two-thirds of those, which is (2/3) * 12 = 8 fries.
* This leaves 12 - 8 = 4 fries.
* Since 5 fries were left at the very end, there must have been 4 + 1 = 5 fries before the ants got to them.
*  Finally, adding all the fries together, we get 5 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 14 = 43 fries in the pack originally.


There were **43** fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 8 hours of class (2 classes x 2 hours/class x 2 days = 8 hours).

That means he has a total of 17 hours of class each week (9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours).

In two years, Brooke will be 'b + 2' and Seth will be '2b + 2'.  We know that in two years, their ages added together will be 28.

So, (b + 2) + (2b + 2) = 28

Combining like terms, we get 3b + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us 3b = 24

Dividing both sides by 3, we find that b = 8.

Since Seth is twice Brooke's age, Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Josie has 10 acres of grapes, and each acre gives her 5 tons of grapes. That's a total of 50 tons of grapes (10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons).  Since each ton makes 2 barrels of wine, she can make 100 barrels in total (50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels).

"Let's break down Carl's cheesy week!

* He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich for 7 days, so that's 2 * 7 = 14 slices.
* For his omelets, he used 2 slices + 1 extra slice = 3 slices per omelet, and he had those 3 days a week, for a total of 3 * 3 = 9 slices.
* Finally, his macaroni and cheese used 8 slices.

Adding it all up: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese!

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many pens Janet has. 

She starts with 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, that's 22 + 10 = 32 pens.

Then she buys 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag, so that's 6 * 9 = 54 blue pens.

She also gets 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag, meaning she has 2 * 6 = 12 red pens.

In total, Janet has 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many kilometers Micheal biked. 

In the first four weeks, he biked 5 times a week at 25 kilometers each time, so that's 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers per week. Over four weeks, he biked 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Then, for three weeks, he biked 2 times a week at 60 kilometers each time, meaning he biked 2 * 60 = 120 kilometers per week. Over three weeks, that's 120 * 3 = 360 kilometers.

Adding up both periods, Micheal biked a total of 500 + 360 = 860 kilometers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

A chocolate bar weighs 40g, and a candied apple weighs half that, so 40g / 2 = 20g.

There are 25 chocolate bars, so they weigh a total of 25 * 40g = 1000g.

The 80 candied apples weigh 80 * 20g = 1600g.

Adding those together, the whole bag weighs 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say Jerry has 'r' red chickens and 'w' white chickens. We know:

* White chickens lay 5 eggs a day, and red chickens lay 3.
* Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so w = r + 2.
* He collects 42 eggs every day.

So, the total eggs from red chickens are 3r, and the total eggs from white chickens are 5w.  This means:

3r + 5w = 42

We also know w = r + 2, so let's substitute that in:

3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

Now we can solve for 'r':

3r + 5r + 10 = 42
8r + 10 = 42
8r = 32
r = 4


Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The park's perimeter is what Gary walks, and to find that we add up all the sides: 1.5 miles + 6 miles + 1.5 miles + 6 miles = 15 miles.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Sloane counted 100 customers on the first day and 150 on the second (100 + 50 = 150). That means in the first two days, she counted 250 customers (100 + 150 = 250).

Since the total for three days was 500, she must have counted 250 customers on the third day (500 - 250 = 250).

"Let's break this problem down.

Think about what we know:

* Both pools are losing water at the same rate, 4 gallons every minute.
* Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice the water of the small pool.
* Now, the big pool has four times the water of the small pool.

Let's use 'x' to represent how much water is in the small pool right now. This means the big pool has 4x water right now.

Four minutes ago, the big pool had 2x water, and the small pool had x + 16 water (since it lost 16 gallons in those four minutes).

We know that 2x + 16 (the big pool's water four minutes ago) is equal to 4x (the big pool's water now).

Solving for x, we get:

2x + 16 = 4x
16 = 2x
x = 8


So the small pool has 8 gallons of water now.

If she pays $165 each month for 12 months, she'll have paid a total of $165 * 12 = $1980.

That means her remaining balance will be $2200 - $1980 = $220.

Harriet is 21 now, and Adrian is three times her age, so Adrian is 3 * 21 = 63 years old. Zack is twice Harriet's age, making him 21 * 2 = 42 years old.

In three years, Harriet will be 24, Adrian will be 66, and Zack will be 45.  That means their total age will be 24 + 66 + 45 = 135 years.  

The average age of the three in three years will be 135 / 3 = 45 years old.

Together, Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna scored 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points.

Adding the tax to the car cost gives us: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.

Don't forget the registration! That's another 12 cars * $1000/car = $12,000.

On Tuesday, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies, for a whopping 26 * 200 = 5200 calories. Her sister had 13 cookies, which is 13 * 200 = 2600 calories.

In total, Sue ate 4000 + 5200 = 9200 calories, while her sister ate 1000 + 2600 = 3600 calories.

"Okay, let's break this down.  

It takes 20 minutes to get the oil to 300 degrees, and then it takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees. That means it takes an extra 20 * 0.40 = 8 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much the real estate agent spent. 

He spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50, so that's 50 * $5 = $250.

He spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15, so that's 15 * $75 = $1125.

Adding those together, his total cost was $250 + $1125 = $1375.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Each house has 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows in the bedrooms.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

The collar takes 1/10th the stitches of the body, so that's 900 stitches / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice the collar stitches, meaning it uses 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches.

Together, the body, collar, and rosette use 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches = 1170 stitches.

Since the whole sweater is 1800 stitches, each sleeve must use (1800 stitches - 1170 stitches) / 2 = 315 stitches.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on seeds. 

She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so that's 20 * $40 = $800.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Sean's song has 54 lines. His first scene has twice that many lines, which is 108 lines, but he only has to memorize a third of those, so that's 36 lines. His second scene has 6 more lines than his song, making it 60 lines long. He needs to memorize four-fifths of those lines, which is 48 lines.

Adding up all his lines, Sean has to memorize 36 + 48 + 54 = 138 lines.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, Carly has 80 cards, and 2/5 of them have the letter A, so that's 32 cards (80 * (2/5) = 32).

That leaves 48 cards (80 - 32 = 48). Then, half of those have the letter B, which is 24 cards (48 * (1/2) = 24).

That means 24 cards are left (48 - 24 = 24).  Of those, 5/8 have the letter C, which is 15 cards (24 * (5/8) = 15).

Finally, 9 cards are left with the letter D (24 - 15 = 9).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Matthew needs 3 minutes per small hole and he's digging 30 of those, so that's 3 * 30 = 90 minutes. For the large holes, it's 10 minutes each and he's doing 15, meaning 10 * 15 = 150 minutes.  

In total, that's 90 + 150 = 240 minutes of digging.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he'll be digging for 240 / 60 = 4 hours.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Sam's current age is ""s"". Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby's current age is ""6s"".

In 9 years, Sam will be ""s + 9"" years old, and Ruby will be ""6s + 9"" years old.  We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so:

6s + 9 = 3(s + 9)

Let's solve for ""s"":

6s + 9 = 3s + 27
3s = 18
s = 6

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The mambas have 60 mambas * 35 spots/mamba = 2100 spots. That means all the snakes have 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots together. Half of that is 4900 spots / 2 = 2450 spots.

His flight ticket is a bit trickier: 5 times the cost of a suit is $500, and $700 more than that is $1200.

So far, he's spent $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

If he started with $6000 and wants to save $2000, he has $6000 - $2000 = $4000 left for expenses and gifts.

If we call the number of players on defense ""d"", we know the offense has twice that many, or 2*d* players. The special teams have half the number of players as the defense, which is *d*/2.

Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up an equation: 2*d* + *d* + *d*/2 = 105

Combining the 'd' terms, we get 3.5*d* = 105.

Dividing both sides by 3.5 gives us *d* = 30.


So there are **30** players on the defense.

Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers, so they make $2400 each. With 60 senior programmers, the company pays them $144,000 (60 programmers * $2400/programmer).

In the first year, the stock goes up 50%, which is a $4 increase per share (0.50 * $8 = $4).  So, each share is now worth $12.

The second year, the stock drops 25%, which is a $3 decrease per share (0.25 * $12 = $3). This brings the price down to $9 per share.

Finally, Maria's 8 shares are worth 8 * $9 = $72.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If two of the groups are the same size, and the third is 10 smaller, we can think of it like this:

* Let's say each of the bigger groups has 'x' students.
* The smaller group has 'x - 10' students.

All together, that's 2x + (x - 10) = 200 students.

Combining like terms, we get 3x - 10 = 200.

Adding 10 to both sides gives us 3x = 210.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 70.

So, the smaller group has 70 - 10 = 60 students.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can think of the chickens as two groups, each the same size as the group of cows. That means there are three equal groups of animals in total.

Since he has 60 animals, each group must have 60 / 3 = 20 animals.

* Cows: 20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
* Chickens: 40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

Adding those up, all the animals have 80 + 80 = 160 legs.

"Let's break it down! Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 each week for four weeks, so that's 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 balls.  Oops! He drops 3, but luckily 2 are caught. That leaves him with 6 - 3 + 2 = 5 balls.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

The pink frog, blue beetle, and green toad all weigh the same, which is 50 pounds. The yellow snake is 10 pounds heavier than the frog, making it 60 pounds. The red bird is 20 pounds lighter than the frog, so it weighs 30 pounds.

Adding up the weights of all the animals: 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 190 pounds.

Don't forget the container weighs 20 pounds, so the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  Tyson needs to run 1/5 more than his usual 5000 meters, so that's an extra 1000 meters (5000 * (1/5) = 1000).  That means he'll run 6000 meters each day (5000 + 1000 = 6000).

Over the 30 days of June, he'll cover a total of 180000 meters (6000 * 30 = 180000).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Davos got a great deal!  Since each shirt was $30 and he saved 40%, he saved $30 * 0.40 = $12 on each shirt. That means each shirt cost him $30 - $12 = $18. For two shirts, he paid $18 * 2 = $36.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

They used to make $1000 per day selling tractors (10 tractors * $100/tractor). Now they make $1100 per day selling silos (5 silos * $220/silo). That's $100 more each day.

To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the original amount and multiply by 100%: ($100 / $1000) * 100% = 10%

They are making 10% more per day now.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Madeline spends on her furry friend. 

Food costs $25 a week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so that's $25 * 4 = $100 per month on food.

Adding in the $20 for treats and $100 for medicine, her total monthly cost is $100 + $20 + $100 = $220.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

John spent half the time boating swimming, so that's 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours swimming.

His shows took 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours.

That means he spent 6 hours + 3 hours + 6 hours = 15 hours on those activities.

Since that's 30% of his total time, his whole vacation was 15 hours / 0.30 = 50 hours long.

Finally, he spent 50 hours * 0.40 = 20 hours sightseeing.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much more money Annabelle needs. 

She wants a $400 phone and already has $80 saved. That means she needs $400 - $80 = $320 more.

But wait! She's got two jobs.  From her first job, she'll earn $10/hour * 20 hours = $200.

And from her second job, she'll earn $5/hour * 15 hours = $75.

That's a total of $200 + $75 = $275 from her jobs.

Adding that to her savings, she'll have $275 + $80 = $355.

So, she still needs $400 - $355 = $45.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find the total distance of the train's route. It goes 75 miles, then 100 miles, and then 125 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs). That's a total of 300 miles for one round trip.

Since the train does this three times a day, it travels 900 miles each day (300 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 900 miles/day).

Finally, to find out how many days it can go between services, we divide the total service interval by the daily mileage: 18,000 miles / 900 miles/day = 20 days.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down. 

We know 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks. Four times that number, minus 5, were kicked out for shoplifting, so that's (3 * 4) - 5 = 7 shoplifters.

Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for violence, meaning 7 * 3 = 21 people.

In total, 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people were kicked out for those reasons.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the total cost of the senior gifts. 

First, the picture frames will cost 44 seniors * $20/frame = $880.

Etching each frame adds an extra 20%, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4 per frame.  So, etching all the frames will cost 44 seniors * $4/frame = $176.

Two seniors get pins at $5 each, for a total of 2 seniors * $5/pin = $10.

Since 1/4 of the seniors are officers, there are 44 seniors / 4 = 11 officers.  Each officer needs a cord that costs $12, so the total cord cost is 11 officers * $12/cord = $132.

Adding all the costs together, we get $880 + $176 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

* Interest = ($3650 * 10 * 5) / 100
* Interest = $1825

Now, let's find the total amount Karan needs to repay:

* Total amount = Principal + Interest
* Total amount = $3650 + $1825
* Total amount = $5475

Finally, divide the total amount by the number of months:

He buys 40 fewer corns than his new cannoli total, meaning he gets 100 - 40 = 60 corns.

Adding his new corn to his original amount, he has 80 + 60 = 140 corns.

Finally, adding all the corn and cannolis together, Allan has 140 + 100 = 240 corns and cannolis.

"Let's figure this out! Elliott needs to take 10,000 steps. He did half on his way to and from school, which is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. Then he walked 1,000 more with his friend, for a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.  Since he only has 2,000 left to go, he must have taken 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Toby has a 45-page book with 200 words on each page, so that's 45 * 200 = 9000 words total.

He reads 300 words per minute, so the book will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes.

Adding the 10 minutes to get to the airport, he needs 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.

Since he has 60 minutes before he needs to be at the airport, he'll be 60 - 40 = 20 minutes early.

"Hi there! Let's break down this problem. 

In May, the company paid each of its 40 employees $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. That means each employee earned $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = $2400 per month.  So, the total pay for May was $2400/employee * 40 employees = $96,000.

In June, a quarter of the employees left, leaving 40 employees * (3/4) = 30 employees.  The company still paid each of these employees $2400 per month, for a total of $2400/employee * 30 employees = $72,000.

Adding the pay for both months, the company paid a total of $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Sally has left.

* The taffy deal is a bit tricky. Two pounds would normally cost $6, but since the second pound is half off, it costs $3 + ($3 / 2) = $4.50.
* Her magnets cost $0.25 each, and she got 4, so that's $0.25 * 4 = $1.00.
* In total, she spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00.

That means Sally has $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Tim spent on fireworks. 

The second package cost twice as much as the first, so it was $400 * 2 = $800.

Together, the two packages cost $400 + $800 = $1200.

He got a 20% discount, which is $1200 * 0.20 = $240 off.

After the discount, the packages cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Finally, adding the finale firework, his total cost was $960 + $150 = $1110.

Joanne gets 30 apples from the tallest trees and half that from the shortest, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples. Her sister gets twice the amount from the tallest trees (30 * 2 = 60 apples) and three times the amount from the shortest (15 * 3 = 45 apples).  

Together, they got 60 + 45 + 30 + 15 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.

Since they gathered 500 apples total, Joanne must have gotten 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say there are 'c' camels and 'd' dromedaries.

Each camel has 2 humps, and each dromedary has 1 hump.  We know:

*  The total number of heads is 180: c + d = 180
* The total number of humps is 304: 2c + d = 304

We can solve these equations to find the number of dromedaries ('d').

If we subtract the first equation from the second, we get:

(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180

This simplifies to: c = 124

Now, we can plug this value of 'c' back into either of the original equations to find 'd'. Let's use the first equation:

124 + d = 180

Subtracting 124 from both sides, we get:

d = 56



There are **56** dromedaries.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many kilometers Tom traveled. 

In the first four days, he traveled 200 kilometers each day, so that's 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days, which is 800 * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.

He took a break on the next day, so no kilometers there.

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for seven days, totaling 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.

Adding all of these distances together: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.

"Let's break this problem down!

Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park ticket and has $50 left over for spending money, meaning he made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his cards.

Since he sells each card for $1.50, he sold $50 / $1.50 = 33.33 cards.  Since he can't sell parts of cards, he sold 33 cards.

He sold 2/3 of his cards and kept 1/3, so those 33 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection. To find the total number of cards he started with, we can set up a proportion:

(2/3) * Total Cards = 33 cards

To solve for the total, divide both sides by (2/3):

Total Cards = 33 cards / (2/3) = 49.5 cards.

Since he can't have half a card, Kenny must have started with 50 cards.

The window being open for 30 minutes is like half an hour, and the house cools down 2 degrees every 10 minutes. So in 30 minutes, it cools down 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

So now he has 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.

Uh oh, but then he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.  That leaves him with 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to know the total length of the remoras. Since each one is 6 inches long and there are two, that's 6 inches * 2 = 12 inches.

Now, the shark is 10 feet long, which is 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.

To find the percentage, we divide the remoras' length by the shark's length and multiply by 100%: (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% = 10%.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Jason has 21 days to break in his shoes (3 weeks * 7 days/week). Since he walks 4 days a week, that's a total of 21 days * 4 days/week = 84 days of walking.

To find out how long he needs to walk each day, we divide the total walking time (240 minutes) by the number of walking days (84 days): 240 minutes / 84 days = 2.86 minutes per day.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out the cost of Tom's anniversary getaway.

The hotel is 20% more expensive than its usual $1500 per day because it's a busy weekend. That means the markup is $1500 * 0.20 = $300 per day.

So, the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

For a 3-day stay, the hotel will cost $1800 * 3 = $5400.

The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since there are two of them, that's $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Adding the hotel and plane ticket costs, the total trip cost is $5400 + $10000 = $15400.

Then, $20 less than that is $240 - $20 = $220.


So, Jillian's bag cost $220.

Over five days, he'll need 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Since each bag has 50 pounds, Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.

"Okay, let's figure this out!  

Nine cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and one is 60 inches.  That means the tallest layer of the pyramid will be 64 inches. The next layer is 3 cheerleaders, so that's 3 * 64 inches = 192 inches. Then we have 2 cheerleaders at 64 inches each, which is 2 * 64 inches = 128 inches. Finally, the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches.

Adding it all up: 64 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 444 inches.

Now, let's convert that to feet: 444 inches / 12 inches/foot = 37 feet.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  

Let's say 'x' is the number of guests.

Venue 1 costs $200 plus $5 per guest for food, so the total cost is $200 + $5x.

Venue 2 costs $25 per guest, so the total cost is $25x.

To find out when the costs are the same, we set the two costs equal to each other: $200 + $5x = $25x

Subtracting $5x from both sides gives us $200 = $20x

Dividing both sides by $20, we find that x = 10.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say Bodhi found 'B' insects. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found B/2 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, meaning she found (B/2) + 7 insects.

Together they found 43 insects, so:

B + (B/2) + (B/2) + 7 = 43

Combining like terms:

B + B + 7 = 43

2B + 7 = 43

2B = 36

B = 18

So Bodhi found 18 insects.

David found half of that, so he found 18 / 2 = 9 insects.

Lily found 7 more than David, so she found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.

* Finally, she rewrites everything, adding another 65 letters.

In total, Elise writes 65 + 65 = 130 letters.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Daniel needs to spend. 

Five notebooks will cost him 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

Two pens will cost him 2 * $0.25 = $0.50.

The calculator is $12.00, and the geometry set is $10.00.

Adding those all up, we get $7.50 + $0.50 + $12.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

But wait! There's a 10% discount.  That means he saves $30.00 * 0.10 = $3.00.

So, Daniel's final cost is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

*  Since 300% represents 4500 jelly beans, 1% is equal to 4500 / 3 = 1500 jelly beans.

*  So, there are 1500 blue jelly beans (100%), 1485 red jelly beans (99%), and 1515 green jelly beans (101%).

*  The difference between green and red jelly beans is 1515 - 1485 = 30.

Finally, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from Lewis' street to see the difference: $95060 - $29100 = $65960.

"Let's calculate the total cost of John's research.

* He starts with $100,000 per month for 5 months, totaling $100,000 * 5 = $500,000.
* His research takes 10 times longer, meaning it lasts 5 months * 10 = 50 months.
* That's 45 months (50 - 5) with increased funding.
* Each of those months costs 50% more, so his monthly funding becomes $100,000 + ($100,000 * 0.50) = $150,000.
* The cost of those 45 months is $150,000 * 45 = $6,750,000.
* Adding the initial cost, the total research cost is $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.

That leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats.

The parents took 1/3 of the remaining seats, which is 54 * (1/3) = 18 seats.

Finally, the students took the rest, so there were 54 - 18 = 36 students.

Next, we need to convert from megabits per second to megabits per hour. There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.  We multiply her speed by 3600: 0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/hour = 72 Mb/hour.

There are 7 days in a week, and it already towed for 3, leaving 7 - 3 = 4 days.

"Hi there! Let's break down this problem. 

First, we need to figure out how much the company spent to buy all the cars. They paid 30% of the $25,000 price per car, so that's $25,000 * 0.30 = $7,500 per car.  Since he sold 10 cars, the total cost was $7,500 * 10 = $75,000.

Next, we find the total money made from selling the cars: 10 cars * $25,000/car = $250,000.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the total sales: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

Finally, James gets a 10% commission on that profit: $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say there are 's' sheep and 'g' geese.

* Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2. So, the total number of legs is 4s + 2g = 70.
* Each animal has one head, so s + g = 20.

We can solve these equations to find the number of sheep.  

If we solve the second equation for 'g', we get g = 20 - s.

Now, substitute this value of 'g' into the first equation: 4s + 2(20 - s) = 70

Simplifying that gives us 4s + 40 - 2s = 70, which further simplifies to 2s = 30.

Therefore, s = 15.

There are **15** sheep on Lee's farm.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If 8 adults each weighing 80 kg are in the elevator with Jack (who we'll assume also weighs 80 kg), that's a total of 9 adults * 80 kg/adult = 720 kg.

The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so they're exceeding the limit by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Katarina has 68 cookies, and that's 5 less than Max. So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

The Cookie Monster has 12 fewer cookies than Max, meaning he has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, giving her 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total, we add up everyone's cookies: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the dress is 140cm long after adding 20cm of lace and extending the original length by 50%, we need to work backwards.

First, subtract the lace: 140cm - 20cm = 120cm. This 120cm represents 150% of the original length (100% + 50% increase).

To find the original length, divide 120cm by 1.50: 120cm / 1.50 = 80cm.


So the original dress was 80cm long.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say the triplets are all 'r' years old. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, that twin is 'r + 7' years old. The other twin is the same age as the first twin, also 'r + 7' years old.

We know that all their ages added together equal 44:  (r + 7) + (r + 7) + r + r + r = 44

Combining like terms, we get: 4r + 14 = 44

Subtracting 14 from both sides: 4r = 30

Dividing both sides by 4: r = 7.5

So each triplet is 7.5 years old.  

Since one twin is 7 years older than a triplet, that twin is 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 years old. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. John has 3 hours, which is 180 minutes, before dinner. His homework will take 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.  That means he has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes for a nap!

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we know the lollipops cost $0.40 each, and he bought 5, so that's 5 * $0.40 = $2.00.

That means the candies cost $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20.

Since he bought 4 candies, each candy costs $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.

Now, for 10 lollipops, it would be 10 * $0.40 = $4.00.

And for 10 candies, it would be 10 * $0.30 = $3.00.

In total, that's $4.00 + $3.00 = $7.00.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Neil saves 2/5 * 20 coins = 8 more coins than Rong each month. That means Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month.

Over ten years, Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

Together, they save 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money John has left. 

The vaccines cost $20 each, so that's 2 * $20 = $40.

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so before the check, his bill is $40.

The heartworm check costs $40 * 0.60 = $24.

Adding that to the vaccine cost, his total bill is $40 + $24 = $64.

Since he brought $125, he'll have $125 - $64 = $61 left.

"Hi there! Let's figure out the price of that fruit crate. 

Okay, so we have 5 bananas, and each banana costs twice as much as an apple, which is $0.50. So each banana costs $1.00.  Then we have 12 apples at $0.50 each, and 7 oranges which cost three times the price of a banana, so $3.00 each.

Let's add it all up:

* Bananas: 5 bananas * $1.00/banana = $5.00
* Apples: 12 apples * $0.50/apple = $6.00
* Oranges: 7 oranges * $3.00/orange = $21.00

Total cost: $5.00 + $6.00 + $21.00 = $32.00


The crate costs $32.00.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many more points class 3B needs.

First, we know Betty did great and got 30% more points than Adam's 50. That's 0.30 * 50 = 15 extra points, so Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 fewer points than Betty, putting him at 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta is a rockstar! She got 3 times more points than Tom, meaning she has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Adding up all their points, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points.

They need 400 points for the trip, so they're still short 400 - 255 = 145 points.

Now, if he bought 30 pounds of blueberries at the store, it would cost $2.50 * 30 = $75.

Finally, to see how much he saved, we subtract the farm cost from the store cost: $75 - $65 = $10.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jake's family can save. 

At the first park, two adults would cost 2 * $26 = $52, and two children would cost 2 * $12 = $24. That's a total of $52 + $24 = $76.

At the second park, two adults would cost 2 * $14 = $28, and two children would cost 2 * $10 = $20.  That's a total of $28 + $20 = $48.

The family would save $76 - $48 = $28 by going to the second park.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

The vendor saves $0.10 per tomato with the new supplier. Since he sells 500 tomatoes a day, his daily savings are $0.10/tomato * 500 tomatoes = $50.

Over a week, he saves $50/day * 7 days/week = $350.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Sean has 56 marbles, and Cal has twice that amount, so Cal has 56 * 2 = 112 marbles. Carl has four times the number of marbles Sean has, meaning Carl has 56 * 4 = 224 marbles.

Together, Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles.

"Hi there!  

To figure this out, we need to see how many students would be in 12 groups. Since each of the 6 groups has 9 students, 12 groups would have 12 * 9 = 108 students.  We need 108 - 54 = 54 more students to make 12 groups.

That means we need **6** more groups.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Candy rents out 60 chairs per day during the week, so that's 60 * 5 = 300 chairs per week. On weekends, she rents 100 chairs per day, meaning she rents 100 * 2 = 200 chairs per weekend.

In total, she rents 300 + 200 = 500 chairs each week. Over a month with 4 weeks, that's 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs.

For two months, she'd rent out 2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.

"Let's break this down!

Gunther starts with 48 bananas. Arnold takes half, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. That leaves Gunther with 48 - 24 = 24 bananas.

Then Gunther adds 25 more, so he has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.

But sneaky Arnold steals 12 more, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther adds 6 more, giving him a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.


Gunther finds 43 bananas.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the third house needs double the amount of the first house, and the first house needs half of the second, we can think of it like this:

* **Second house:**  Let's say the second house needs 'x' cases of shingles.
* **First house:** The first house needs x/2 cases.
* **Third house:** The third house needs 2 * (x/2) = x cases.

Since all three houses need a total of 250 cases, we have: x/2 + x + x = 250

Combining the 'x' terms, we get 2.5x = 250.

Dividing both sides by 2.5, we find that x = 100.

This means the third house needs 100 cases of shingles.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mike's digital movie collection will cost.

First, we need to find out how many movies are in series: 600 movies / 3 = 200 movies.

Since he gets a discount on series, those will cost 200 movies * ($10 * (1/3)) = $666.67.

That leaves 600 movies - 200 movies = 400 movies that aren't in a series.

Of those, 400 movies * 0.40 = 160 movies are older and cost $5 each, for a total of 160 movies * $5 = $800.

The rest, 400 movies - 160 movies = 240 movies, are newer and cost the full $10 each, totaling 240 movies * $10 = $2400.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish.  He bought some more fish, and now he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.  

Let's say he bought 'w' white fish. That means he has 4 + w white fish in total.

The new number of orange fish would be 3 + (17 - w) since the 17 new fish could be a mix of orange and white.

We know the orange fish count is double the white fish count, so:

3 + (17 - w) = 2(4 + w)

Let's solve for 'w':

3 + 17 - w = 8 + 2w
20 - w = 8 + 2w
12 = 3w
w = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.

* They play for 4 hours, which is 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

* Jack uses 240 minutes / 20 minutes/quarter = 12 quarters.
* His two less-skilled friends each use 240 minutes / 10 minutes/quarter = 24 quarters, for a total of 24 * 2 = 48 quarters.
* The really good friend uses 240 minutes / 30 minutes/quarter = 8 quarters.

* Altogether, they use 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.
* That's a total of 68 * $0.25/quarter = $17.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest and fragrance, and the same amount of salt and sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.  

If we think of the zest as 1 part, then the fragrance is also 1 part. Salt and sugar are each 2 parts, and oil is 4 parts. That's a total of 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 parts.

Since the jar holds 10 ounces, each ""part"" is 1 ounce.  

Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John spent. 

He bought 3 goats at $500 each, so that's 3 * $500 = $1500.

He also bought 2 cows at $1500 each, so that's 2 * $1500 = $3000.

In total, John spent $1500 + $3000 = $4500.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Sasha's total points.

In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha's 14 points, so she scored 10 points.

Since Sasha struggles in away games, she scored 6 fewer points than Julie's first-game score in the second game. That means she scored 4 points in the second game.

Adding up both games, Sasha scored a total of 14 + 4 = 18 points.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Kimberly bought a lot of pet food! 

She has 8 packages of cat food with 11 tins each, so that's 8 * 11 = 88 tins of cat food.

She also has 6 packages of dog food with 6 tins each, meaning she has 6 * 6 = 36 tins of dog food.

To find the difference, we subtract: 88 - 36 = 52 tins.

Kimberly has 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say PJ has 'x' cards. Smendrick has three times that amount, so he has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, meaning she has 3x + 12 cards.

All together, they have 341 cards, so: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives us 7x = 329.

Finally, dividing both sides by 7, we find that x = 47.

Becca has 3x + 12 cards, so she has (3 * 47) + 12 = 153 cards.

In total, Cindy had 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.

"Let's figure out how much Milly loses on this boring book!

First, the shipping cost based on weight is $0.35/pound * 4 pounds = $1.40.

Then, the shipping cost based on distance is $0.08/mile * 20 miles = $1.60.

So, the total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00.

Amazon will give her back 75% of the book's price, which is $32 * 0.75 = $24.00.

Finally, Milly's total loss is $32 (original price) - $24 (refund) - $3 (shipping) = $5.00.

That's a total of 8000 + 4000 + 24000 = 36000 bars for the first three weeks.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out. 

First, Britany spends 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes making TikToks.

Then, she spends 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes writing songs.

She also spends 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes on makeup.

That means she spends a total of 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok each week.

Over a month, that's 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes.

Finally, 1128 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 18.8 hours on TikTok each month.

* Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, who can lift 1 inch. That means Saskay can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

* Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

* Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, meaning Naruto can lift 10 * 48 = 480 inches.

* Since there are 12 inches in a foot, Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet high.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Kelly has left. 

First, each pack of chicken costs $10 / 5 = $2. Since each chicken packet costs twice as much as bacon, each chicken packet costs $2 * 2 = $4.

That means 6 packets of chicken cost $4 * 6 = $24.

Each pack of apples costs $4 / 2 = $2, so 7 packs of apples cost $2 * 7 = $14.

The strawberries cost $4 * 3 = $12.

Adding it all up, the total cost is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly has $65 - $60 = $5 left in her budget.

"Hey there! Let's figure this out.  If Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts plus a 15-minute encore, and the whole thing is 65 minutes, we can work backwards. 

First, subtract the encore time: 65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes.

That means her final concert without the encore was 50 minutes long. Since that's twice the length of a usual concert, divide that time in half: 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down.

We know that Peter, Paul, and Jean's ages add up to 100 years.  We also know Paul is 10 years older than John, and Peter's age is the same as Paul's age plus John's age.

To find Peter's age, we can use a bit of algebra. Let's say John's age is ""J"".  That means Paul is ""J + 10"" years old. Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's ages, Peter is ""J + (J + 10)"" years old, which simplifies to ""2J + 10"".

Now, we know that all three ages added together equal 100: J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100

Combining like terms, we get 4J + 20 = 100.

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us 4J = 80.

Finally, dividing both sides by 4, we find that J = 20.

Since Peter's age is 2J + 10, Peter is (2 * 20) + 10 = 50 years old.

* **WidgetMaster 9000:** 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month = 32,400 widgets/month

Since each widget sells for $6, Fern would make:

Finally, dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 5.


So Azibo scored 5 points.

"Let's break this down! Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so he works for 15 hours total (from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM). That means he staples for 900 minutes (15 hours * 60 minutes/hour).

Since he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, he staples in sets of 15 minutes. He staples for 60 sets (900 minutes / 15 minutes/set).

In total, he staples 1800 reports (60 sets * 30 reports/set).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to find out how many beds are empty at the start. Since 1/5 of the 1000 beds are occupied, there are 1000 * (4/5) = 800 unoccupied beds.

Over two weeks, 50 patients are admitted each day, for a total of 50 * 14 = 700 new patients.

That means there will be 200 + 700 = 900 occupied beds.

Finally, subtracting the occupied beds from the total gives us 1000 - 900 = 100 unoccupied beds.

"Let's see... they dug 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes in the first three days.  Then they filled in 2, leaving 29 holes. The island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, so there were 29 / 4 = 7.25 holes at the end of the first day. That doesn't make sense, so the map must be a little off!  

Let's assume there were 7 holes at the end of the first day. That means they dug 29 - 7 = 22 holes on the fourth day.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Let's say Adelwolfe caught 'A' Pokemon.

* Stan caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount, so Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon.
* Alex caught 5 more than Stan, meaning Alex caught (4A - 13) + 5 Pokemon, which simplifies to 4A - 8 Pokemon.

Together they caught 339 Pokemon, so: A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339

Combining like terms: 9A - 21 = 339

Adding 21 to both sides: 9A = 360

Dividing both sides by 9: A = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon.  Let's find out how many Stan caught:

Stan caught 4A - 13 Pokemon, so he caught 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokemon.

Finally, she flew south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, which is 5 * 22 = 110 miles.

To find the total distance between her homes, we need to add up the southward distances and subtract the northward distance: 300 - 36 + 110 = 374 miles.

* For pest and lawn service, he writes one check every three months, or four times a year.

In total, that's 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 checks every three months.

Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped, so she pumped (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

Together on day one, they pumped 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons.

On day two, Wanda pumped 2/3 of her day one amount, which is (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

Ms. B pumped 1/3 of her day one amount, which is (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons.

On day two, they pumped a total of 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 4125 gallons.

"Let's break this problem down.  

Maria's power bank loses charge at different rates, so we need to figure out the total charge loss before we can find the original charge.

First, she loses 9% per hour for 5 hours, which is a total of 9 * 5 = 45% charge loss.

Then, it loses 7% per hour for 3 hours, meaning another 7 * 3 = 21% charge loss.

That's a total of 45% + 21% = 66% charge loss.

If 66% of the charge is gone, then 100% - 66% = 34% is left.

But we know the final charge is only 28%, meaning her friends used 34% - 28% = 6% of the charge.

That 6% represents the charge that was left *after* the initial 66% loss.  

To find the original charge, think of it like this: if 6% is what's left of 34%, what would 100% be?

We can set up a proportion: 6 / 34 = x / 100

Solving for x, we get x = (6 * 100) / 34 = 17.65% (approximately).

To find out how many weeks she needs to work, we divide the down payment by her weekly earnings: $2000 / $1000 per week = 2 weeks.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how many plums Jamaar can buy. 

First, we need to find out how much he spent already.

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

That's a total of $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25 spent.

Jamaar started with $10.00 and spent $9.25, leaving him with $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75.

Since each plum costs $0.25, he can buy $0.75 / $0.25/plum = 3 plums.

"Hi! Let's figure this out. Anne had 15 packs of sweets with 60 pieces each, so that's 15 * 60 = 900 sweets in total. She kept 2 packs for herself, leaving 15 - 2 = 13 packs for her friends.  That's 13 * 60 = 780 sweets to share.  

With 10 friends, each friend gets 780 / 10 = 78 sweets.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the price of carrots goes up by 5% each year, here's how it would look:

* **Year 1:** $120 + (5% of $120) = $126
* **Year 2:** $126 + (5% of $126) = $132.30
* **Year 3:** $132.30 + (5% of $132.30) = $138.92

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the carrots would cost $139 after three years.

There are 60 questions total, and 40% are easy, so that's 60 * 0.40 = 24 easy questions.  The rest, 60 - 24 = 36 questions, are split evenly between average and difficult, meaning there are 36 / 2 = 18 of each.

Aries gets 75% of the easy questions right, so that's 24 * 0.75 = 18 easy questions correct. She gets half of the average and difficult ones right, so that's 18 * 0.50 = 9 correct for each type.

In total, she's sure to get 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 questions right.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, which cost $4 each.  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and made $120 in total.

Let's say she sold 'x' large stuffed animals. That means she sold 2x small stuffed animals.

Large stuffed animals cost $12 each (3 * $4).

So, she made 12x dollars from large stuffed animals and 8x dollars from small stuffed animals (4 * 2x).

In total, she made 12x + 8x = $120.

Combining like terms, we get 20x = $120.

Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.

Since she sold 2x small stuffed animals, she sold 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

"Let's break this down!

A dwarf with just his hands mines 12 pounds a day. With an iron pickaxe, he mines twice that, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds a day. A steel pickaxe is 50% better than iron, meaning he mines an extra 24 * 0.50 = 12 pounds. That brings his total with a steel pickaxe to 24 + 12 = 36 pounds a day.

Over a 30-day month, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 * 30 = 1080 pounds.

With 40 dwarves, they'd mine a total of 1080 * 40 = 43200 pounds.

"Let's figure this out!

There are a few ways Marcus could avoid turning in his homework:

* **Substitute Teacher:** If a substitute comes, he's off the hook! That's a 50% chance.
* **Extension:** Even with his regular teacher, there's a 40% chance the whole class gets an extension.
* **Dog Ate It:** If there's no class extension, there's still a 20% chance Marcus can convince his teacher his dog ate his homework.

So, to find the chance he *actually* has to turn it in, we need to look at the chances he *doesn't* get out of it:

*  Regular teacher, no extension, no dog excuse: This is the only scenario where he's definitely turning it in.

Let's calculate that probability:

*  Chance of regular teacher: 50%
*  Chance of no extension: 60% (100% - 40%)
*  Chance of no dog excuse: 80% (100% - 20%)

Multiply those together: 50% * 60% * 80% = 24%

That means there's a 24% chance Marcus will have to turn in his homework.

**Answer:** 24%

Finally, he sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each, which totals 20 * $1.50 = $30.00.

Adding all that up, Terry makes $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00.

"Let's figure this out! 

Train 1 takes 20 minutes to arrive and then stays for another 20 minutes. Train 2 arrives 30 minutes after Train 1 leaves, which means it arrives after 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 minutes. Train 2 only stays for 5 minutes (20 / 4 = 5).

Train 3 arrives an hour after Train 2 leaves, so that's 60 + 5 + 60 = 125 minutes.  Train 3 leaves immediately, and Train 4 arrives 20 minutes later, at 125 + 20 = 145 minutes.

So Paul waits for 145 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks a week for 12 weeks, so that's 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks. She needs 200 toothpicks total, so she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 more.  Since she saves 10 each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks.

"Hi there! Let's break this down. 

Mr. Rogers got the watch for 75% of $2000, which is $1500. Then, he sold it for 120% of that price, meaning he sold it for $1800.  That's a $200 discount from the original $2000 price.

To find the percentage discount, we divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100%: ($200 / $2000) * 100% = 10%

So the answer is 10%.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Jenny bought 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

If she bought them individually, it would cost 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Since she bought them in bunches, it cost her 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

That means she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00!

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can think of it like this:

*  Sam's fence + Harry's fence = Total fence
*  Let's say Sam gets 'x' feet of fence. Harry gets 'x + 60' feet.
*  So, x + (x + 60) = 100 feet

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 60 = 100.

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives us 2x = 40.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 20.

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Marcel's earnings.

Here's how we can break it down:

* **Trekking Bikes:** He sold 300 bikes / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.
* **BMX Bikes:** He sold 300 bikes * 15% = 45 BMX bikes.
* **MTB Bikes:** That leaves 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 MTB bikes.

* **BMX Price:** Each BMX bike costs $500 / 2 = $250.

Now let's calculate his earnings:

* **Trekking Earnings:** 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
* **BMX Earnings:** 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
* **MTB Earnings:** 105 bikes * $500/bike = $52,500

Finally, add it all up: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250


Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles that month.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. The farmer makes 30 bales in a day (5 bales/hour * 6 hours). The truck picks up 18 bales (3 bales/hour * 6 hours). That means there are 12 bales left in the field (30 bales - 18 bales).

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

John has 8 classes a day (6 normal + 2 extra) and each class is 40 minutes long. That's 8 * 40 = 320 minutes of class each day.

Over a week, that's 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes.

He spends another 1600 minutes / 16 = 100 minutes on each weekend day for extra learning.

So, his total weekend learning time is 100 minutes/day * 2 days = 200 minutes.

Adding it all up, his total weekly learning time is 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

That's equal to 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours a week!

"Let's think about this like a puzzle!  The Allosaurus ate the last bit, which was 270 kg. That was half of what the velociraptors left behind. So, before the velociraptors got there, there must have been 270 kg * 2 = 540 kg.

But remember, that 540 kg was only half of what the T-Rex left!  That means the triceratops originally had 540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg of meat.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much it will cost to paint Tony's room. 

First, we need to find the total area of all the walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so they each have an area of 80 square feet. Since there are two of them, that's 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.

The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, giving us 40 square feet each. With two of those walls, that's another 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.

Adding those together, the total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, so Tony will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.

Finally, at $12 per gallon, the total cost will be 12 * $12 = $144.

"Hi there!  Let's figure this out.

The slower train travels at 30 miles per hour (half the speed of the faster train).  

In 3 hours, the faster train will have traveled 180 miles (60 miles/hour * 3 hours). The slower train will have traveled 90 miles (30 miles/hour * 3 hours).

Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we add those distances together to find the total distance between them: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles.

She needs to hike 1800 more miles (9300 - 7500 = 1800). To do that in 30 days, she needs to hike an extra 60 miles each day (1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day).

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, he needs 240 / 12 = 20 dozen eggs.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, meaning for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  If there are 84 passengers in total, that represents 14 parts (5 + 9).  

Each ""part"" of the ratio is equal to 84 passengers / 14 parts = 6 passengers.

Initially, there were 9 parts of women, so there were 9 * 6 = 54 women on the bus.

After 20 women get off, there are 54 - 20 = 34 women left.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

Faraday makes $2 per sunflower and $8 per bouquet. Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, that means he makes $8 / 12 = $0.67 per sunflower in a bouquet.

So, he makes a total of $2 + $0.67 = $2.67 per sunflower each day.

Over 3 days, he'd make $2.67/sunflower/day * 3 days = $8.01 per sunflower.

He earned $26 from individual sunflowers + $56 from bouquets = $82 over 3 days.

That means he sold $82 / $2.67 per sunflower = 30.7 sunflowers. Since he can't sell parts of sunflowers, he sold 30 sunflowers.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

First, we need to see how much energy 2300 people need in total. Since each person needs 100% of their daily energy, that's 2300 people * 100% = 230,000% of daily energy.

Now, let's see how much energy Hortex currently provides. They make 4200 bottles, and each bottle covers 20% of a person's needs, so that's 4200 bottles * 20% = 84,000% of daily energy.

To find the difference, we subtract: 230,000% - 84,000% = 146,000%.

Finally, since each bottle covers 20%, Hortex needs to produce 146,000% / 20% = 7300 more bottles.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much John makes. 

First, let's find the total apartments in the first two complexes: 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% bigger than those two combined, so it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments.

That means the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

In total, John collects from 400 + 400 + 640 = 1440 apartments.

Since he collects from each place 3 times a week, that's 1440 * 3 = 4320 collections.

Finally, he earns $0.40 per collection, so he makes 4320 * $0.40 = $1728.00 per week.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. 

Let's say the blue rope is 'b' centimeters long.  The yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than the blue rope, so it's 'b + 7' centimeters long. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, making it '4b' centimeters long.

All together, their lengths add up to 37 centimeters: b + (b + 7) + 4b = 37

Combining like terms, we get 6b + 7 = 37.

Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us 6b = 30.

Finally, dividing both sides by 6, we find that b = 5.

Since the red rope is 4b centimeters long, it's 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters long.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, meaning it's 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Adding the bedrooms and living room, we get 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.

"Hi there! Let's break down this problem step by step.

Thomas starts with $1000, which is equal to 50 twenty-dollar bills. He loses 10 bills, leaving him with 40. Then he uses half of those, which is 20 bills, for a payment. That leaves him with 20 bills.

If he triples his money at this point, he has 20 bills * 3 = 60 bills.  Since each bill is worth $20, he has a total of 60 * $20 = $1200.

Finally, he converts all that money into five-dollar bills. That means he'll have $1200 / $5 = 240 five-dollar bills.

"Let's break this down!

Team B scored 2 fewer goals than Team A in the first half, so they scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, Team B scored 4 times the amount from the first half, meaning they scored 2 * 4 = 8 goals.

Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals Team B did in the second half, so they scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Adding up Team A's goals from both halves, they scored a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals.

Team B scored a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals.

Finally, the total number of goals in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

"Hi there! Let's break this problem down.

Let's say Wendy's current age is ""w"" and Colin's current age is ""c"".

We know:

* Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now:  w = 5(c + 7)
* In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: c + 25 = (1/3)w

From the first equation, we can figure out that w = 5c + 35.

Let's plug that value of 'w' into the second equation:

c + 25 = (1/3)(5c + 35)

Now, let's solve for 'c':

c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
(3/3)c + 25 = (5/3)c + 35/3
75/3 - 35/3 = (5/3)c - (3/3)c
40/3 = (2/3)c
c = (40/3) * (3/2)
c = 20

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Team The Finders snagged 60% of those remaining shells, so they found 420 * 0.60 = 252 shells.

Finally, Team Gogetters found the rest, which is 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  If the first three dogs need to walk 1, 4, and 3 miles, that's a total of 8 miles. Since all four dogs need to walk an average of 3 miles each, they need a total of 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.  That means the last dog needs to walk 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Deandre's earnings. 

First, we add up the weight of all the tunas: 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

First, we need to find the volume of the jar: 6 inches * 6 inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

Since the jelly beans don't pack perfectly, we need to account for the 80% efficiency. That means we have 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches of space for jelly beans.

Now, let's see how many jelly beans fit in that space: 432 cubic inches / 0.15 cubic inches/jelly bean = 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of those are red, so he'd guess 2880 jelly beans * 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

The actual number is 900, so his guess was off by |864 - 900| = 36 jelly beans.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year for 5 years, so that's 3 * 5 = 15 visits.  Each visit costs $2, so she spends 15 * $2 = $30 in those first 5 years.

After 5 years, the price goes up by 150%, which means it increases by $2 * 1.5 = $3. The new price is $2 + $3 = $5 per visit.

For the next 3 years, she makes 3 * 3 = 9 visits. At $5 per visit, that's 9 * $5 = $45.

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75 on museum visits.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, we can think of the board as being divided into 5 equal parts (1 part for the shorter piece and 4 parts for the longer piece).

Since the board is 40 feet long, each of these parts is 40 feet / 5 parts = 8 feet long.

The longer piece is made up of 4 of these parts, so it's 4 parts * 8 feet/part = 32 feet long.

* **Year 2:** Another 30% depreciation means a loss of $6300 * 0.30 = $1890. The boat is now worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

* **Year 3:** This time, it depreciates by 20%, which is $4410 * 0.20 = $882. The final value is $4410 - $882 = $3528.

In total, there are 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 red, orange, and yellow candies. Since the bag has 232 candies, there must be 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Helen spent. 

A bus trip cost 10% of the hotel price, so each bus trip was $80 * 0.10 = $8.

Since she took 7 bus trips, that's a total of $8 * 7 = $56 for buses.

Her hotel stay cost $80 per night for 3 nights, making it $80 * 3 = $240.

Adding the bus and hotel costs, Helen spent $240 + $56 = $296 in total.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

If Dallas has 21 marbles after losing 4, he must have started with 21 + 4 = 25 marbles. That means Mazie gave Dallas 25 marbles, and she gave Darla the rest: 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we need to find the total weight of everything in the car: the car itself, the luggage, and the children. That's 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 1600 pounds.

To move the car, John needs to apply 1% of that weight as force.  So, 1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds.

"
"Hi there! To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we need to find the total length of the fence. Since it's a rectangle, we add up all the sides.  The fence is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide, so that's 20 + 15 + 20 + 15 = 70 feet.

James needs 70 feet of crepe paper. 



"
"Hi there!  

Let's figure this out. If Mia is 40 and they're 16 years apart, Emma must be 56. To find the average, we add their ages (40 + 56 = 96) and then divide by 2 (96 / 2 = 48). 

So the average of their ages is 48. 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

First, we add up all the seashells they found: 214 + 432 + 86 = 732.

Then, we take away the cracked ones: 732 - 67 = 665.

They found 665 good seashells together! 



"
"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Avery will spend.  

Each place setting costs $6.00 + $5.00 + $4.00 = $15.00.

Since she needs 12 place settings, the total cost will be $15.00 x 12 = $180.00.


$180.00

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Half of Steve's time is 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours. Anna took 2 hours longer than that, so it took her 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out.  

Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so that's 4 * 2 = 8 pounds per pig daily.

With five pigs, Dexter needs 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed each day.

Over a week, that's 40 * 7 = 280 pounds.

If Dexter started with 300 pounds, he'll have 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left.

"
"Hi there! Let's figure this out. John needs enough hot dogs for 20 guests, and each guest eats 2 hot dogs, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs.  He already has 4, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more.  Since each pack has 6 hot dogs, he'll need 36 / 6 = 6 packs.  If each pack costs $2, his total cost will be 6 * $2 = $12.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much money Frances has left. 

She earns $40 from selling cupcakes (20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake) and another $40 from cookies (40 cookies * $1/cookie). That's a total of $80 earned.

Her trays cost $20 (5 trays * $4/tray).

Subtracting the cost of the trays from her earnings, Frances has $60 left.

"Okay, let's figure this out! 

So, there are 5 kids at the start. On the second street, each of them brings a friend, making it 5 * 2 = 10 kids. Then on the third street, each of those 10 kids brings two more friends, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 kids. But then the first 5 kids get tired and leave, so we subtract them: 20 - 5 = 15 kids.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out. Charisma meditates for 30 minutes each day (15 minutes in the morning and 15 at night). That's 210 minutes of meditation per week. She also does yoga for an hour, five days a week, which is another 300 minutes.  

So, in total, she practices for 510 minutes each week. Over four weeks, that adds up to 2040 minutes.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how big Octavia's quilt will be. 

* The small shirts add up to 11 shirts * 3 square feet/shirt = 33 square feet.
* The medium shirts add up to 8 shirts * 4 square feet/shirt = 32 square feet.
* The large shirts add up to 6 shirts * 6 square feet/shirt = 36 square feet.

Adding all those together, the quilt will be 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet!

"Let's break this down!

Anne is twice Albert's size, so she's 36"" * 2 = 72"" tall.

Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, meaning she's 72"" - 2"" = 70"" tall now.

Since Jackie grew 3"" over the summer, she was 70"" - 3"" = 67"" tall before.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Jake spent. 

The T-shirts are a bit tricky. Since he gets one half off, the second shirt costs $8 / 2 = $4.  That means the total for the shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

The shoes are on sale for 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.40 = $16.  The shoes cost $40 - $16 = $24.

Adding it all up, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36 at the store.

"Let's figure this out! Ryan earns $6 a week for doing his chores, and he did them for 3 weeks, so he made $6 * 3 = $18.  He spent $1.25 on each of the 4 ice cream cones, for a total of $1.25 * 4 = $5. That means he has $18 - $5 = $13 left. Since movie tickets cost $6.50 each, he can buy $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets.

"Hi there! Let's figure out Tim's profit. 

Here's how we can break it down:

* **Cost of passion fruit per jar:** 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
* **Cost of jackfruit per jar:** 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
* **Cost of honey per jar:** 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20
* **Total cost per jar:** $12 + $12 + $20 = $44
* **Profit per jar:** $50 (selling price) - $44 (cost) = $6
* **Total profit for 10 jars:** $6/jar * 10 jars = $60

Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars.

* The 120 nickels add up to 120 * $0.05 = $6.00.
* And finally, his 750 pennies are equal to 750 * $0.01 = $7.50.

Adding all that up, Justin has $8.00 + $9.50 + $6.00 + $7.50 = $31.00 in his jar.

"Let's figure this out! The dog digs a whopping 84 holes while Nate is gone (6 holes/day * 14 days).  Every day, Nate fills 9 holes but the dog digs 6 more, so he's making progress by 3 holes each day (9 - 6 = 3).  To fill all 84 holes, it will take him 28 days (84 holes / 3 holes/day). That's equal to 4 weeks (28 days / 7 days/week).

"Let's see... Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, and Jane takes 4 minutes.  In an hour, there are 60 minutes.  

Ana can peel 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges.

"Hi there! Let's figure out how much Mark paid. 

The radiator was originally $400, but he got a great deal at the junk shop – 80% off! That means he saved $400 * 0.80 = $320.  So, the radiator only cost him $400 - $320 = $80.

The mechanic charged $50 per hour for 3 hours of work, so that's $50 * 3 = $150.

Adding the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's fee, Mark paid a total of $80 + $150 = $230.

"Hi there! Let's figure this out.

If we let 'c' be the number of chickens and 'w' be the number of cows, we know:

*  c + w = 20 (total animals)
*  2c + 4w = 70 (total legs)

We can solve for 'c' by substituting the first equation into the second:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

Simplifying that gives us:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70
-2c = -10
c = 5

So there are **5** chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.
